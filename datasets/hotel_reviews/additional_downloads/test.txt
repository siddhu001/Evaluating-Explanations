0	[CLS] If traveling to Chicago ( City ) , the O ##m ##ni is a great value , especially for the level of service and quality of stay you receive for the price . The staff are very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the rooms are new , Modern and very clean . The location of the hotel is in a safe area , and near shopping and good restaurants . In short , if you want to stay in a newly renovated hotel be treated like royalty , for a reasonable price , the Chicago O ##m ##ni is where it ' s at . [SEP]

We were on the 28th floor with great views ! Front desk were quick , efficient , and ever so friendly ! Will definitely stay again ! Thanks for the great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent staff made the stay perfect ! Pa ##ola was so persona ##ble and sweet , what a g ##em to have at this hotel . She made our day ! ! Room ##s are very ch ##ic and nicely appointed . The views could not be any better on the magnificent mile . Perfect location in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a company meeting , and had a great stay . From the point of check - in to all the amenities , restaurant , bar , everyone was very at ##ten ##tive , helpful , and court ##eous . Room was a good size and clean . Me ##als provided to the conference room were ta ##sty , and fresh . Great snack ##s were provided too . Easy , central location . Walking distance to the ferry boat architectural tours , shopping , and parks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A home away from home . Except ##ional ##ly welcoming staff . Environmental ##ly friendly spa ##co ##ius rooms and good view the river across . W ##i ##F ##i , Television , Bar , Room service , Coffee , and meals . Re ##mind ##s me of Zurich experience ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] High ##ly recommend the American Girl package . My daughter loved the treats , gifts and the overall experience . Will do this again when our youngest gets a little older . Well worth the money and the lifetime memory it helped create . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The site is an elegant old historic site with incredible restaurants complete with shops inside . You will spend the first minutes with your mouth gaping open at the beauty of the de ##cor . It is located inside the loop and within walking distance of the Sa ##pping ##ton fountain . You really get a sense of the vital ##ity of the city as just walking around the block . The restaurants are f ##abulous and there are too many restaurants nearby to try on a stay . We loved the corner bakery and mac ##aroo ##ns at the sweet bites sites . The rooms have been recently updated . Public transport is available right outside the door . And the staff is wonderful . Park ##ing is a little trick ##y to figure out . . 490 [SEP]
1	[CLS] I liked the location and historic / bout ##ique character . However even in a " del ##uxe " room there were no convenient AC outlets , coffee / tea kit , or decent s ##ham ##po ##o / condition ##er . The air condition ##er was loud and to use the heating overnight you had to leave the curtains open . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel while I was in Chicago for a conference . I stayed in the west wing up on the 14th floor and had a beautiful view . I was so grateful ! The hotel has everything you ’ d want if you ’ re staying somewhere for several days on business . It had great in room dining options , a large bar and restaurant and lots of lounge space . I hope to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our 3 night ' s in this wonderful hotel . Fantastic location , stunning rooms and bathroom , great service and lovely staff . The ch ##rist ##mas decorations and music provided a wonderful welcoming atmosphere . Room service was amazing as was the food ! Could not fault this place . . . loved it [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a 4 . 5 star hotel , I had high expectations . . . Sad ##ly , my family vacation , birthday celebration was let down on so many levels . The de ##cor is out dated , customer service is very poor , staff doesn ' t listen and they out right lie to you in your face . Problem after problem continued to occur during our stay . Though they did upgrade our room that was only a fraction of compensation that should take place . In my opinion , the in ##fra ##ctions should not even that place on the level that they did to where one would need to be placed from a room to a suite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great traditional hotel right near Lake Michigan . It is well maintain . It has a historical feel , although the rooms have been modern ##ized . The price of the room was reasonable given the options in the area and there is a nice bar in the hotel . The only downfall is that parking is ridiculous ##ly expensive , although about the same rates of other hotels on the block . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our first visit to the Ki ##nz ##ie started off with a couple of hi ##cc ##ups but this stay was fl ##aw ##less . We were given a business card from Robert and he told us to reach out to him if we were to ever return back and he promised us he would take care of us and boy did he ever ! Let me preface this with saying I ' ve stayed at some of the best hotels throughout the country due to my work but the service delivered at this hotel is bar none . Robert went out of his way to ensure we experienced the best stay possible and because of that I will continue to stay here any time I visit Chicago . Based off of my two stays here at the hotel I have told the rest of my colleagues about your hotel and instructed them to book Ki ##nz ##ie ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is the best place to stay in Chicago . Everything you want to see in Chicago is literally steps outside of the hotel . The hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful . The food was great and the overall service was perfect ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The rooms are beautiful , the restaurant is delicious and it ' s located right in the heart of Chicago . The staff was so kind and helpful , we didn ' t have one problem while staying here and would definitely stay there again . The price is a bit high for an average vacation , but would make a great special trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cut ##e hotel ! Clean & great location . Walking distance to the main sites . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Our first room looked at a parking garage and the lady at the front desk changed our room without has ##sle for one with a view of the river - Ask for a river view room . The bench in the window is worth the upgrade ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is fantastic , near Michigan Ave and also not far from Beach . Also it is quite at night ( I was on 9th floor ) , no problem for me to sleep . One thing not convenient ( for me ) is that there is no ve ##nding machine . You need to cross around 1 block to find a grocery store . Not too far . And carpet is not that clean but acceptable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Total ##ly recommend this hotel . It ' s in an excellent location just off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and every thing about it is s ##ty ##lish . The room was very comfortable , well furnished and functional . The staff was very friendly , professional and welcoming . A small problem with the bill was re ##ct ##ified im ##mme ##dia ##tel ##y . Would certainly stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I spent 3 nights over the Pass ##over / Easter long weekend here , for the third time in four years and we continue to find the Monaco a top notch hotel . Front desk staff are friendly , efficient and welcoming . The rooms are of a generous size , even our corner room , overlooking an alley , with no window box this time . Total ##ly fine . It was quiet and that ' s what we wanted . The rooms are in great shape . Immaculate . No s ##cu ##ffs or scratch ##es . Common areas are well kept . The expanded gym is also really nicely appointed and a big improvement over what it used to be . The only complaint I could have were the client ##ele , this weekend . P ##lent ##y of rude , noisy people being loud in the hallway ##s in the early morning hours . Aside from that , it was a perfect stay and we will be going back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice , ch ##ic and calm place . I ##dea ##l to relax and enjoy the city . Near of everything with a fantastic view of the river from the room ! The room was exactly as described in the Swiss ##ote ##l Web site . One thing was missing , a Swiss coffee machine : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel lived up to expectations and the experience at check in exceeded them . We received an upgrade without requesting it . Even without the upgrade I would rate the hotel good value for the money . Location was good , close to the magic mile and within 20 min walk from Mile ##nn ##ium park [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Conrad for two nights & were really pleased with the hotel . It ’ s met ##ic ##ulously clean , f ##abulous location & our two queen room was so s ##pec ##ious . The bathroom was large & laid out well . Everything was contemporary & a huge plus were the remote control black out shades . The staff was very persona ##ble & overall the hotel is lovely . We will stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great , central location meaning you can walk to so many places of interest if you choose to . The Hotel is q ##ua ##int with a convenient restaurant and lounge on the ground floor where reception is also found although initially it is difficult to find . We found all 3 employees who manned the help desk went the extra mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great week at the Ki ##nz ##ie while helping my daughter move to to Chicago . Super com ##fy beds , amazing staff and wonderful location . Can ’ t wait to go back and stay again Great breakfast and relaxing happy hour add to the experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] I mentioned that it would be my birthday , it was a big one . They gave us a room overlooking the river on the 12th floor . It had a great window seat where we could both comfortably read the paper and look at the river and the sky ##scraper ##s light ##ed up . Also , they gave us a bottle of champagne and cup ##cakes when we checked in - a birthday treat I ' m sure . There was acceptable wine at 5 ##pm everyday . The hotel was clean , lemon or cu ##cum ##ber water was in the lobby always . Coffee was provided in the morning . Room service ( breakfast ) was quick . A really nice smaller hotel . Walking distance to everything . We had a te ##rri ##fic time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel is great , but the service — apart from bell ##hop ##s and v ##alet — is terrible . A simple room request made 48 hours in advance was refused . When we requested additional towels , the desk “ put the order in ” but they never arrived . Our follow - up request was met with a heavy sigh and another empty promise . The hotel is rough . The mattress was s ##loping and bathroom fixtures looked cheap and old . Stay at the Conrad . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve only stayed overnight in Chicago once because mad ##ison is so close . Last hotel didn ’ t like so much . Always wanted stay here as I love old buildings and their history . They did a very nice job of mixing the old with the new . Room was very welcoming and com ##fy . The 2nd bath helped a lot since there was four girls lo ##l . The only complaint I have is that no one explained the extra fee they just sent me on my way and there was no bathroom fan in either bathroom . Otherwise the location was great for where we needed to go . Sad ##ly no pictures this time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a blast at this hotel , lobby is beautiful and staff has been extra friendly to us . Would definitely come again , especially for the happy hour from 5 - 6 . Thank you to Leah for treating us extra well during our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] B ##rough ##t a group of 10 to Chicago for meetings & stayed here , because it was ( 1 ) a great location a block away from the meeting space ( 2 ) well - reviewed and ( 3 ) quite reasonably priced . We were a bit cautious because the price was significantly below other downtown hotels . So we expected to find noticeable def ##ici ##encies ( that we are happy to over ##look for such a lost price ) . Not the case : we loved it . It was clean , well - appointed , efficient . . . and so ##o well located . No complaints at all . We ' ve used other nearby hotels and would rate this one as good as or better than significantly higher priced hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My trip to Chicago was for the purpose of unit ##ing with my fi ##an ##cé . She reside from Star the State of Louisiana . And I reside in the State of Ohio . It was at the Swiss ##ote ##l Hotel that I proposed to her at The Palm Rest ##ura ##nt . The staff helped my out the great moment together . The Hotel Staff including Nicole , Solomon we ’ re great in providing excellent 5 - Star Service for me and my soon to be wife . I just want to say to anyone who is looking for a reasonable hotel to stay at . You need to stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l you will not regret it . Dr . Sean A . Crowley , Sr . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is really nice but the staff are world class , friendly , helpful and just a joy to be around . Antonio , Jon ##ath ##on , Gwen , Ronald , Alexandria , and Se ##l ##wyn all made us feel at home and welcome . They really pulled out all the stops when they located and returned to us safely the electronics and jewelry that we had left in the safe in our hotel room . . and shipped it directly to our home in Switzerland . Such integrity and service ! We have stayed in several nice hotels in Chicago but this one is now top of our list and we can ' t wait to return to see our new friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I took our son to Chicago for the Memorial Day long weekend . This hotel is baby friendly with a comfortable c ##ri ##b for your little one . They were out of c ##ri ##bs when we arrived and the manager drove to a sister property to get one for us which we appreciated . Very close to key attractions like The Bean or the Ma ##g Mile ! The con ##cier ##ge organized a gray architecture tour for us that was also in walking distance . Great location and staff ! A C ##VS pharmacy is right across the street for snack ##s and other incident ##als too . Thank you . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el has wonderful employees , and we are sorry for their loss of wages recently . Chicago ’ s inability to manage its police force , finances and criminals means we aren ’ t coming . Hopefully , the city of Chicago can become safe and enjoyable again someday . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean rooms , delicious food and awesome hospitality at the bar . Everyone was so nice and helpful ; from the bar staff , to the con ##cier ##ge desk and La ##tis ##ha at the front desk who helped me get a last minute room . I had the pleasure of talking with Do ##y from Hilton Grand V ##aca ##tions who was so nice and helpful . He explained the program to me and answered all my questions . I felt like he really cared about giving me the best possible service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a single Saturday night . The bed was very comfortable , but I was disappointed in a few things . First there is no fridge in the room . There was a tiny fridge full of b ##oo ##ze to buy ( which wasn ' t even turned on ! ) but we had nowhere to put left ##overs that we would have liked to have kept . Out ##lets are very in ##con ##ven ##ient ##ly placed . The toilet ran constantly all night , and my towel had a huge yellow crust ##y spot that was full of someone else ' s hair . . . just gross . The t ##v ##s are fine , but very awkwardly placed as well . Overall the bed , the quiet and the pillows were nice , just unfortunate disappointment ##s for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in this beautiful hotel for a work conference . Staff was extremely friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Room was beautiful with 2 bathroom ##s in it . Bar tender was fantastic , even with a full house of guests ! Great location and easy access to Grant Park . Room had a great view as well . I would stay here again without hesitation [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is great - but the bar needs help - you need to ramp up staff , So many people came in there . It is beautiful but you need more help hope to be back soon the rooms are great - out 2 rooms suite was wonderful [SEP]
1	[CLS] Despite the pool being closed for 3 months ( according to the front desk ) there is no update on the website or your room guide ##book . Everything lists the pool as being open until you try to go to floor 42 and go to the pool . The fitness room will re ##ope ##n in October , that IS posted online but the pool is separate . Despite addressing this with the manager I felt there was very little care or consideration . Only if you in ##quire , will they offer access to a fitness center that is 5 minutes away . Parents , don ' t bring your kid ##dos and expect to take them to the fitness center pool . They don ' t allow kids during the weekdays . I don ' t recommend bringing your family / kids to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel . Service is good . The staff are polite . Room and front lobby is amazing . Bed are comfortable , nice large t ##v , small refrigerator in room . We are in room 301 ##7 with a beautiful view lake Michigan . The Palm is an impressive restaurant in the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The contemporary rooms with their com ##fy , firm beds are first - rate . The location steps from Michigan Avenue is ideal . But it ' s the service that truly set this hotel apart . The superb ##ly - trained staff are ho ##sp ##ita ##ble and g ##rac ##ious without being s ##no ##ot ##y . My only request : replace the " in ##tu ##itive " room controls , which are confusing , with good old - fashioned switches ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a good central place located within one block of the red line trains . I found the staff to be friendly but not overly wanting to help , just provided if asked . I ' ve stayed in other properties before where the staff goes out of their way to ensure everything is going well . The room was nice with a sit ##ing area , bedroom , and full kitchen . We used the kitchen a lot and shop ##ped at Trade ##r Joe ' s just 2 blocks away . Overall a good stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was attending a conference and decided to bring my husband and my baby on the trip . I asked in advance if the hotel can provide a k ##ett ##le and a baby ##bed . They provided both plus s ##ham ##po ##o and shower gel for the baby , he also received a little stuffed animal . We liked this hotel a lot , the room was big and staff was very nice . We did not have breakfast included in our rate , so we went out for breakfast , which was totally fine . We would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a theater weekend . Easy walking distance to Hamilton ( 20 minute walk ) , also walking distance to Mill ##ennial park . Right at the Miracle mile for shopping . Close to so many restaurants . Very clean rooms , nice work ##out center . There is not a hot tub in the pool area . . . . which we found out after going down 10 floors and a long wind ##y walk to the pool ( families be ##ware . . . . . long walk and then you have to go through the work ##out room and through the locker room to get to the pool . . . . . could be a problem for parents bringing different gender kids to pool ) . Very comfortable beds . Bath ##room was on the small size , but fine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the time we arrived at this q ##ua ##int well located property with great am ##bian ##ce . Location could not be better , the staff was really helpful and friendly . The rooms were large for Chicago with good linen ##s . Only negative was the TV could have been larger and had a better service provider [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was exactly as expected . Very spacious , and clean . The bathroom was large ; the view of the city was great ; lots of power outlets ; and lots of lighting in the room . The hotel staff was supportive and very nice . Overall , a very great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] just perfect . service was wonderful . very clean . excellent beds and linen . the only pit fall was the shower that was not one of the best , but not bad , though . the location is very good and the staff friendly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall the experience at the hotel was great . The rooms and appearance of the hotel inside was very pleasant . The hotel attracts a lot of people so it seemed busy inside during my stay . I liked that it had a gift shop and bar / food area inside as well and the front desk reception ##ist was really friendly and patient . Also I liked the area of the hotel and that it was close to many of the attractions we were interested in going to during our visit to Chicago such as the Architectural River Cruise . I would recommend this hotel to someone looking to stay in a hotel near downtown Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Words cannot describe my luxurious experience I encountered . Outstanding property . If this place is available when I visit Chi ##ca ##ge , I will stay there . Very friendly staff . This was my second , but definitely not my last time staying at this property . Every staff person I interact ##ed with had a can do attitude that starts with yes . This type of customer service is somewhat rare today . My room was out of site , ( clean , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , high tech , and just er ##gon ##omi ##cal ##ly comfortable ) just like my last stay . When I visit Chicago , this Hilton property is a must if its available . I have stayed at the Conrad in Chicago and Hong Kong . I highly recommend Conrad by Hilton to everyone . Its the best [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is quite nice , ideal ##ly placed in Chicago . the employees are court ##eous and make you fell Welcome . The Suite was great with the usual excellent So ##fit ##el bed ##ding and an excellent view . The only down ##side would be the bathroom , a half tub and an aging shower , not what you except in a " prestige suite " , this need to be renovated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful and in a pretty area across from the river . It is in great shape and very clean . The CO ##VI ##D protocols were above and beyond . The staff very friendly and helpful across the board . High ##ly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Value for money excellent - room was great for rest and work - bar service was extraordinary - the restaurant was good for breakfast and coffee / m ##uff ##ins , etc . - met many good and interesting people during the week primarily at the bat area . Location was superb - North avenue beach was minutes away as was the lake ##front plus easy to walk to clients and many outstanding restaurants / pubs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed a few times recently and this hotel does not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms , great lobby , super location , cool v ##ibe . What ' s not to like ? ! As in all other Kim ##pton hotel stays , the staff is un ##fa ##iling ##ly efficient and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room layout in one bedroom suites and large screen t ##v ' s . Excellent location for walking to Mill ##eni ##um Park , Macy ' s State Street , and Dale ##y Plaza ( Christ ##kind ##el ##market ) . Excellent food in restaurant and room service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , it was a good stay . I enjoy having the space of a living room separate from the bedroom and I enjoy having the kitchen ##ette . I thought the compliment ##ary breakfast and social hour was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , although the food was not super high quality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good professional service . Older hotel that has been beautifully updated . Large spacious lobby with bar and restaurant . Co ##m ##fort ##able stay . Excellent location to Metro , shopping and restaurants . Corner room offered view of Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel for people with Global ##ist status . Was upgraded to a great suite prior to arrival on the 28th floor , with awesome views of the river . Really love this area . Staff was great . Was allowed to spend $ 35 per day for breakfast , with all charges taken off due to the global ##ist status . Hotel could use an update , but definitely clean and well maintained [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the O ##m ##ni hotel on Michigan Ave this past weekend and was not disappointed ! All staff ( from bell persons , front desk , house ##keeping etc ) were very friendly and quick to greet guest while coming / going . Room was large and very clean . Con ##cier ##ge staff made great suggestions for restaurants and places to go . Would highly recommend this hotel and plan to come back when in Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not the best of hotel experiences . Staff not great . S ##light ##ly later check - out requested - " That ' ll be $ 50 " barked at me ( and this was after myself and six colleagues had stayed there all week ! ) . Room ##s not great either . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is showing some wear and needs to update ; No hot water during the visit We asked for a specific room which they gave us and sent us a card calling it the Swan ##son Room which was very nice ; The price for parking is getting too high [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was good . In walking distance to a lot of fun things to do and places to go . The sofa bed was not good at all but they did try to make it better with a foam mattress that they brought in . I will probably only stay here if I have 2 beds [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect ##ly located the Fair ##mont C ##ica ##go Millennium park is a beautiful hotel with an outstanding staff that will go out of their way to make you feel welcome . Upper floor rooms feature incredible views of the city and Lake Michigan [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second visit to Chicago and decided to stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand ! This was a great location with great staff . We had a small problem with our room but they treated like a big deal and went over and above to remedy the problem . Staff always had a smile and the free shuttle that ran downtown during the holiday season was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good , comfortable , clean property within walking distance of the " magnificent mile " . We had nice stay however they charge a resort fee , and I would not consider this a resort hotel anymore since they got rid of their pool . Also , v ##alet parking was full , so we had to self park . Too ##k quite a while to find a parking garage as the one right behind the hotel was full . I chose this hotel because it was family friendly , but without a pool anymore , the family friendly aspect is diminished a bit . I felt the property was good overall . Would stay again if I was there on business . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a business meeting and it was really good , great service , clean , not noisy . The only thing is the views , I had a sigh of a public parking . The hotel is super well located , block away for any tourist ##ic attraction [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best Location , they have a Star ##bu ##cks , which is easy for you if you don ’ t do big breakfast . They have a Michael Jordan ##s Restaurant , phenomena ##l . They ’ re rooms size its ok , their bathroom ##s were very neat and clean always . Their staff super nice ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] went to ch ##ica ##go on business nice hotel . great location . room was large two room suite . could have used a microwave or fridge in the room . had a k ##eur ##ig coffee maker . lots of screaming sire ##ns all night long . not the fault of the hotel room service dinner was well done [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ` s very nice hotel . The club rooms is amazing . The hotel location is excellent , walk distance for most of bench ##marks . The breakfast at Regency club was very nice . the river view is amazing . my family would like to return again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my second review of this hotel . we stayed here a couple years ago . Wen ##t to check in the week of the candy show early . Said it would be five hours at least . i expressed my disappointment because my husband would be gone and i just needed sleep . 20 minutes later I received a text from Josh at the front desk that my room was ready . Thanks Josh for hook ##ing me up . Everything at this hotel was top notch . Pi ##llow ##s and beds were so comfortable . I would love to know where to buy the pillows ? I want some . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This venue is is too expensive and too in ##con ##ven ##ient for attendees ( like me . . an older attend ##ee who just wants to attend the conference ) . The arrangements of conference rooms worked well enough for me . . . and the A ##V support was exceptional ( compared with other meeting setting ) . The support staff . . . in general were exceptional . . . friendly and they liked my jokes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very comfortable stay - everything was clean , the bed was comfortable , coffee / tea provided - but not the best value for the money charged . Not the friend ##liest staff at reception , and they told me incorrectly that breakfast was not included . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Park ##ing , continental breakfast , any items shipped to you , and almost everything else is an extra charge . I wish the shipping handling fee by the hotel was advertised . I ' ve never experienced a similar incident at another hotel , but I do fully admit that this is my first trip to Chicago in 20 years . I do not know if this is the norm in Chicago . Otherwise , the property is clean , the staff is extremely friendly and helpful . My room was very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a real charm , it is small and q ##ua ##int as are the rooms , and has a great finishes throughout particularly the bathroom ##s with quality fixtures and modern convenience ##s . The high quality barn door bathroom door created even more space . . . good thinking on their part . Nice ##ly placed plug ##s and quality bed accommodation ##s . The price I got was very competitive hence the five stars based on price vs value . If you are looking to stay on or around Michigan Ave , this is a well located property off the beaten path on the north end of the street . Not great for loop business , but on a nice day a beautiful walk down the street . Fitness center is adequate . Only knock is lack of free w ##if ##i which simply is not acceptable anymore , maybe even insulting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nicole T gave the B ##ES ##T front desk service . Super friendly and consider ##ate ! Wen ##t out of her way to accommodate me during my stay . Hotel is very nice and gym is great . Food it amazing . High ##ly recommend ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have two children ( ages 9 and 5 ) and we enjoyed our stay . The pool and hot tub were perfect because we could sit in the hot tub while the kids swam . Perfect setup . We loved the location of the hotel . Central to tons of shopping and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the fact that they have so many compliment ##ary items . If you forget anything it is almost a given that they will be able to provide it for you ! Staff was friendly . Love ##d the de ##cor and the happy hour ! Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located near the train station . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I liked this hotel very much . I don ' t like reviews and think a good person can have a bad day , and a bad person can have . I think this hotel was one of the best I have ever been in - top to bottom . D ##ON ' t Read any further . I have nothing more to write but the review has to be 200 characters - why ? : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel within walking distance of everything you could possibly wants . Room ##s were very clean and staff was helpful . Would love to stay again especially as a H ##ya ##tt member , appreciate ##s the extra per ##ks ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The small drop off area was packed and we basically had our car rear end hanging out in the street for 5 minutes . Also a 10 minute line to check in . And then was told I couldn ’ t check in because the reservation was under my husbands name , who was parking the car . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Ambassador East is a charming , soothing ##ly comfortable hotel in beautiful , Gold Coast Chicago . The staff are stellar , and totally re ##sp ##ons ##ive , going Beyond the call of duty , to every need and request . My wonderful stay is truly , ' Home Away From Home ' . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just checked in today , paying $ 300 a night , to find that one of the two elevators is not working . They are slow even when both are working ; to have one of them down on a busy holiday weekend can mean 10 - minute wait times for guests . Apparently this is not an emergency but rather routine maintenance , according to the sign posted on the elevator . For the prices this hotel is charging , this is just completely unacceptable . Hilton , you need to look at your management personnel on this property . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed ! I booked two upgraded rooms for the family . The rooms were not very clean dated and not well appointed run down . There is no turn down service . Pool is small slippery floor and uncomfortable seats . Food is okay at the hotel but service is slow and they got ##t the order wrong . I stay in Chicago often this hotel is not a good value but has a good location [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here with my wife on a quick weekend trip to Chicago and we were very pleased ! Located close to the " L " and within ##g walking distance to a lot of great food options + entertainment . The staff were very friendly and the complementary Happy Hour is always a plus ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I wish I would ' ve stayed the entire weekend at this g ##em in River North . Everything about this hotel is wonderful - the de ##cor , the rooms , the cocktail hour , the service , the compliment ##ary breakfast on each floor , and the amazing staff ! I had the pleasure of working with Melissa , and Gabriel , who both made my one - night experience un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble . If you ' re looking for a hotel in Chicago , this place will exceed your expectations in terms of location , service , and comfort ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing location . And may I say again , AM ##A ##Z ##ING L ##OC ##AT ##ION . My room de ##cor was wonderful . Love ##d the detail to customer service . I received an email before my trip to request my room accommodation preferences and if i wanted to include any tourist event packages / tickets with my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are quite dated although some claim they have been recently renovated . Book ##ed a room with a king bed but when we arrived at the hotel we could only get a room with two doubles . Had to pay $ 50 extra per night for a suite upgrade so I could sleep in the same bed as my wife [SEP]
1	[CLS] Modern bout ##ique hotel located within a block of the river just off State street . Well within walking distance of the vast majority of tourist ##y things you want to do in Chicago . Hotel has received a make ##over leaving it clean , class ##y and very modern . Am ##eni ##ties like continental breakfast on each floor , and the complementary free drink in their " bar " each night are great . The bar is not much for am ##bie ##nce but it does provide a good mixing place to meet other visitors to the city and exchange experiences . Staff is very helpful and friendly , always a smile on the faces of everyone we dealt with , would recommend this hotel highly to anyone trying to see the Chicago sites . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a delight to return to an old favorite and see that the H ##ya ##tt Regency has improved with the years . Great location , sweeping views , well - appointed rooms and excellent service and hospitality . Ku ##dos [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very beautiful , comfortable hotel . Staff were very warm and friendly . There isn ' t anything that could have been done to make me more happy to stay there . It exceeded my expectations . The beds were beyond comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We usually stay on Michigan Avenue and we love it ! ! ! However Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was a great surprise [UNK] adorable bout ##ique hotel just minutes from the Miracle Mile and central to many other Chicago g ##ems [UNK] the rooms were spacious and excellent . . . Great bathroom and nice city view . Every floor has a continental breakfast spread in the mornings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My girlfriend and I can ’ t get over how well the weekend went . From check - in at the So ##fit ##el to check - out our stay was great . The staff at the front desk , bar , and restaurant were pleasant . The amenities in the room were very nice . The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I ’ ve ever slept in in a hotel . Thank you So ##fit ##el [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nice hotel , bar was too crowded to even get in , but the breakfast restaurant was probably the best hotel breakfast I have had in the U . S . Beautiful choices and everyone in our party had amazing , great food ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Home ##wood Suite ##s has a great River North location . Close to everything . Great restaurants and shopping . Room ##s were clean , large and well equipped kitchen ##s . Very good breakfast ##s and evening light meals with beer and wine . Will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An excellent location and superb service . Great food with a very informed staff ! Places to visit were recommended along with tickets to purchase at the hotel . Both cab ##s and limo ##s are available to reach said locations . I went to the Field Museum , The Museum of Science and Industry then also went to the sky deck at the Sears Tower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for a weekend with the girlfriend ##s . Stay ##ed in a suite with a king bed in a room and a sleep ##er sofa in the living room with a full kitchen . The room was very nice , comfortable and clean . The kitchen just has a few basic supplies but it ' s not like you ' re going to do full scale cooking anyway . But there ' s enough there to get you though . Full refrigerator and nice bathroom . Friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , great location , easy to get there . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will book again [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 2 nights during the Cubs Convention . Room ##s were nice and clean , best shower ( hot water and pressure ) that I have had in a hotel . We went to the reception desk twice and both times dealt with Maria Claudio , she was very friendly and helpful . Overall a good experience and would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice , ups ##cale feel in the huge lobby areas . My room was a very small end of hallway location . Very quiet . , Co ##m ##fort ##able bed , tiny bathroom . T ##v had a red annoying line through it . I normally like a larger room but this served the purpose . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The fitness center was excellent , with a good range of well - maintained machines . But don ' t stay here if you expect a coffee / tea maker - I was cheerful ##ly told upon complaining that the majority of guests don ' t value them . The bathroom ##s aren ' t for the c ##laus ##tro ##phobic or those needing space to get in and out of a tub . Then there were the unpleasant smells wa ##fting from the sink . And prepare for a long wait to check in , although I ' ll con ##cede that this does provide time to enjoy the wonderful foyer . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was my first time in Chicago and it was a great location . You can walk everywhere and there are several places inside the hotel to eat . They had a free champagne night when I was there so that was a plus . Room ##s were big and clean . Staff was nice too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When checking in the room allocated was already occupied by someone else , when reporting back to reception there was no real apology , let alone the offer of getting someone to assist with luggage ! One of our party had no hot water the following day and when trying to call guest relations , no response to the telephone . The room was not serviced by 2 . 00 ##pm in the afternoon ! The telephone lines were not operative for a period of 24 hours . Very clean & comfortable [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has several amenities and is lovely . The weather was terrible but our trip was saved because of the amazing staff . Shaun at the front desk was extremely helpful . Katie and Timothy on the phones went above and beyond with every request we had ( we had several because we were stuck inside ) . Last ##ly , Connie in the Club Lounge was a mix ##ologist to say the least ! Dr ##ink ##s and food were great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed my brief stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l . Great location if you want access to the river walk , lake ##front and Michigan Avenue . Room ##s are very large and comfortable . Did not try the on ##site restaurant but it looked nice . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bad experience , booked a suite for 3 nights and the room I was assigned had a broken AC and a 3 ' by 4 ' section of the carpet was soaking wet . It took a total of 3 calls and 5 hours before both issues were taken care of . My request to have the manager contact also never happened . Lot ' s of other good hotel choices in the area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is the best place to feel co ##sy and well received . Staff is genuinely kind and looks happy to do their job . No fake , no up thighs , just noble care and kind approach . The location is a dream and the price is from far the best you can get around . There is a public parking next to it so you don < t have to pay the expensive v ##alet parking of the hotel . They have pet friendly rooms and they provide with dog beds and treats . The lobby is really nice and cool and you can comfortably sit there with your dog to have your meals . The restaurant have a nice menu . I recommend Monaco Chicago with great enthusiasm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lighting in the room ( s ) , was poor and inadequate . TV and controls were dated and difficult to navigate . I specifically asked not to have the room located by an ice machine . The ice machine was about ten feet away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located on Michigan Ave a few blocks east of red line grand station . Room ##s clean and extra toilet ##ries in bathroom . Star ##bu ##cks in lobby . Free bottles of drinking water on the room was very much appreciated . Only warning is shower was very difficult to t ##it ##rate between te ##pid and s ##cal ##ding hot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As far as location it really doesn ' t get any better than the Intercontinental . Steps to the best shopping and restaurants you could imagine ! The service was good , but not exceptional . The rooms were very small and basic but very clean and functional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad was an excellent choice for our recent stay . We chose a package that included parking which was a plus . All staff were extremely friendly , helpful and efficient . The room was amazing - very large and modern . Love have bottle ##d water at all times . Location was great . The only negative I could say is that I miss the lobby area of the former Conrad and being connected to Nord ##strom . Still , our stay was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is gorgeous and in the perfect location . However there are not nearly enough elevators for rooms , especially at night . The room service was phenomena ##l , as was the staff . We stayed in a del ##uxe suite which had plenty of space . Very clean and modern . I would stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed hotel stay here . Great location for walking to restaurants , River ##walk and Architectural Tours as well as Grant Park . Room ##s and hallway ##s quiet . Hotel service was excellent and the service people were all pleasant ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our long weekend at the Monaco . The location allowed for easy access to many of the attractions and the staff was very welcoming . The door ##men , especially , were so friendly and quick to offer directions or suggestions . We had a smaller room , without the window seats most of the reviews mention , but we were still quite happy with it as it was quiet and comfortable . Would stay again next time we ' re in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are large and bright with all modern amenities . P ##lent ##y of USB plug ##s and outlets , no family q ##ua ##rrel ##s about re ##cha ##rg ##ing . The beds are so comfortable , sheets are divine . Room was very clean and modern . The service was friendly , and clearly focused on serving our needs . We were all amazed at the way the So ##fit ##el made us feel that we were their priority guests . And the hotel was full ! We loved our stay , it made our gathering joy ##ful and amazing to gather in the lobby . We felt like we were at home , in a mansion ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is excellent : 5 ##min walk to the Millennium park , 5 ##min walk to Architecture river cruise tour , 15 ##min walk to 360 Chicago observation desk . There are plenty of restaurants nearby . Also there are restaurants in the hotel . Room ##s : I highly recommend you to choose river - view room : it really takes your attention . You ’ ll see sky ##scraper ##s , river and city life - it ’ s really cool . Bed and will ##ows are very comfortable , bathroom is big : there is shower cabin and bath both . W ##i - fi works excellent . Some information : Breakfast is not included - you should pay $ 50 per person . There is “ fast ” parking zone in front of the main door - you can stop there for taking your luggage from the car and that ’ s it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was really pleased with my room allocation here as generally I find that as a woman traveling alone I seem to get the smallest room in the worst spot . I had lovely views of the lake and the room was spacious and comfortable - my only issue is that as a stock market trader I need good W ##i ##F ##i and every time I used a VP ##N block ##er on my i ##Pad , which I need to trade , the W ##i ##F ##i stopped working . I also got no cell signal from my room so I spent a lot of time in the elevator going to the lobby ! I asked at reception and they sent an engineer up to my room - who looked per ##plex ##ed to have been sent to sort a W ##i ##F ##i issue . It ’ s a nice place but I was glad to move after two nights to a bout ##ique hotel with great connectivity and a more hands on staff approach . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic location & accommodation ##s . Very clean and spacious room , easy access to shopping and entertainment , and bonus breakfast with very nice variety . Will be back again next time our family visits Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room ! The property is very clean and staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The location is excellent . We were able to enjoy the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Water ##tower Place , and more with energy left over . My granddaughter ##s thoroughly enjoyed our stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Love ##ly stay at the Fair ##mont but mostly , I ' m incredibly app ##re ##cia ##tive of Elizabeth who works in the restaurant . She waited on me a few times , realized I was sick and made sure I had an ample supply of hot tea , lemon and honey so I could try and get well enough to give a presentation I was in Chicago to give . It worked . Hotels amenities are great , but it ' s the people that really create the experience . Ku ##dos to Elizabeth and to a culture that allows people to be great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything about this hotel is great . The staff at the hotel was very at ##ten ##tive - they even greeted me by name each time I entered and left the building . The room was nice , and the flat screen TV was one of the largest I ' ve seen in any hotel room . I highly recommend dinner at their restaurant , Baptiste & Bo ##ttle ( the Am ##ish Chicken was delicious ! ) There is a standard of service achieved here that far eclipse ##s most U . S . hotels I ' ve stayed at in my life . If business sends me back to Chicago again , this will definitely be my top choice for accommodation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I traveled to Chicago for a weekend get - away to take in the sights of the city with my family . The hotel was very inviting from the first minute . The bell staff were right there to help with our bags and v ##alet our car . I was early for check in and was hoping to leave my bags until later and was pleasant ##ly surprised to be told I could check in right away . The front desk agent was so friendly , the house ##keeping staff very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and they even had a continental breakfast ! Everything about this hotel was amazing , definitely a place to go back to ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a Kim ##pton gal and this is my go to locally . I have stayed here more than 30 times in the last 10 years - just recently saw a review I did on this in 2007 for my now fi ##an ##cé ' s 30th b ##day - we stayed here again for his 40th b ##day as well . You can get some great pricing at this hotel - recently had a 99 rate for IL residents . You can get a small room sometimes , but always well appointed . I don ' t v ##alet as that costs 65 / night and instead use Park ##ing ##W ##iz and normally find a spot on the weekend for 15 for the night within walking distance . The Lt ##rain is nearby on wells so you may hear it at night , so be aware if you are a light sleep ##er . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was impressed by the service and facilities at Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago . I was welcomed warmly and my luggage was delivered in record time ! It ' s convenient to numerous restaurants . The pool is beautiful and large , with that area decorated in vintage style . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is amazing to spend time in Chicago . The one bedroom suite is very spacious and beautiful like photos . Especially Kay and Wayne were so helpful and made my day : ) Me and my family truly had amazing time here and will definitely come back : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent five night at this property and had a wonderful stay . All the staff we encountered were amazing , friendly , at ##ten ##tive to ones needs and always willing to go above and beyond . We were Gold level and the lounge staff was super always friendly and wanting to make sure our stay was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good for business or pleasure . In downtown and very close to all main tourist attractions . Also good restaurants and parks nearby . Ask for lakes ##ide view room which has excellent view of River Walk and the Centennial Wheel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing history with this large , grand hotel . Was here for a conference , and the conference facilities were great . The location is excellent . En ##joy ##ed staying at this large , impressive hotel as a change , though as might be expected the rooms were somewhat out ##dated . I had a little trouble getting the room to desired temperature and the internet was poor at times . Also really dislike having to pay extra for internet in your room . In general I had a fantastic time at this hotel , but probably wouldn ' t have chosen it if it weren ' t for the conference . There are likely cheaper , more comfortable , more intimate options now in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m a fan of the So ##fit ##el hotels , so it was obvious for me to stay there while in Chicago . The hotel is well located , the rooms are big enough , spacious , clean , with great lighting and all the necessary equipment . The bathroom is very spacious too . The room service is really fast . The room service was really effective . The con ##cier ##ge was amazing , he advised us on all the activities we asked him about , proposed some great restaurants and booked everything for us . I will definitely stay there again if I come back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome location . Located In the Gold Coast area so it ’ s tucked away in a quiet residential area but walking distance to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Our room looked just like the pictures . Very clean , comfortable , bright and spacious ( especially the closet ) Our check in went smoothly & they even let us check in an hour early . Keep in mind the mini fridge is filled with items so you won ’ t have a place to keep left ##overs if you were planning on it . C ##VS , Star ##bu ##cks , Lou Mal ##nat ##i ’ s Has ##h House a Go - Go , Velvet Ta ##co are just a couple of the places that are 5 - 10 min walk away . High ##ly Re ##com ##men ##d ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our room was beautiful , and we had a fantastic view . Everything was clean , modern , and well decorated . The staff was all very friendly and helpful too ! They immediately resolved any problems , as well as were always on top of things like room service and cleaning . I would definitely recommend this to a friend ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] always enjoy staying at the H ##ya ##tt Regency . The staff is amazing ! The rooms are very comfortable . Food choices were limited on site , but just a block or so way there ' s a wide variety of choices for lunch . ( Not dinner ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile Hotel . Our room , the hotel restaurant , service and location were fantastic . The staff at the hotel were excellent and did one of the best jobs of making us feel very welcomed at the hotel . They provided a welcome drink and and the restaurant gave us a welcome glass of champagne . We have been to Chicago many time and this was our best hotel experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here recently and absolutely loved this place ! Got an incredible deal by booking months in advance and by en ##roll ##ing in their loyalty program . Location is excellent and the rooms were top notch ! You will not be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always love staying at the O ##m ##ni Chicago . Service is outstanding , the location is superb and the suites are amazing . If you have a family this hotel is ideal in that all the rooms are 1 bedroom suites . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , could use a little up ##grading . We could walk to several restaurants and shopping . Staff are very friendly , good service . Would stay there again . Room ##s are also little small , but we were upgraded to a larger one , no charge , which was nice . There is a small restaurant for breakfast , a little price ##y for what you get . Close to International House of Pan ##cakes which is a good place to eat , not costly . Overall , it was a pleasant stay , would recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great staff and location . There is construction going . on outside but I did not hear any noise from it . I had a great upgraded corner room . The exercise room was good . The bar area and wine reception are a reason to stay here alone [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff constantly checked with me to make sure my stay was awesome . Love Hotel All ##egro . They do a great job reaching out through their text app to check - in with me . 312 also had a great selection of beer . It was nice I did not have to leave hotel to get something to eat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wife and I checked in for a short get ##away . We ' ve stayed here numerous times and have never been disappointed . Excellent location and delicious breakfast ! The staff always puts in 120 % effort to make is feel at home . Over ##night v ##alet parking is $ 73 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Palmer House is an historic hotel with an elegant lobby that convey ##s an old world el ##egan ##ce . Staff were generally friendly and helpful . The rooms were relatively standard issue and did not live up to the standard of el ##egan ##ce in the lobby . . There was a mini fridge in the room for the over ##p ##rice ##d hotel beverages , but no space for any other food . The fitness center was well equipped , but the pool and hot tub were closed for renovations and will be for several months . The setting for afternoon tea was delight ##ful , but the food was me ##dio ##cre and over ##p ##rice ##d . The location is excellent - just a few minutes from the Art Institute and the Cultural Center . It was a pleasant stay overall . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I enjoyed the hotel itself , just don ' t interact with the staff . They were less than pleasant . The room was clean and the cleaning people did great about cleaning our room . The br ##eas ##k ##fast was the same daily , but I will not count that as a c ##rit ##ism . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary dinner and drinks is only Mon - T ##hur ##s . We thought it was all week , but again understand ##able . Only down side were the unpleasant staff . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We live in the Chicago suburbs and choose the All ##egro for our two night stay in the city as it was walking distance from O ##gi ##l ##vie Transportation Center . Check in could not have been any more pleasant . David greeted us with so much warmth . He made us instantly feel at home . Sandy was also lovely and persona ##ble . We arrived at 2 : 00 and there was no problem checking in . The lobby was decorated absolutely perfectly for the holidays . Very class ##y ! Coffee , hot chocolate , tea is available during the day in the lobby and 5 : 00 prose ##cco is an added bonus . Our room was very comfortable and the huge closet had a yoga mat , two bath ##robe ##s , and a huge umbrella . Overall we highly recommend the Hotel All ##egro . . . . their staff is number 1 ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you want to experience a world class hotel in down ##time Chicago , IL - The Conrad Hotel is the place for you . You and you partner or even a girls weekend - you will enjoy the look and feel of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel . Great location three blocks from the waterfront . P ##lent ##y of great restaurants close by and a great one the P ##ump Room on premises . Ask for the Frank Sinatra table . The guest services manager Travis could not have been more helpful and the staff was very friendly . And very comfortable beds ! Looking forward to coming back to the Ambassador . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My mother , sister , and daughter and I met and stayed in Chicago this past weekend , and - - while we didn ' t stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker - - Si ##me ##on from the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker was amazing ##ly helpful ! When the cold water pipes at our hotel went out and stayed out for over twelve hours , we inquired about rooms at The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . Si ##me ##on was extremely kind and offered us two rooms at a great rate ! In addition , he even escorted us up to the rooms ( at 11 ##pm ! ) so that we felt comfortable before making the reservation . To make a long story short , we ultimately did not need to book the reservation as the cold water was restored around 11 : 30 ##pm , but Si ##me ##on was so kind and patient and went above and beyond his duties that I felt compelled to write a review . Thanks , Si ##me ##on ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in this hotel a few times for business . It ' s a nice hotel that ' s located downtown and is in walking distance of just about everything . Millennium Park and Cloud ##gate are right across the street , the river and lake are a short walk , and there are a million places to eat close by . The hotel itself had clean rooms both times I stayed there and the staff was friendly . The rooms were a bit price ##y . There is a bar located on the main level . I wouldn ' t hesitate to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , but during our off - season visit , we found ourselves limited to when we could use the on - site bar and restaurant . we went 0 - 2 trying to get dinner and then later at midnight , the bar was closed early . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is nearby so many activities . Perfect for our conference which was located at the hotel . Everyone was so nice and helpful . Their friendly faces made me feel right at home . The Fair ##mont Gold room is a M ##US ##T add - on to your stay . The food and drinks are perfect ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our first visit to the Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago was exceptional in every way . From check - in to check - out the staff could not have been more helpful nor the surroundings more comfortable . My wife threatened to buy the pillows from the hotel because she found them so incredibly comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room we stayed in was a little small but this is due to us choosing for four friends to stay together . The hotel is central ##ly located and the staff could not have been more helpful during our stay . When there was no safe in the room they held our valuable ##s for us in their safe and they even set up free W ##i ##F ##i for us even though it didn ’ t come with a package with our room . Would highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We simply loved it ! The hotel is in the magnificent mile , it ' s clean and beautiful . The service was great , the food at the restaurant was delicious . We had a great time there , we def ##ini ##tley recommend the Mill ##eni ##um K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can ’ t say enough about the friendly staff and outstanding customer service we received during our stay . They truly went above and beyond making it a wonderful experience ! Fantastic location close to everything . Great hotel , great value ! Will definitely be our hotel of choice when staying in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was over spring break . T ##H ##e hotel was ##ver ##y nice , lots of families , many kids and yet the hotel staff dealt with them very well . Hall ##s were quite , pool was jumping . Breakfast was manned and went very smoothly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago was our hotel for Star Wars Celebration 2019 . The room was fine . It provided a nice resting place for us , however and I ' m not sure if this in On ##P ##eak ' s fault or not . I wish it would have been more clear that internet in the room was not free . It was $ 15 per day . We didn ' t get it . The lobby is free . Also , their fridge charges for you to use it to store your own things . That kind of sucks , but oh well . All of the staff we encountered were great . It ' s a nice hotel . We didn ' t eat there , so I can ' t comment on the food . We did use the Star ##bu ##cks . PA ##R ##K ##ING T ##IP : Use Park ##W ##hi ##z . We purchased parking at Ogden Plaza G ##ara ##ge , which is actually connected to the hotel . It was much cheaper to buy in advance . We printed the ticket and had zero issues . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying at the Conrad . And it won ##t be the last ! ! ! The location of the hotel is perfect to take a nice walk on Michigan Ave or down to the Navy Pier . The Staff is wonderful ! Everyone was very professional , super friendly and helpful in any way ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nice ##st staff ever ! Everyone went above and beyond to make out stay pleasant ! Had two rooms with my older grand ##ki ##ds and their mothers and we were treated like royalty ! 5 star hotels don ' t have this kind of service ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] To cool your room at night the hotel recommend ##s you open the windows because the H ##VA ##C has not been " switched " over for cooling . Two problems with this 1 . bugs will fly in your room at night while you are trying to sleep because they have no screens on the windows . 2 . Noise pollution from downtown cars and emergency vehicles all night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Other than the location , I would not recommend staying here . The A / C is our room was noisy ( but rarely produced cool air ) and the beds were very uncomfortable . Broken doors , broken toilet , incredibly slow elevators - the list goes on . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Old school architecture with history and character dating back to 1927 mix sea ##m ##lessly with modern flare and amenities . I felt like a sophisticated Mad Man in town on business . The service is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble in the 720 South restaurant . S ##light ##est problem with my app ##eti ##zer and the staff fixed it right away , com ##ped dessert , and didn ’ t make me feel like a jerk for sending it back . The pot belly flat ##bre ##ad and Burr ##ata c ##ros ##tin ##i were delicious . P ##ric ##ing for this hotel and the amenities is extremely reasonable based on the quality and level of service . I ’ m an honors member now because of this trip , unfortunately I couldn ’ t figure out how to use my honors profile though . I will definitely book this hotel for future stays . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a g ##em ! Perfect location . Staff are very friendly and helpful . Room ##s are nice . Car ##pet is new . Room has coffee machine and fridge . Breakfast every morning outside your room . Close to restaurants . We took a cab to the United Center for a concert . $ 12 . 00 . Vale ##t is expensive if you can park in parking garage around the corner . De ##fin ##ately would stay here again ! Got a good rate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel . Dec ##ent food in restaurant and bar . G ##rat customer service . TO ##TA ##LL ##Y disappointed in go into the hot tub at 9 ##pm to find about ten 8 - 10 year - olds in the hot tub on a Friday night . It def ##lated our night , big time . The ##te were about 6 if us who wanted to get in and they were not m ##oo ##ching even with the adults overseeing the situation . Not cool . Said something and nothing was done . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay ! Clean hotel . The staff was amazing , very polite and friendly . Great location for shopping . Good price . Free coffee in the lobby / ran out and they replaced right away ! Stay here ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Intercontinental Chicago staff ex ##udes warmth and hospitality . To borrow a phrase from a popular restaurant chain , when you ' re here , you ' re family . E ##ff ##icient check - in . Very comfortable and quiet room , under ##state ##d el ##egan ##ce Sub ##tle yet helpful staff for guest needs . The fairly new Intercontinental " destination fee " is a minor irritation , yet the industry seems determined to e ##ek out extra dollars . Super convenient location , easy access to all of what we needed and wanted . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Second time to stay in a Hotel Monaco . Great customer service , but . . . - have to go downstairs to get morning coffee - coffee isn ' t good . Saw several people coming in with Star ##bu ##cks after walking several blocks to buy it . Finally I asked one man and he confirmed that the hotel ' s coffee wasn ' t very good . - hot water for tea wasn ' t hot . My sweet husband brought some up to the room , but the tea bag would not work - out of English Breakfast tea . They said they get it from their restaurant and when the restaurant is out they have to order it which takes 2 to 3 days ! - bathroom don ' t have any place to keep your toilet ##ries except on the counter next to the sink . These in ##con ##ven ##ience ##s can be easily re ##med ##ied . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my new favorite Chicago hotel . It ' s a short walk from Oak Street Beach , Michigan Ave , Lincoln Park , and Old Town restaurants . It was so convenient having a late dinner at Booth One the night we got in . Every staff member was wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall great hotel in every way : superb welcome , great rooms , super service , dining in 312 Chicago worked really well . Total ##ly recommended . Special k ##udo ##s to Cassie W on Re ##ception : a great ambassador for the hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel with a lot of space . My room was very nice ( two full ##s ) . The only down ##side to the room was that there was no microwave and even though I was on the 11th floor , I could still hear the annoying sounds of Chicago traffic . I would highly re ##come ##nd this hotel , but maybe try to stay a few floors higher . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is one of the oldest hotels in Chicago , but by no means out ##dated . The Palmer House has a very rich history ; the original owner of the hotel had it build for his bride among other stories . We went on several tours in Chicago and they all mentioned bits and pieces of this hotel ' s past . The lobby is on the 2nd floor and the ceilings are breath ##taking , I felt like I was in Europe . Like chocolate ? Another great reason to stay here , the brown ##ie was born here . The service was exception , it was a real treat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited this weekend during several large events with the hotel in sold out capacity . The staff were professional and court ##eous . The room ( an upgrade ) was spacious well , furnished and functional . The gym was 24 h ##rs as well as well equipped and spacious . The location for our event was perfect . Room service was a mixed bag . Con ##sist ##ently good food , reasonable price and nice staff . The menu was limited and had funny hours limitations . When sold out the hotel had delays for services which I brought to the attention of the management . Overall the stay was good and would recommend to all with business in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel in a great location . Room was fantastic with one of the most comfortable beds in all my travels . The bedroom t ##v was at a bad angle . Nice living are with desk . Nice bathroom ##s . Two big distraction ##s , , , , no free W ##i ##F ##i and a room at this cost should have a walk - in shower . I would still stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Hotel : Location Great ( Michigan Avenue , adjacent to Michigan Lake ) . Executive Room ( floor 25 ) very quiet , well equipped with Tea , Coffee facilities , etc . Very pleasant staff . Check - out Re ##ception ##ist Cars ##arra was extremely helpful and polite a pleasure to be helped by her today - thank you ! Leisure facilities good . Restaurant facilities good . Would stay again for sure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Not impressed . The hotel lobby was beautiful , no doubt . We paid to be on the executive level . Our room was giant , so I cannot understand why the 2 double beds rather than queen ##s ? Weird . and although we weren ’ t there to watch TV , i do watch before bed but this television was so far across the room that we had to turn our heads all the way to see it . Weird . We called maintenance as the sink in One of our bathroom ##s would not drain . They never came . So we had to c ##ram in 1 tiny bathroom . Don ’ t waste your money to pay extra for ex ##ec floor . Per ##ks aren ’ t worth it . We stay in Hilton ’ s all the time and this one just didn ’ t do it for me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed two nights at this hotel , and found it to be an excellent location and value . The building itself is a classic , the rooms are traditional and nice . They have a happy hour every night at 5 pm . Best of all for me was that it was within blocks of the train , and I was able to rent a car for the day in the neighborhood as well . Very easy to set up shop for business across the Chicago area , with nice restaurants and the river in walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] stayed here last year and was impressed , stayed here for a second time this past week and there was no change . excellent customer service , great location , big rooms , awesome hotel all around . special shout out to ch ##ris to made sure the stay was great ! will definitely come back again . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this hotel for our meeting for the last 7 years . The accommodation ##s have always been pleasant . The staff is always very helpful . The renovation of the hotel is great . High ##ly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel Friendly and welcoming staff - Great location - straight onto The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile - Near 66 Bus to bring you to the Navy Pier and close to all the nice shops . Very good would stay there when I am next in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Annual birthday trip . From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special . From Malcolm , who checked us in , to Will , best bell hop ever . We will be back . Thanks for making this a birthday to remember . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable , excellent location ! Chi ##c , modern , and clean . The staff were very helpful and court ##eous . Total ##ly recommended this establishment and will definitely book here again if I want to stay downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was convenient ##ly located in downtown Chicago . We were able to walk almost everywhere or take the train . Staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and were willing to help with all our needs . The only negative thing that I have to say is that the check in process was very slow . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice room . Came with s ##ham ##po ##o , condition ##er and hair dry ##er . Wide ch ##ais ##e . P ##lent ##y of outlets . There is a luggage check which is convenient . And now I think I will just ram ##ble on til I reach the 200 character min . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for the Ireland V All Blacks rugby game in November . The hotel was convenient ##ly located right across the road from The Emerald Loop , a fun spot . Our room was small ##ish but completely met our needs . Nice comfortable bed , and lovely toilet ##ries . The location was perfect - poised in between The Loop and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Front desk staff were friendly and helpful . The attached bar / restaurant was fantastic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were heading to a concert at the Aragon ballroom and decided to try this hotel out . Fantastic , great service , clean rooms and very modern . Low beds but overall very comfortable . Located greatly near 3 arts cafe . Nice bar downstairs and breakfast was semi self service . All in all a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I checked in , i have two confirmation due to earlier arrival and showed them my two confirmed number , however it was only handled 1st confirmation and the next day I have to re - check in my room because access key was expired and new clerk ##s does not know what to do and asked man ##ger to have confirmation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one night , loved the location of this hotel : close to parks , navy pier , restaurants , great to walk around , tour the 2nd city in leisure . The staff ##s are very friendly , shot out to Hussein and Eva . The room is good size with all the usual amenities , only complaint is that there is only one garbage bin , a very small one at that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the 5th hotel that I ’ ve stayed at over the last few years , and it was my favorite . It ’ s on a relatively quiet area but within walking distance of some good restaurants and sights ##ee ##ing attractions . The rooms were clean , comfortable and quite spacious . The lobby area on the first f ##oo ##or is quiet . The check in desk is upstairs and the restaurant is adjacent to it , but isn ’ t too loud . The cleaning staff were excellent . Room service was pro ##mpt as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a wonderful stay at this hotel . The room was very clean and the staff was great . The conference was very well run and the bathroom ##s were also kept very clean . I look forward to staying here again for our next conference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 2 nights for a conference at the hotel . The waiting staff and food at the conference were really great . Had room service one night and again great service . I was on the 36th floor with an a great view over the park and lake . My bed was com ##fy and lovely pillows , with a great shower and bathroom - a huge room . However furniture was a bit dated in places . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve been to Chicago several times and this was my first stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l but definitely not my last . We were given a room with an awesome view of the river and Navy Pier . The location was very convenient with many sites / restaurants within walking distance . I was there for a conference with my professional association and the conference facilities were excellent . I was especially impressed with the staff - the room attendant ##s , the bar staff , the door ##men and v ##alet ##s - all were professional and friendly . Special shout - out to J ##ac ##lyn Costello who checked us in on the first day and greeted us several times during our entire stay - she was extremely helpful and engaging . Looking forward to the opportunity for a return trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Vale ##t guy Man ##ard , Top guy very helpful , very welcoming . Very nice hotel , walking distance to a lot of things , food was great would recommend and the price was very cheap for a downtown hotel in Chicago [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is incredible ! It has a historic feel but is super clean and gorgeous . We had our wedding here and can ' t recommend Paige enough to help book and plan your event . The staff is amazing and highly recommend this hotel . Great location and food too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Several people made my visit amazing this last weekend . Michael at the la ##tte bar in the morning was charming and went way out of his way to accommodate us ! Ki ##a in reservations was a delight who helped fix a bill ##ing error ( that I made ) . I was even allowed a late check out as well , which made a huge difference in my day to finish up a project in my room . Beautiful river views from my room with a reasonable rate . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Came to the city to see Hamilton with my family and wanted a nice place to stay . Everything about the hotel was fantastic from the staff , food , clean ##liness , etc . If I had to have any complaint it would be that there was no swimming pool and I think some of the food prices were high . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is was really nice . The staff was amazing , they were so helpful in checking us on and with questions I had throughout the weekend . Our room was not huge , but I was not expecting a massive space . It was clean and had everything we needed . We were here to explore Chicago . Our flight had got in an hour late so we missed their happy hour the first night , but it goes everyday so I was able to check it out on Saturday evening . Pretty cool setup and they had a ton of drinks . The place was packed as well so glad I got to check that out . The location is great , either jump in a cab or walk we got to everything in minutes . For the most part we were out but I would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed on Sept . 26 - 27 , 2018 . Both morning there were union members out front making such a loud rack ##et that we couldn ' t think , let alone sleep . They were protesting their lack of a contract . Until this problem is resolved , do not stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Right on the river with fantastic views - definitely get a river view room . Hotel is H ##U ##GE with lots of tour groups , but i asked for a quiet room and definitely got one . Room ##s are good size with comfortable beds . Bath ##rooms are a bit dated but very big with huge sink and van ##ity . Short walk to Michigan Avenue , Millennium Park , Cloud ##G ##ate , Art Institute , the loop - pretty much everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for ten nights on my first ever trip to Chicago . The location right on Michigan Avenue is nothing but fantastic ! The shopping is out of this world , Louis V ##uit ##ton , Chan ##el & B ##ur ##berry just a two minute walk from the hotel . The John Hancock building is right next door as Is the Ch ##eese ##cake Factory ! The hotel itself is simply stunning ! I had a small room which was perfect for my needs . The hotel staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them . If I ever came back to Chicago I would definitely re ##book this hotel again . Thank you K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker & thank you Chicago for looking after this single British travel ##ler . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel felt extremely welcoming and co ##zy despite its size . I encountered a number of team members who genuinely seemed eager to help . I had not been to the hotel in a long time and was impressed with the upgrades . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I saw my room , it was heavenly ! Picture a warm , inviting , co ##zy environment with decade ##nt food and drink with a friendly staff . You are at the Ambassador . Great location and first class service . Fire ##place and plenty of amenities offered to make your stay memorable . I loved my five days stay and will be back on my next trip . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' m an un ##ash ##amed hotel s ##nob and I booked this room for my 35th birthday weekend . It did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! The hotel and room is modern , exquisite ##ly appointed , and quiet . The staff was friendly , and professional , and not in a forced way . My only regret is that I part ##ied so hard , I didn ' t get to be in the room and enjoy it more . I definitely will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel in a great location . We walked everywhere and it was located right in the heart of the action . Easy check - in and lovely room . Upon leaving , we left our bag with bell captain and it was again very easy . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was perfect for our family vacation to Chicago ! We could walk to everything we wanted to do , there were great restaurants and stored nearby , there was a pool and we had a fantastic view ! We will stay here again when we come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great customer service and wonderful trip . The staff were very respect ##ful and gave wonderful re ##cco ##men ##dation ##s of Chicago . I would absolutely stay here again . Very clean hotel . Bath ##rooms were a little small but as to be expected for the City . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for two nights on the 9th floor looking west at the river . The view was fantastic , complement ##ing the quality of the room . The bed was quite comfortable , and everything you ' d expect was there . Overall , it ' s not too much different than when I first stayed here 20 years ago . But it was clean , the carpet ##s were new , and the service was efficient . We ' ll definitely stay here again next time we come down from the b ##ur ##bs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve been a Hilton Diamond member for many years and this is hands - down one of the best Hilton properties I ' ve ever visited . The room was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . . . clean and with g ##ad ##gets ( but not over the top ) . The staff was outstanding . . . extremely friendly and helpful . And last ##ly , we ' ve all been to chain hotels that have very me ##dio ##cre restaurants and bars . Not the case here . The rooftop su ##shi restaurant / bar was te ##rri ##fic . Great view and more of a grown - up crowd vs club crowd often seen at places like this . The b ##our ##bon bar had a great selection and the ground - level Italian restaurant had a very inviting v ##ibe from the street . One block off Michigan Ave means it ' s quiet , but close to plenty of restaurants and shopping . Great place . . . I can ' t wait to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They use the washing machine just for one glass or the pot of coffee ! I suggested to wait until I left the hotel and have everything cleaned , or I will manually clean my glass when I decide . The toilets leak . . . I can ' t imagine all the hotels working like this , not caring about waste of water and energy . Sad [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this hotel based on location and the quantity of walk ##able attractions we were visiting . Beat ##ing able to walk through the park to lakes ##hore trail , then shopping , then theater , and of course the art museum was key for us . We loved the views from our room and how large it was . The upgrade to access the gold lounge was so worth it ! Fresh breakfast b ##uff ##et , evening app ##eti ##zers and dessert ##s and the great staff : Mu ##gi , T ##ip ##hani , Mad ##ana , Henry ( great historical knowledge ) . We would stay again and have recommended you to friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a completely fine stay at the s ##wi ##sso ##tel . Nice views of river . Clean and modern rooms . Nothing bad nothing incredible - basically what you would expect for a nice ##r hotel . But the elevators are bizarre . You call the elevator with your floor number on the outside . No buttons except to close the doors inside the elevators . Couldn ’ t get use to it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We reserved one suite for a week at the Homes ##uit ##es Hotel by Hilton . The hotel is situated in the heart of the city . The room was a bit small but nice and clean , a laundry room for the guests is available on the floor which makes life a lot easier . The breakfast is compliment ##ary as well as an early evening social event with food and drinks from Monday to Thursday . The personnel was very gentle and helpful . If I can give a suggestion to improve , a safe box in the room would be a good addition and a better variety of food for breakfast would also be a smart move . All together we were very happy with our choice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ing in took at least 20 minutes ( with no waiting time behind other guests checking in ) for a room booked direct with Fair ##mont Hotels was not acceptable after a long flight from Australia and taxi to the hotel in Chicago ' s afternoon traffic ! The room was satisfactory but the bed surround was in a poor state with vinyl p ##eel ##ing off . On our return to Chicago we stayed at an alternative hotel where the check in was quick and efficient and the room considerably bigger than the Fair ##mont room at less than half the cost . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This room was part of a package for a weekend event . When we checked in our bathroom smelled like cigarette smoke and there was dirty socks and underwear in one of our drawers . Security came and removed the items and the operator offered to get the room re - cleaned . Later when we returned the linen was left outside our door until the next afternoon . On our last morning we found a LA ##R ##GE cock ##roach in our bathroom and checked out immediately - G ##RO ##SS The staff were nice and seemed to want to fix the problems , but the lack of clean ##liness seems to be ins ##ur ##mount ##able given the size of the cock ##roach that actually moved the glass we trapped it under . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was very pleasant . The staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and professional . Some of the amenities in our room were a bit awkward , the coffee maker was in a cabinet and the only place to put it was on the desk , which was not really convenient for a business travel ##er using the desk . Additionally , while we did not use the mini ##bar / fridge , we wish there had been a mini fridge for us to store our own restaurant left ##overs and water bottles for our days in and out for business meetings . There was also no way to buy water , we had to run to the over ##p ##rice ##d grocery store down the street . A mini - fridge would have been convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 1 night between an Amtrak trip and a flight home . This location was convenient . We had a comfortable and spacious room at a reasonable price . The view overlooked the Chicago River and we were able to walk along the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile during our short stay . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] One of my favorite hotels in the Chicago area , the design is gorgeous and the rooms are quiet and comfortable . The fitness center has a wide variety of options including a P ##elo ##ton bike which was fun to try . Also any hotel with a Pro ##se ##cco hour every night is a winner in my book . High ##ly recommend this hotel to those coming to Chicago for work or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located property with excellent service and lunch restaurant . S ##hy away from breakfast : it was ok , with dishes off in flavor ( all had same oil ##y taste ) . Beyond that very nice rooms and easy access to Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a few nights last week , I thoroughly enjoyed my stay . The hotel is in a brilliant location , , 4 minute walk away from a mall and surrounded by small stores to go grab a snack and drink . Room was a nice size with a mini fridge and iron ##ing facilities . Room was very clean and so was the hotel lobby when I arrived ! Staff were all brilliant at the hotel , especially David who works outside ! Was very helpful with directions and was always happy to have a chat ! Will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice older property . Excellent service and food . Walking distance to many local attractions . The pool is very cool ! ! Many interesting architectural touches make this a fun place . My only complaint is H ##VA ##C noise in the room at night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton All ##egro is located in a very central location which makes it easy to get anywhere you may want to visit . The Chicago theater is within walking distance as is Garrett ' s Go ##ur ##met Pop ##corn . There is a train station around the corner to aid in touring the city . All ##egro ' s staff is very friendly and helpful . The hotel offers AM coffee and PM Pro ##se ##cco both of which are located in the lobby . The de ##cor is a bit dark for my taste but the beds are super comfortable . 312 is the restaurant located in the hotel . It is accessible through the hotel or from the outside . The food and wait staff , equally , are wonderful ! The f ##rit ##tata was a very good start to my day and the salmon was the perfect ending . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great accommodation ##s , great service . The location was perfect - within a couple of blocks of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and other sites of interest . Couldn ' t have asked for a better experience . I ' ll return on my next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We attended a wedding in Chicago and this hotel was one of two picked by the bride and groom . What an excellent choice ! It ' s a small and perfect ! We were greeted by the most friendly and wonderful door ##man ! No focus of the front desk , it was around the corner in a small no ##ok . Small lounge for drinks and food and private room with fireplace to sit and relax . We were upgraded to a suite and it was H ##U ##GE ! The beds were wonderful as were the linen ##s . Bath ##room was large and even had a j ##ac ##uz ##zi / shower ! The rooms finishes were taste ##ful and not beat up like many hotels are . It ' s close the the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! Lots of places to eat or have cocktail ##s . Close to W ##al ##green ##s and a little market to pick up snack ##s and adult beverages : ) I definitely recommend this property ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came with my whole family and reserved a total of six rooms . My check in was late for over an hour , we waited in the lobby until 4 ##ish pm , and the room they gave me was not what in the category we reserved . Half the size of the others in our reservation . We had a total of $ 20 per day , per room to spend inside the hotel with food and beverage . In the check ##out , they forgot to de ##duct this credit and forced us to pay the whole thing . Room ##s there are not cheap , but they keep trying to get c ##rum ##bled from you . Even though we were all in the executive floors , they charged us to use the gym . They even wanted to charge to open a wine bottle in the room or to lend us a wine opener . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not coming back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel and friendly staff ! Fun bar atmosphere . Excellent food and specialty cocktail ##s . Solid wine selection . D ##wayne is a really outgoing staff member . The v ##alet took good care of my car - which is always a worry when you are leaving your car downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with my Girl ##friend In March . We were touring around Chicago and also went to Chicago Black ##H ##aw ##ks game . The pool on the 42nd floor was nice , it had a very pretty view of Chicago . The Hot tub was cold and Dirty . Plus it was over 50 dollars a night to park here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a conference . I thought all of the staff were very friendly . The rooms are nice enough , although the hotel feels somewhat dated . There are some areas that look more recently renovated , while others are older . All in all , I was happy for a larger conference - style hotel . The hotel is in a great location for access ##ing sights in the Loop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service . The team went out of their way to ins ##ure our comfort and convenience . Hotel is located a few blocks from the Michigan Mile . We needed extra pillows and help to get the TV working . Help was provided with a smile and ex ##ped ##iti ##ously . Breakfast was a bit price ##y ( $ 20 ) . But there are local alternatives all around . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Home ##wood Suite ##s in Chicago on Grand Avenue was a te ##rri ##fic place to stay . It was in a good location to access the tourist sites by walking or short taxi rides . The staff was pleasant and helpful . The suite was room ##y and clean . It was nice having a full kitchen if we had wanted to do some cooking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We attended a conference at this hotel . I have stayed here a few times in the past two years , I down ##graded my five - star review to four - star due to no pool . The location is great for the Navy Pier and Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and views of the river and pier area are nice . The area around the hotel is safe and the staff and v ##alet parking crew are very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , we had a decent time at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . The location was great , and the service was good . One thing that was not good was the elevators . They only have three , and only one of them was working throughout most of our stay . We stayed on the 10th floor and had to make that walk a couple of times . But the rooms were good , and the bed was comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was filthy , the furniture was torn apart and needed to be replaced , including the bed . The maid service was supposed to come 2 ##X ' s a day and only came 1 time for the 2 nights we were there and never re ##ple ##nish ##ed the toilet ##ries . The bed sheets were stained and I called to have them replaced , it was never done . This was a terrible experience and I am extremely upset that I used my 2 free award nights at this disgusting location . I have never been so disappointed in a hotel stay , especially at a Fair ##mont ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for two nights while attending a conference at the hotel . Everything was great - only draw ##back was the pool at night was filled with kids ; and I do mean filled . We stayed on the club level and really enjoyed it . The location is also great for exploring Navy Pier and downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice location for Michigan Ave , Loop , or River North destinations . Walk ##able to Mill ##eni ##um Park and Art Institute - when its not too cold ! . Nice rooms - we went for the gold ##fish companion for fun . Restaurant is fair but solid for bar drinks ( very good bartender ) and breakfast . Had to stay an extra night due to an ice storm in home city and was accommodate ##d sea ##m ##lessly . Wine and hot c ##ider ( spike ##d and non ) happy hour . As with all Kim ##pton ##s - a bout ##ique fun feel that benefits from the chain ' s good taste and standards is without unwanted surprises . Next to the Virgin Hotel and seems a much hip ##per and lively property . Fine for couples , families and small pets . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really Love ##d It Here ! It Was Very Clean & ’ S ##mell ##ed Really Good . The Staff Was Amazing & ’ I Would High ##ly Re ##com ##men ##d This Place To Family & ’ Friends . Bed ##s Were Extreme ##ly Co ##m ##fort ##able & ’ The Bath ##room Was So Amazing My Favorite Lo ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good hotel suffering of lack of renovation . The bathroom ##s show their age , more than a few items in the room were not operating correctly , very small safe ( could not fit any computer ) . Free W ##if ##i at 20 M ##bs if you are a She ##rato ##n fi ##delity program member . Good to consider if the Hotel for your convention . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Rosemary Miller was our guest services host on our floor . She was smart , humble , funny and asked to come in and clean our room . Charles was great at the front door and so was the restaurant . It ’ s the best outdoor cafe in the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always get things back to basic ##s such as : - did I sleep well ? Yes , beds and linen are so great - have I been considered and heard ? Yes - was the bathroom imp ##ec ##ca ##ble ? Yes - was the location enhancing my visit ? Absolutely For excellence it is necessary to go beyond checking all the boxes by creating the en ##chan ##tment of the stay I ##dea ##lly located on Man ##ific ##ient Mile , O ##m ##ni offers perfect services . Room ##s are just great in size . In our case a corner suite with a city ##view ##s . Service could be considered also as perfect . The decoration which is slightly old - fashioned would be the only aspect that make O ##m ##ni not trend ##y . Bravo ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here last year at around Thanksgiving time . Even though there is a huge choice of hotels in Chicago , we decided to go back here as we loved it so much last year . Just as good . A great breakfast included in the room rate - cereal ##s , p ##or ##ridge , m ##ues ##li , yo ##gh ##urt ##s etc . And past ##ries , dough ##nut ##s , rolls , hard boiled eggs . Coffee , tea etc . They still have the 2 hour happy hour period when you can have compliment ##ary wines and beers in the lounge area - great ! The rooms are a fair size for city rooms - noticed a few s ##cu ##ffs on the walls this year . Love ##ly comfortable big bed and compliment ##ary toilet ##ries . S ##nac ##ks for sale in the room . And a fridge to store bits if you wish . A very good experience once again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The main problem with this hotel is the lack of staff . We had a 20 minute wait to check in with one member of staff going off on a break while we were waiting , and you could hear everyone in the que ##ue complaining . They also need more staff at the bar . We tried to catch the waiting staff attention three times and even went to the bar to be told someone would come over , after another 15 minutes we gave up . I would expect better service from a hotel of this standard . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is a hotel we go to often . They have great deals , and it ' s at a great location . The breakfast served on every floor is a perfect way to start the day . The manager ' s reception is also a great way to begin your evening . The staff offers great service and look out for their customers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall experience was wonderful but the best part was the exquisite comfort of the bed ! It was like sleeping on a giant pillow . The am ##bian ##ce of the room was warm and air ##ey . Bath ##room clean , slip ##pers & robe comfortable and room service in the morning was professional and pro ##mpt . Breakfast was solid and just as expected . Overall stay met and even exceeded my expectations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at Kim ##pton Hotels for years - - and I hope that the takeover by the I ##H ##G ( Intercontinental Hotel Group ) doesn ' t spell the end to Kim ##pton ' s renowned hospitality . But big business can do that . My stay in Chicago was marred by a strange Ser ##v ##p ##ro blow ##er placed outside of my hotel room . The smell in the hall coupled with the loud blow ##er did not make for a rest ##ful evening . I was told at 6 : 00 it would be gone in an hour or so . Not so . At 11 : 00 it was still blowing loudly . Anyway , Kim ##pton is fine but there are S ##O many other places in Chicago . Seems like I ##H ##G may have popped the Kim ##pton brand ' s balloon . The person at the desk basically said , " Sorry . It should get better . " [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay with Hampton Inn . It is in walking distance of great shopping , dining and theaters . The v ##alet staff who greet you at the door were helpful in telling us how to check in on the 6th floor . There we were greeted by the friendly front desk to check into our delight ##ful corner suite . The only downfall was the sofa sleep ##er needed a new matter ##ess . It was very thin and uncomfortable . Everything else was amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] High class hotel . Nice rooms , top class service . All that you can want from hotel like She ##rato ##n . View from room was imp ##res ##ive . Excellent hotel , but there is one - . Free W ##i - Fi only on ground floor . Every other internet is $ $ [SEP]
1	[CLS] This bout ##ique style hotel is situated in the gold coast area with many options to shop and eat in the area . The hotel is awesome , clean , with friendly staff and nice bar to un ##wind . There is also a gym . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a lovely , clean and friendly hotel . The location is fantastic and I love the morning set up for breakfast on each floor ! G ##rab your robe and s ##hu ##ffle down the hall w your bed tray to get coffee and a delight ##ful continental breakfast . The front desk staff were f ##abulous as was door ##men and the sweet maid who t ##id ##ied my room each day . I ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is in a great location and the rooms are H ##U ##GE for a big city hotel . Very clean rooms and attention to detail by the entire staff . Breakfast was way over ##p ##rice ##d and a better experience can be had at many other options nearby . But overall the hotel and rooms are great and will be our go - to hotel in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came here for a business meeting with colleagues on a Friday afternoon . Traffic was nuts but once I parked , check in was really easy and fast . I stayed in the 7th floor which had a modest view of other buildings . We used one of their small meeting rooms downstairs which had all that we needed . The staff were very helpful and friendly . The rooms were comfortable and clean . Location was te ##rri ##fic and lots of food / drink options within walking distance . I would happily stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel . We were amazed at just how large the room was and how comfortable the bed was . The quality of the furnishings was generous for the price of the room and the location was in walking distance to the navy pier , millennium park , and right across the street from the awesome river walk . We very much enjoyed our stay there and would definitely stay at Swiss ##ote ##l again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms and lobby are newly re ##mo ##del ##ed and are very nice . The suites are home ##y and comfortable and we like that the hotel offers compliment ##ary breakfast . Central ##ly located and easy to access downtown Chicago . Visiting EA ##TA ##L ##Y around the block is a M ##US ##T ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Park ##ing and Vale ##t at $ 70 / day is a rip ##off . Coffee maker , but No coffee cups in the room . No ##is ##y ! We were placed by the elevators and ice machine . You have to take two elevators to get outside . The restaurant and bar is tiny and over ##p ##rice ##d . . . even for Chicago . Many better options with great locations ( this is a great location ) on Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile with better value overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First , W ##OW ! First trip ever to Chicago and first Chicago Marathon . I could not have stayed at a better hotel . A ride was provided to the Chicago marathon the morning of . Was there in plenty of time . Food was provided in the morning also . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been staying at the Hilton Chicago for over 20 years . The staff is second to none , always cheerful , and eager to help . It is nice to be greeted by a staff member who recognizes you from a previous visit , and calls you by name . Also recommend food & beverage . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The location is very good : near all the places I want to visit . The staff were friendly , and the room was in good condition . The food in the club was healthy and high quality . It would be better with more var ##ai ##ble choices day to day . [SEP]
0	[CLS] In the heart of it all best location to be for everything ! The staff was excellent helpful on transportation ways to get to from airport or around town gave wonderful directions and took care of all our shopping to ship home no worries took care of us and met all our needs ! Was so ##o easy s ##tree ##s ##free worry free that ' s how a vacation ##s suppose to be th ##x so ##o much O ##m ##ni hotel staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been staying at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago for almost a decade . Con ##sist ##ently clean and impressive customer service and management . Te ##rri ##fic location , close to all downtown travel spots . I go during Christmas time , and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Mill ##eni ##um Park and many others are within walking distance ! T ##hum ##bs up ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I absolutely love the Swiss . I am originally from New York and this was my first time visiting . I have three children and they were extremely tired before our flight . The young lady Lane ##tte at the desk started making funny voices and playing with my youngest daughter while checking me out . She was also the person who made sure we were given enough beds after a mix up at check in . I absolutely love the city and I will be back soon to stay at the s ##wi ##ss ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a central location ! Support ##ed by an at ##ten ##tive staff and great service . we actually had busy plans and the hotel took us in early and not only found us a room but upgraded us to a suite . Loving those Kim ##pton moments that employees are em ##powered to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is convenient in location and for carrying out a meeting . The services and staff are a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting through out the stay . They did make the extra effort in the room and food services . It was worth the value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the large sitting / lounge window si ##lls . Had a great time watching people walk by while enjoying a glass of wine with friends . We had one minor draw ##back : our shower drain wasn ' t slope ##d right and we ended up with a bathroom floor covered in water . Wasn ' t too bad , just a bit of a mess . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador Hotel Chicago is a very nice small hotel in a very nice hood just 15 minutes form Chicago downtown . All the staff is very friendly . The hotel bar is one of the cool ##est I ' ve ever seen . Room ##s are modern and have a good size . Bath ##room are small and not very updated . P ##lent ##y of restaurants and bars within ##g walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Been here since Thursday . Was actually quite happy with the hotel until I arrived back from a wedding and was locked out of my room . Came down to front desk and they claimed there was no card on my file . Con ##cer ##ning because I did give my card at check - in ( they wouldn ' t have checked my in otherwise ) . They played it off as if it was my fault . Wouldn ' t recommend this hotel . Stay anywhere else if you care about your card security and decent customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We especially enjoyed the complementary cocktail ##s . Josh , the bartender at the Double Cross lounge , was excellent ! He single - handed ##ly creates a fun and casual atmosphere so that guests can relax and enjoy from 5 - 7 . I looked forward to coming back to the hotel and grabbing a glass of wine from him . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is newly renovated . The hotel is very clean . Am ##eni ##ties in the hotel and in the room are great ! The location is perfect for business , shopping & dining . Staff are friendly and helpful . One will feel secured because front entrance is well manned , and entry to guest floors is highly restricted . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a Gold Level room , staying 9 / 4 - 6 . The Gold lounge was an unexpected highlight , the staff were truly outstanding , and we enjoyed having a peaceful spot to watch the city and enjoy snack ##s and cocktail ##s , this spoiled us for future hotel stays . However the room ( 1620 ) was a bit hit or miss for a premium experience . The con ##s : The AC wasn ' t working up to par , the room was quite stuff ##y - we even had to prop the door open . The carpet was f ##ray ##ed and pulled up at the edges . And the plea ##ther bed frame was p ##eel ##ing and f ##ray ##ed in places , including right in the middle of the head ##board which was the most off putting . The pro ##s : We did have a good view of the lake , the bathroom was beautiful and very functional as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff is very professional . Great hotel close to everything ! Great fitness center with three great restaurant options . The Big Bar service awful during our stay . The others more than made up for this ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] staff were friendly and very helpful with restaurant suggestions , travel between airports etc . Location is fantastic between the river and the ma ##gni ##ficient mile . Fresh in ##fused water greeted us daily which we welcomed during the heat wave of July 2015 , Breakfast was convenient ##ly located on each floor adding to the comfort ##abe ##l and relaxed v ##ibe of this hotel . i will highly recommend this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 2 nights for meeting in nearby Hancock building . Was given a room on the top floor , 16th , which was very spacious and surprisingly quiet despite being right next to the elevator . Excellent black ##out blind ##s . Room did not have a desk to work on or a closed in closet , which would have been nice , especially considering the room size . The G ##rab and Go breakfast options were good and included in the room price . Ku ##dos for reducing waste in the fruit and cheese option and not individually packaging the ingredients . Very convenient to place your order the night before and time pick up after your work ##out in the gym in the basement . Also appreciated the re ##fill ##able di ##spense ##rs in the shower . No issues with elevator speed or wait time I had seen in previous posts . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you ’ re there for a conference or for the experience of Chicago , this is the perfect hotel . Central ##ly locate ##s and staffed with the most incredible a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting personnel . My experience was para ##mount , and I bet yours will be too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Do not depend on the Bell desk for Tax ##is , in particular when you are leaving for the Airport . Absolutely no help in spite of making calls to them 15 m ##ts in advance . They don ' t even have Tax ##i Companies ' phone numbers . Don ' t bother to answer calls from the room . Not ##ice ##d spending the time ch ##it chatting when guests are lined up for Tax ##i during a rainy morning , trying to go to the Airport . You are very likely to miss the flight . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel while visiting friends in Chicago . The hotel is located in the theater district and also on " restaurant row " ( i . e . Randolph Street ) . It was great to be in walking - distance to so many of the city ' s attractions . The hotel is very clean and the staff is very nice . In some of the Trip ##A ##d ##visor reviews I read about the hotel before booking , people stated that they experienced noise problems so I was a little worried . However , we didn ' t have any problems with noise and even noted that it was one of the quiet ##er hotels we ' ve ever stayed at . The hotel also was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting of our late flight out of Chicago by allowing us to store our luggage in the coat room until it was time for us to head to the airport . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a great trip to Chicago at the So ##fit ##el ! The staff and service were amazing ##ly helpful and made sure we had a safe and enjoyable stay . Scott from the front office was incredible . Will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great staff that we love to see upon each return . Great location . Bar area just renovated with outdoor seating available . Restaurant is French based cuisine . Fellow guests generally represent various world locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very pleasant hotel - fast elevators to the top floors which is one of my pet p ##ee ##ves if they aren ' t fast . The con ##cier ##ge was great - I understand that they need to recommend other She ##rato ##n properties - like Eddy V ' s - which was very expensive , more than we ' d ever do without ending up there accidentally on their recommendation , but actually very good . And the music , they have to stop with that can ##ned jazz music which is everywhere - but the new restaurant with the b ##urger ##s downstairs is excellent and what a great location ! Very comfortable beds - really enjoyed our stay . Also I really think if you ' re paying top dollar and are a She ##rato ##n member , you should have free w ##i - fi . it ' s just an insult to have to pay for that . The Mar ##riot ##t ' s policy on that is so much better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient location for the Theater area . Near major shopping . Friendly staff . Nice accommodation ##s . Only wished not having to depend on price ##y Vale ##t service to stay at this hotel . En ##joy ##ed the compliment ##ary evening reception and morning breakfast . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent service from the moment we drove up to the hotel , all the way to our departure three days later . Room was clean and well laid out . My husband said he enjoyed the work out room every morning . Most importantly , we liked the welcoming atmosphere in the lobby , where the restaurant and sports bar were located . The fresh contemporary architecture and furnishings made for a relaxing stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quite the impression from the street and arrival - spectacular lobby space and comfortable places to hang out . It is an old hotel , however , which you ' ll experience in your room . T ##ight space , including a tiny bathroom . For the price , I was as ##to ##und ##ed that we didn ' t even have coffee in the room for morning , and no room service to bring it . P ##lug ##s by the bed didn ' t work , no bath mat , and limited amenities at hand . Nice mini bar and snack offering , but a sign with a threat that if you even move something from it ' s place , it will automatically charge you . Won ' t go back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have stayed at the Fair ##mont Hotel several times in the past . It once had beautiful views of the city but is now surrounded by other buildings . Still it is a nice hotel . Our only negative was that I had purchased a spa treatment for my wife . The treatments were fine but the desk attendant told her how much she was expected to tip because we had gotten such a good price on the package . This was out of order in our opinion . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff was very good and upgraded me to a suite . It was a great room with a great view of the street below . The happy hour was great with food from ST ##K ##house and a full bar . They gave me 3 coins that allowed me to have 3 drinks . Overall a very good hotel and i will be staying there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is wonderful . My daughter and I recently visited Chicago to tour colleges and see Hamilton , and we took a guess on where to stay in the general downtown area . Everything here was exceptional from the service at the door to the from desk to the cafe to the comfortable and well - appointed room to the ease of check - in and check - out . We are dinner one night at the restaurant and had breakfast two days there , and the food and service were f ##abulous . The price point was incredibly reasonable too both for hotel and cafe . I would definitely stay here again . Re ##mind ##ed me of some European hotels I have stayed in over the years . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Is a great option . ! The location is good , many restaurants around , stores and fun . Is the heart of the city . Em ##p ##loy ##ees are really q ##ui ##ali ##fied and commit ##ed to your satisfaction . Breakfast is ok but better than the standard with other chains . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am staying 6 days here and to be honest the hotel is very good calm and comfortable room . I like the new modern design . . . The bed is Amazing The staff is helpful and supportive . . . as I want to appreciate the duty manager Dani ##al on his support . . . Try to be in the east tower . . . Also the location is very strategic . . . in the middle of high brand shops and also near magnificent mi ##ke like 3 min ##ue ##ts walk . . The Le bar is in the corner of the hotel and it is great and you can have whatever drink you like . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has been updated and the room we had was exceptional . It was large with nice kitchen ##ette , and well - appointed accommodation ##s . The hotel is in a great location for access to Michigan Avenue shopping and some great restaurants , as well as Mill ##eni ##um Park and the Institute of Art . Very pleased with our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kenny is outstanding at this place never seen better energy ! I came in he gave me great information on surrounding places to eat introduce a great preview of the hotel along with my parking options , never better [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with a cow ##or ##ker for a conference in June . The hotel is very clean and well kept . Our room had a view overlooking the river . They were able to handle the large numbers of people checking in at once . The location is great and within walking distance to lots of restaurants and sights ##ee ##ing opportunities . I would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great property , with generous size rooms , and nice designs . The al f ##res ##co dining area was a delight ##ful way to enjoy your meals under the summer sun . The staff are helpful , but D ##wayne on the door is a wonderful person to greet you and say farewell , who was always there to help . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed over Labor Day weekend for my husband ' s birthday . We had a king size room with a good view of the river below . I enjoyed the pool while my husband worked out . As other reviews indicated , parking is expensive ! We parked in Ogden Plaza and were turned around when we left . It would ' ve been nice to have compliment ##ary breakfast . We had con ##cier ##ge book us on the Wendell ##a Si ##ght ##see ##ing Boat Tour and she ended up charging my credit card twice . I had to call them once we got home and have her credit my account . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t for 50 something girls weekend which included theater tickets . Love ##d everything about the hotel , including its location in the theater district . Every staff member was pleasant and anticipated our needs . Front desk got us pleasant ##ly upgraded . Our rooms were huge and adjoining . Hotel bar was beautiful and fun . Breakfast left us feeling completely satisfied . This iconic beauty has to be experienced . Go here , you ’ ll be delighted . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for St . Patrick ' s Day of this year . Location is great ( steps from both the Chicago River and Mill ##eni ##um Park ) and within walking distance of everything downtown you ' d want to see . Room is loaded with all kinds of little amenities ( Ke ##uri ##g Coffee Maker , co ##rks ##cre ##w , glasses , robes ) E ##X ##CE ##P ##T for free w ##if ##i ( they really need to re ##thin ##k this - no one charges for w ##if ##i anymore . no one . ) We had a corner room , on a lower floor but still a beautiful view .

Pro T ##ip : Sign up for the President ' s Club at check - in to get free w ##if ##i and access to the fitness center . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent trip the entire ex ##per ##in ##ce was great form the hotel staff to the rest ##ira ##nts to the public transportation to the tourist events . Even the weather held up . . . One of the best v ##aca ##tu ##ons I ever had . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying at this Hilton and our stay was fantastic . Super ##b service , especially from the restaurant staff . The chef prepared for us a huge dessert the moment he saw us with our White Sox fear and immediately greeted us . We felt right at home . Special thanks to Mario , Thomas , and Jay for always taking such good care of us during breakfast . The food was amazing . The only has ##sle during the stay was having to wait so long to check in and also to see someone from front desk whenever we needed to get our key re ##p ##rog ##ram ##med ( 15 - 20 ##mins waiting time ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Selected this hotel for it ' s location and reputation . Is ideal ##ly located to explore all of Chicago . Room ##s are small but adequate . Staff very helpful and well trained . There are a good number of rooms that look out on noisy construction , air conditioning units , etc . so make a special request and / or be prepared to make one or more trips to the front desk after check - in to get a room that works for you ( we did ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice bout ##ique Hotel , amazing staff . Close to a lot of restaurants and clubs . Room ##s are very clean and comfortable and Melissa from the front office is just a very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and cheerful person . We will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] From check in to departure the stay was superb . The front desk staff were so helpful advising and organising sights ##ee ##ing trips and restaurants . The choose of food and drink excellent and the location of the hotel perfect for our purposes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel in a prime location in Chicago . The weather was not so cold so I was able to walk everywhere . Rate includes continental breakfast , which is set up on each floor outside the elevators , for your convenience as they don ' t have an on - site restaurant . Although it was kind of basic ( continental after all ) , it was p ##lent ##iful and had good quality products . My only disappointment was house ##keeping . The service wasn ' t bad , it was just not consistent throughout my 4 nights / 5 days stay . Overall this is a great hotel to enjoy downtown Chicago , whether you are visiting for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie once a year for business travel . This hotel is so clean and comfortable , with a good free breakfast convenient ##ly located on each floor , with a cute wood tray to gather your breakfast on . The night ##ly evening reception is great , free ! and good drinks and plenty of food . It does get crowded , so show up early if schedule allows . The hotel is in a great location in River North , and a short walk to the Loop . Staff is very helpful and friendly , and would stay here for personal trips as well . However , be aware that Friday and Saturday nights can be quite noisy , depending on what side of the hotel your room is . But it ' s Chicago , so join in on the fun ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] we met this amazing young lady named Gail Walker she was super helpful and fun to talk to fair ##mont if you see this i suggest that you give her a raise as she ##s a super good help ##er . Thank you Fair ##mont , And thank you Gail Best regards r ##hy ##s j m ##us ##grave [SEP]
1	[CLS] this was a business trip , and the hotel had excellent service . I am a pick ##y travel ##er and would definitely recommend and stay here again .

1	[CLS] Dec ##ent hotel but nearby night clubs and bars blast music till at least midnight . R ##id ##ic ##ulously noisy , like a Beat ##s Pi ##ll blast ##ing in your room . Not acceptable for business travelers or anyone expecting to go to sleep before 2 ##am . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at this hotel 3 times over the years and they never di ##sa ##pp ##oint . The staff is extremely friendly and helpful . The hot breakfast was very good . The rooms are comfortable and clean . It was nice having a full size refrigerator and a microwave . Lots of families stay here but I would recommend it to anyone . It is so convenient to all the attractions . Wonderful place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a horrific Mar ##riot ##t property . Got in Thursday night at 11 : 50 . 10 people in line an led one person at desk . No apology — - almost a “ dude - f * * k you - we are Mar ##riot ##t ” . No house keeping today . Had to call for towels and still none . Lo ##bby s ##tin ##ks like fish . Imagine Mar ##riot ##t Times Square . But worse . Total amateur hour . Need ##ed a new key today and had to stand in line for 25 minutes w a bunch of amateur ##s to get it . Just stay away . Management has zero idea how to handle a full house . Bo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##o [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Location ! Friendly and helpful Staff ! Love ##d this hotel and will stay again ! The sleep ##er sofa wasn ' t the best , but the actual bed was very comfortable . The breakfast each morning was On - Point and had many options , warm and cold . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the O ##m ##ni for four nights and it was an incredible vacation . The staff is incredibly friendly . The rooms are a great size and the bed is so comfortable . Simon in the restaurant bar is out of this world , friendly and very good at his job . The location is perfection . Can ##not wait to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was amazing ! The staff is very friendly and awesome ! They make you feel at home . I will always look into a Kim ##pton hotel . Hello ! Free wine everyday at 5 ! Great location and views of the river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful room with a nice view , even if it was of the Trump sign . But the service and staff were the best and made our trip even more enjoyable . It seems as if all the rooms have nice views and not blocked . And the location is first rate . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was the second time I ’ ve stayed at the Palmer House while touring Chicago . It was better than two years ago . The location is very close to the Art Institute of Chicago , my main objective . It is also very convenient for the “ Bean ” and other tourist attractions . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had a nice stay at this historic hotel in downtown Chicago . I understand this hotel is over 100 years old and used to be a Conrad Hilton . The bed was soft and comfortable . The room was very quiet . The hotel staff were very polite . I will definitely come back again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wonderful experience overall . We have recommended this hotel to our grown children and grandchildren for future stay . It would be nice to know what choices of view you have from this hotel and how to have access to highest stories to get that view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We we ' re in town for a wedding and the wedding party was booked at the Talbot ##t . What a wonderful small hotel ! We had four rooms on the same floor ( were nicely upgraded ) . The rooms were large and very comfortable , no view unfortunately . The service throughout was pleasant and e ##ff ##uc ##ient . The location is awesome , easy walks to many attractions , fine dining , shopping , and bars . I would definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Your place was awesome . All of the staff were very friendly and helpful . Check in and out was very easy . Our room was very clean and extremely nice . We loved the bed and amenities as well . Not once did we have any difficulties with anything [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my 5th time to Chicago , but first time at So ##fit ##el . The location of the hotel was awesome . It ' s 3 blocks from a bust ##ling area off N . Rush with high end shops and outdoor restaurants and bars . You ' re away from the chaos of Michigan Ave but still a few blocks away if you want to venture there . The room was beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable ! ! ! I will definitely stay here again when I go back to the city . 5 stars ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago is a beautiful hotel , the lobby area and restaurants are extremely nice . Big bar is a must you cannot visit this hotel without checking it out . I however was disappointed with the appearance of the rooms . For this hotel to be so elegant the rooms did not match the look of the hotel in my opinion . Everything was out ##dated from the carpet in the hallway ##s to the entire look of the room . Even with that being said I would stay here again in a heartbeat . The customer service here is superb . I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it for others my complaints are only co ##sm ##etic the rooms were im ##ma ##culate ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have stayed in maybe 100 different hotels in Chicago over the last 13 years . Conrad Chicago is likely the best service I have experienced so far . I know it is new but the commitment to the customer is remarkable , everyone knew me by name by my 3rd visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great river ##walk location . Everything is accessible from the hotel . You even have water activities right outside your room . Great steak restaurant in the hotel and enjoy a b ##urger on the river downstairs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We began our stay being upgraded for 30 / night for a " king bed " . . . the bed we ended up with in our room was smaller than a queen size . The room was dirty upon entry , a star ##bu ##ck lid was on the floor from a previous guest . The drains were backed up . The windows were filthy . Pain ##t was p ##eel ##ing off the walls . When we went to lay down , the bed didn ##t even have a fitted sheet on it , just a king sized sheet wrapped over a mattress cover . Hotel management was no help , and actually argued with us about the bed size , to the point we went and bought a tape measure to prove the point that it indeed was not a king sized bed . There are tons of better hotels for the same price , in even better centralized locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a nice place to stay . Good , not great . Its right on the river , so the location is good . Nice views . Staff are friendly . They messed up our bill . . . . so check your re ##ceipt closely , but I believe it was an honest mistake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was working so I ordered room service which came in 4 stages . Every time I sat down to work , the door ##bell rang with another part of the room serviced dinner I ordered . It was ridiculous . The room was also small compared to other rooms in Chicago . I could not recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Con ##ven ##ient location . Room was nicely decorated and im ##ma ##culate . Only complaint is that the furniture is so minimal that the coffee maker was kept in the dresser and then the only place it could be placed was on the desk so we had to then move the computer and other papers in order to plug it in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel but both elevators broke down at the exact same time while we stay there . We had to walk up and down 12 flights of stairs to get to and from our Room . The staff was really nice yet I could not get past walking up - and - down the stairs . This made for are you very uncomfortable weekend of leisure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a national conference at the She ##rato ##n Grand . I checked in July 4 , and the young women who assisted me was friendly and efficient . My room was very nice , room service for breakfast was also very nice . During the convention in the grand Ball ##room the temperature was ridiculous ##ly cold ! We asked several times for the te ##mp to be raised . Not one server or customer service person gave off a friendly v ##ibe and no smiles at all . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nice clean room and friendly helpful hotel staff . I didn ' t spend much time at the hotel but I would definitely stay here again . I wasn ' t able to check in early but I was able to leave my luggage and then go out and about . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family stayed here 8 years ago and this time I was with a friend to see Hamilton . Co ##m ##fort ##able and clean , convenient to where we wanted to go . Nice view of lake and a bit quiet ##er than the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here numerous times while in the Wind ##y City ! It ’ s always a pleasure and I know what to expect . The rooms are a nice size , beds are comfortable and the location is excellent ! Easy walking distance to so many spots in the Loop as well as train stops . Also , I ’ ve the bar they have inside - a great place to meet friends ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This 1920 ' s style hotel has charm and character in abundance . It ' s location is within walking distance to most tourist attractions . However , with a long history and tradition this hotel is a tourist attraction in its own right . A complementary historic tour of the hotel is offered to guests ; great for those interested in the history of Chicago . Well worth a stay if you want to visit this fantastic city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic location , top notch customer service and a lovely room . Breakfast available and a happy hour every day ! Staff was so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting in every area of our stay . My favourite hotel in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful . The bell ##man and reception ##ist were super helpful and kind . We felt safe in the hotel . The pool was absolutely wonderful ; I took my 2 . 5 y ##r old daughter and she just loved it . We had a great time , the room was clean - pretty simple , had what we needed . All in all it was a great stay and I would love to go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice ##ly decorated rooms with many little extra ##s . Extreme ##ly convenient to all types of food , attractions and shopping . Staff is very helpful . Good on - site restaurants . Well - equipped fitness center . No pool though . Would definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I absolutely Love ##d staying at Ambassador ! It ’ s a combination of great modern design and 19th c ##ert ##ify architecture . The hotel is a beauty ! I even sent the design ideas to my girlfriend ##s : ) Great service and price . Located in the city so you get a city feel . Will definitely come back and already recommended to my friends ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This could be a f ##abulous property . The historic features are awesome . However , the common areas & rooms are in need of a re ##f ##resh . The carpet in our room was very dirty . Most of the electrical outlets in the room did not work . The A / C air filter looked like it hadn ’ t been changed in years . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at many hotels in Chicago and none have been this clean and with great staff ! We were greeted right outside our U ##ber and everyone from him to the front desk , to the person who brought our luggage to our room were exceptional ! We came for my daughters 21st birthday and received an upgrade with a great view and window seat . Nothing beats the window seat ! This is the only hotel we will be staying at from now on ! ! ! ! ! Great location to everything ! Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n grand Chicago is a very nice hotel in the center of town very close to all the major attractions . The room we were in had an amazing view of downtown , the room was clean and nicely furnished , coffee machine a ##b ##d safe ( although the safe was small not large enough for a laptop but ok for an i ##Pad ) there is a fridge however , it was full of stuff to buy so there was no room for any personal items , the safe and fridge are two things that can be improved . The lounge is in a nice location in the hotel breakfast is very nice but there are limited choices after breakfast ( coffee , water , soft drinks and g ##rano ##la bars ) . The staff were very nice . All in all it was an excellent stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel that always makes us feel welcome and comfortable . Just steps from Michigan Avenue shopping and restaurants . The hotel restaurant / bar , Baptiste and Bo ##ttle , is on the 20th floor adjacent to the lobby and front desk . They have a very good selection of b ##our ##bon ##s and the food is delicious . Haven ' t had an opportunity to try No ##yan ##e on the roof yet but hear it ' s great . Hopefully next trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome location and W ##ON ##DE ##R ##F ##U ##L staff . We enjoyed our room , although it was a little small . I like the policy of replacing towels only every 3rd night , unless requested ( it ' s a nice effort from a really large hotel to cut down on usage ) . I don ' t think I would choose this kind of place if I weren ' t going to a conference , but they really handled the volume of people in - house quite well . And , of course , walking distance to Millennium Park , among a million other things , was a huge bonus ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Smile ##s on the faces of O ##M ##NI staff members all around no matter where I was in the hotel . Kris ##top ##her Campbell was awesome to deal with , gave great recommendations . The bell staff was outstanding . I wish all hotels had such great people working for them , it would make travelling for business so much less stress ##ful . Thank you to all , your efforts are G ##RE ##AT ##L ##Y appreciated ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] River North is the tourist magnet . Don ' t get pulled in . Stay in Gold Coast at this historic hotel that has been transformed into a modern , s ##wi ##sh , and cool space . River North is bra ##sh , busy , and full . The Gold Coast and Public are a short taxi or U ##ber ride away . The P ##ump Room bar has great cocktail ##s , keeping with Chicago ' s trend toward classic cocktail offerings . The rooms are well - appointed and clean . The staff is helpful and professional . The hotel food is great ( if expensive ) , and nearby are a number of good restaurants with a relaxed v ##ibe . Public cater ##s to the sophisticated travel ##er . Be sophisticated ; stay at Public . Don ' t be obvious and un ##ori ##gin ##al and stay in a River North chain hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was clean and fresh . It ' s in a nice area north of the river close to lots of restaurants and walking distance to all the sights . You are charged about $ 16 / night , a resort fee I think , for a continental breakfast . The breakfast is on each floor , which is nice unless your room is close by like ours and then you ' re awakened between 5 : 30 and 6 each morning with c ##link ##ing noises during setup . The happy hour was also nice providing you with app ##eti ##zers and a set number of drinks . The people working at the hotel are very friendly and helpful . Overall , a nice place to stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton has done an amazing job re ##nova ##ting this grand old hotel . The common spaces are huge and gorgeous . The features are almost all updated ( bath ##tub ##s seem original ) and they did an almost great job noise proof ##ing ( not nearly as good as the newer hotels in Chicago . ) the de ##cor is beautiful and modern . The rooms are very pretty , just S ##O small . I stayed here b ##c the city was super expensive . I would do it again under the same circumstances . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very warm & welcoming hotel . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms , good food & great bar . We enjoyed our historic hotel tour , conducted by the very kind con ##cier ##ge . We looked forward to a great night ' s rest after our busy Chicago days ! We will definitely stay here on our next trip . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I travelled to Chicago for a girls weekend trip . We have been doing this trip for at least 10 years . We have stayed at various hotels . The Conrad would definitely be our favorite hotel . We will return for our future weekends . Everything was perfect . Custom ##er service exceeded every other hotel we have stayed at ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] While there on business and the conference being held in the hotel , it was highly convenient . Now while it ' s a great place for a conference , the conference break ##out rooms themselves were quite compact and facilities are not within easily accessible areas . The service was fantastic , food was just ok , the the location was clean but the rooms may need a bit of an update . All in all , a very suitable hotel for a brief conference [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came up for the afternoon Cubs game on Saturday ( 5 / 7 / 16 ) . We were trying for early check in because the game started at 3 and K ##wa ##me did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . He was right there at the front counter greeting us with a smile . He was knowledge ##able and made check in a breeze . The rooms were very nice and spacious . Can ' t wait to have a reason to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was a central ##ly located . Hotel was clean and staff was great ! Special thanks to Ra ##fi the door ##man who was amazing when our rental car reservation got cancelled and we had to s ##c ##ram ##ble to O ' ha ##re to fix it ! Would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] NE ##VE ##R going to stay in any Conrad franchise ever again . Called the hotel regarding some urgent issue and have to modify the reservation . The operator could not solve my issue but the manager was not willing to have the flexibility to help . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is amazing . The property has an interesting history - - an Al Cap ##one hide ##out on the 14th floor with secret ( no longer ) staircase for his escape . However - - the carpet in our room was very worn . The bed hard . The shower door was hung crooked ##ly so that it could not close tightly . Maid service superb . The con ##cier ##ge was missing from his post most of the time and the one time I did see him he seemed very mi ##ffed that folk had taken free ##bie hand ##out Chicago maps off his desk while he was absent . ( There were more on a table across the lobby ) . We parked our car with the v ##alet only to discover upon pick up that our license plate had been almost torn off the car and my No ##ok was missing . Not impressed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Mill ##eni ##um kn ##icker ##bo ##cker was a lovely older fashioned hotel , the hotel has lots of history about it and a lovely old fashioned ballroom and ma ##rt ##ini bar . The guitarist ##s in the bar in the evening weren ##t to our taste but would be too other people . Staff were lovely and we got a lovely compliment ##ary upgrade to a suite as it was a special birthday / anniversary trip . Location of hotel was fantastic being just off magnificent mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is perfect . We entered the hotel along with many others to attend a conference . Sur ##p ##rising ##ly only 3 of the many counters were staffed and so check in took about 45 minutes . The room itself was dated , sparse , and not worthy of the Hilton name . The carpet ##s had stain ##s and seemed worn . The hotel is is need of a complete re ##mo ##del . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is central ##ly located . Shop ##s ( Michigan Avenue ) are within ##g walking distance . Some rooms offer a wonderful view on the lake . G ##ym is included ; unfortunately the swimming pool has been closed . The bar and restaurant are nice . Staff is very friendly . Breakfast is great , though a little over ##p ##rice ##d . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l is my hotel of choice for the Chicago Marathon – it ’ s a short 10 minute walk to the start / finish in Grant Park , the spa is available for shower ##ing / changing after the 1 : 00 P ##m runner check - out and the rooms are wonderful ##ly appointed , spacious and provide ma ##rve ##lous views of Chicago . The front desk service was first class – especially the room upgrade to the 26th floor . This was my third consecutive year at the Swiss ##ote ##l … … … . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel for 3 nights based on location and a good price from Book ##ing . com We loved it ' s position just off Michigan Ave . Great for picking up the bus tour outside Hancock and breakfast at L ' app ##eti ##to . We had a room on the 8th floor facing the front . It was nice but quite small . The bed and bathroom were the best features . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed that a framed print on the wall was missing the glass . Staff we met were all very friendly . I ' d come back in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel All ##egro is a very modern hotel in the theatre district . Short cab ride or walking distance to most locations within the city . The bell men had some of the nice ##st , most persona ##ble gentlemen that I have ever encountered traveling . They were super kind to my daughters and made a point of showing interest in their adventures in Chicago . The only thing missing from this hotel was a swimming pool . Beautiful hotel and nice amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at the Fair ##mo ##m ##t was very nice ! First of all the rooms are great . They are decorated taste ##fully and the beds are comfortable . The gold lounge also holds that standard . The staff is great and so is the service . Of course the location of the Fair ##mont is great as well . With only a 15 minute walk to navy pier and the magnificent mile as well as just a 5 minute walk into grant park , the hotel is very central and a per ##fe ##kt starting point for day trips . I can definitely recommend the Fair ##mont Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I come to the RS ##NA convention most years and I usually stay at the She ##rato ##n because of the staff in The club lounge . For instance , Connie has been in the club ever since my first stay here . She un ##fa ##iling is thoughtful , kind , and professional . I see her taking care of each individual , looking for ve ##get ##arian snack ##s for customers who don ’ t eat meat , getting ice and a c ##itrus slice if you need it . She makes an average stay at a good hotel a special stay for each of her guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 5 nights for a convention at McCormick Place . Couldn ’ t be more pleased with this high class , up to date hotel . P ##lent ##y of in house restaurants , bars , and coffee shops . Easy walk to Michigan Avenue shopping and restaurants all over downtown . Staff went out of their way to serve . No complaints [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel and convenient location . Big rooms with nice view , mainly looking at the river . Very close to Michigan Avenue , shopping and din ##ning options . Overall service meets average travelers ' expectations . [SEP]
0	[CLS] As a rewards member who ’ s stayed at multiple H ##ya ##tt Regency properties , I expected to be treated better than I was in Chicago . One of the worst experiences I ’ ve had at any hotel from low - budget Mo ##tel 6 to high - end R ##itz Carlton . This would not be my first choice when I travel back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Little and new Hotel is really well Located , 2 blocks from Michigan A ##v and 2 blocks from River . Near all the restaurants and bars of River North . Super safe area . People at lobby during 24 h ##rs 6 - story building with good size rooms with all basic facilities ( fridge , Coffee maker , W ##IF ##I , TV L ##CD , nice bathroom , safety box , iron ) . A basic breakfast b ##uff ##et is served in AL ##L floors in front of elevators area . Good enough to start a good day The business center is on 4th floor and you can send the do ##cs by email . An open bar on 6th Floor includes some free food and drinks to guests during some hours late afternoon with token ##s you receive during check - in My visitors really enjoyed this Hotel and I will recommend to everyone [SEP]
1	[CLS] We celebrated New Year Eve with fire works by hotel . Large loft , din ##ni ##g lounge and breakfast j ##n basement area . Nice de ##cor and excellent view of sky ##line . Room ##s are large and spacious . Breakfast is not included in charges for Room . You have to order from Men ##u . Children look forward for lots of var ##ities in foods and got di ##sp ##point ##ed . We get one Dr ##ink ##ing Water Bo ##ttle as co ##uts ##ey service . No courts ##y hot coffee and water cooler in lounge . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No Hotel Restaurant . Crow ##ded El ##eva ##tors , Lac ##k of outlets in the room . Hu ##mming sound coming from the refrigerator . Bell ##man who didn ' t want to bag check my briefcase that I didn ' t want to take to a lunch meeting outside the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] After staying here multiple , multiple times , The Palmer House remains a first class property based on the Chicago location , beauty of the hotel , the staff and overall comfort that Hilton provides . We ' ve taken other friends with us and they con ##cu ##r that The Palmer House is first class in every way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s look newly renovated . Spa ##cious living ##s area , kitchen , and bath . Pi ##llow ##s too soft , lo ##l . Front desk helpful with dinner recommendations and very efficient with a complicated bill . Good breakfast , not s great view from our room ( 90 ##1 ) but didn ' t really care as we weren ' t there too much . Great location steps from the red grand el stop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed 4 times in the past 3 years and have been satisfied with this hotel . The property is a little older but in reasonable condition with an warm staff . I would not hesitate to stay for a fifth time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great lake view , nice large rooms , friendly staff , delicious breakfast . Do not forget to learn ( hotel ) history going on elevators : - ) . Even the building is impressive , there are not many such huge hotels giving you pretty private atmosphere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing stay and so close to Chicago Marathon which was the reason for our trip . The location of this hotel is unique in that you have everything Chicago has to offer at your finger tips . The people were very friendly as well ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel frequently and like specific items in my room to stay on track with fitness and nutrition . Charge for re ##f ##ride ##rator in room isn ' t extra ##vage ##nt $ 25 for length of stay but you do need to request . Fitness center was a definite draw - im ##ma ##culate good choice of card ##io and weights , di ##sp ##osa ##ble ear ##bu ##ds and chilled ##to ##we ##ls in ##fused with essential oils were a bonus ! Room service is a limited menu with lots of up ##cha ##rg ##ing but decent fare and excellent staff . Light for ma ##gni ##fying mirror not working and never fixed during stay , batteries in t ##v never replaced upon request . annoying but not earth shattering . Close to Whole Foods , drugs ##tore ##s and great restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful room with personal touches including a fruit bowl and water to welcome me , turn down in the evening . Food at the hotel was excellent , as was the service provided at every level . Te ##rri ##fic location , too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent , professional service . Clean and efficient room with amenities . Gold floor was very helpful with my busy schedule that week . All staff was court ##eous and very willing to assist in all ways possible . I highly recommend this Hotel while in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are very dated . Te ##rrible mattress that sq ##ue ##aked at every movement . W ##oke up with a back ##ache . If I have a choice , I won ' t be back . Black ring around sink . This hotel cater ##s to the masses that are here for conferences . it is clear they put their money in the common areas and not the rooms [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location near restaurants the lake tours easy to get around . Friendly helpful staff compliment ##ary breakfast , internet access and daily paper plus great pool on roof with great views of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Conrad is a great hotel , but the price is too high when you compare it to a Four Seasons , Peninsula or five star hotel . It is not a five star hotel and should not be priced as a five star hotel . It is a good location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was greeted with smiles upon check - in . My room was spacious and comfortable , the hotel d ##é ##cor is inviting and very clean . The staff was super friendly and took time to answer questions about the city and places to visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Heads up ! Palmer does not provide a coffee maker in the room . That is a deal killer ! Wish I had checked into that first before booking this room . $ 300 + + / night and no coffee or tea in your room ! Bath ##rooms are not large enough for 2 people to spread toilet ##ries . Staff are ca ##val ##ier . . . do not seem to care that you are disappointed in their poor service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed there because our son was getting married in the city . We had a group who stayed and I have to say that the employees went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay ! Our group kind of took over the lobby of the hotel throughout the weekend and never felt like so comfortable ! They allowed us to continue the celebration , without any comments or concerns . With this whole pan ##de ##mic putting a damp ##er on the wedding , it was wonderful that they were so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! Thanks again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay here . Hotel was great , a little far away from a few things but great location for the price . We were still able to walk or bike almost anywhere . We would stay here again . Staff we encountered were great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The professional , court ##eous , warm staff check you into a room very obviously , and carefully , prepared with great thought for one ' s comfort . Room service is wonderful ; the Gold lounge is lovely . Whenever I am lucky enough to stay in a Fair ##mont property , I have high expectations . . . and the Fair ##mont Millennium Park certainly rose to the o ##cca ##ssion . I should also mention that a woman traveling alone will feel safe here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff , great views , excellent lounge and restaurant , nice price . Large room with first class furnishings . The location was close to everything Downtown yet quiet . I really enjoyed my stay there . [SEP]

1	[CLS] My parents had a beautiful surprise stay at Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for their 32nd wedding anniversary . The room was on the 6th floor so the view was breath ##taking , especially at night . I would definitely recommend this hotel to others . Also , I love the employee service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location to everything in Chicago . The rooms are large and good for a family travelling . The breakfast was delicious and the waiter ##s and chef ##s were very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The beds are comfortable after a long day walking out in the cold [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here recently on a weekend trip to Chicago . The hotel staff could not be nice ##r ! They left me a hand written note and sweet treats in our room for my birthday . Very thoughtful and much appreciated . The hotel was clean and very convenient to the river front , magnificent mile , the museums etc . We walked everywhere . The bathroom is small but that was the only negative we had with this hotel . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3 day stay was very nice . Great location . Staff all friendly . Nice work ##out facility . Room service was fast & good . Price competitive for location , quality & brand . We will come back for sure - enjoyed the stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had only one night in Second City for business . Found this g ##em which I remembered from my early days in Chicago , when there was an Ambassador East and West across the street from each other . Pleasant ##ly surprised by the modern upgrades - comfortable room , nice lobby , friendly staff , reasonable price . The location can ’ t be beat . Away from the noise , but within a short walk to lakes ##hore , Michigan Ave , subway , and old town . My only issue was no coffee in the room . Had to go to the lobby in the morning to buy it from the bar ##ista . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in room 237 ##7 and it sure would be nice to have an additional mirror in the room part . We had three adults in that room and it was a bit difficult getting ready in the morning . The mirror should also be located adjacent to an outlet . Looking forward to next year ' s conference and to see if this request is fulfilled . Thank you ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a wonderful hotel in a perfect location ! I was there for a work conference and the hotel couldn ' t be more welcoming . The food , accommodation ##s , and hotel space were fantastic ! Looking forward to returning to the hotel soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A group of friends and I stayed here for a girls trip . The rooms were nice and clean . The hotel staff , especially Bryant were friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , ensuring that we were all on the same floor . We also enjoyed the free wine at social hour ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] we stay at this hotel 100 % of the time we visit ch ##ica ##go . the location could not be better for us . . . rush street . the staff is exceptional . d ##wayne ne ##ff , bell ##man and greet ##er , goes above and beyond every time . he remembers us , personally . such a friendly and caring man . gene the con ##cier ##ge knows what you like to do and remembers us from visit to visit . i highly recommend this property [SEP]

0	[CLS] This is an awesome hotel . The location is great , the staff is excellent and the hotel itself is top notch . You will not regret your choice to stay at this hotel . The room is very clean . There is nothing that the staff won ' t do to make your stay enjoyable . I will not consider another hotel for my next stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suites here were perfect for families - spacious , full kitchen , and nice hot breakfast . The bathroom was so big , we were able to put our baby in the pack n play in there at night , and then our other child slept on the sofa bed . We all slept pretty well in our own spaces ! The location was also very convenient to lots of attractions and also transportation . The only draw ##back ( and it ' s a small one ) was that when we arrived , it wasn ' t clear how the v ##alet worked or where to drop our car off . We got it solved quickly though . We would stay here again . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with the family at the Fair ##mont Chicago and highly recommend the Gold level for families ! Great food throughout the day , exceptional service and complementary B ##m ##w bikes to ride all over the city . Perfect for a family or couple ' s vacation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed there for just one night as I was passing through to Lafayette . Had a room with a partial view of the lake . Friendly and helpful staff from front of house to bar staff and a comfortable and well equipped room . Hotel is close to the theatre district and a short walk to Millennium Park . Had a lovely stay and would certainly return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Immaculate lobby with very friendly and helpful staff . Room ##s are small but nice and bed was com ##fy . They really take care of you - they check in with texts to make sure you have everything . I forgot tooth ##pas ##te and it was delivered to my room all via text exchange . Can ' t wait to visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a new bout ##ique property of H ##ya ##tt . When I arrived at 8 pm , the front entrance was locked without any staff around . P ##ush ##ed the door bell many times with no one answered . Finally got in after someone came out . Bad start . The room was big , clean and the bed was comfortable . Had a breakfast without any special impression . But the neighborhood was great . It is also convenient to take U ##ber to McCormick Place if you come for conventions . Check out experience again was terrible . No one at the front desk at 5 am . P ##ush ##ed the alarm bell many times to get some attention . [SEP]
0	[CLS] K ##wa ##me , along with everyone at the front desk , were professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The rooms were te ##rri ##fic and the historic hotel is impressive ##ly maintained . The personnel at the hotel displayed a culture of professional hospitality that I appreciated . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel stay was awesome . I had no problems during my stay . The hotel is clean and the staff was very friendly . Whenever I required anything , the staff was on point . My room was cleaned daily and my bed was properly changed daily as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Date ##d hotel with me ##dio ##cre staff that ’ s just not up to today ’ s standards . I booked a suite and it did not even come with a free bottle of water . They charged me $ 8 for it . And at check ##out they mi ##sp ##laced my bill . Just not up to scratch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The All ##egro could be considered a bout ##ique hotel and it is nicely appointed and staffed with great people . The one down ##side to the hotel is that the rooms are more reminiscent of European bout ##ique hotels in that they are very small . The real negative for me , and I ' m only 5 ' 8 " 150 ##l ##b is that the shower was too small for even me to turn around in . I was also very di ##ssa ##tisfied with the quality of the internet . It kept going out and when it would work it was exceeding ##ly poor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff and a great room . Located nearby many sight seeing locations . Evening social was new to me and was good . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast was good . I took one king bedroom suite with city view and k ##iche ##n . The room was excellent and the equipment ##s were in very good condition . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Old aged Hotel with with very poor ins ##ulated room N # 310 ##6 . I was feeling the wind and cold from outside t ##rough the windows . I complained they offered me to change room but packing all my stuff for only 1 night no thanks ! Instead they offered 31 us ##d room service charges thanks for that but it will not make me feel better about the overall experience . Additionally the price of the parking is ridiculous ##ly high . 75 us ##d / night which is 15 - 20 us ##d higher than same hotel range in Chicago Dow ##town . Last but not least this room is located not far away from firefighters . Low value for the price [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay during CO ##VI ##D and we were impressed by the clean ##liness of the room and kindness of the staff . San ##iti ##zer and masks were available , and room service was only upon request . Water bottles were provided in the lobby , and while the restaurant was busy even for to - go orders , it was delicious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Land mark hotel opposite Grant Park and in a good location for South of the river / Loop . The hotel is huge but the room was spacious and well set out . You do feel a bit anonymous amongst the crowds of folk in the lobby . The lobby shop was a good source of coffee and snack ##s . Breakfast round the co ##r er at Yo ##lk was good . The hotel is near the red line subway . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family has been coming to downtown Chicago for a night of seeing the lights , enjoying the start of the holiday season at the Chicago Hilton on 720 S . Michigan . The tree at the Hilton is just Beautiful ! We have a party of 40 so many rooms are booked for our Sa ##t . over ##ning ##ht stay ##l At check in Julius Do ##xy was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting for us being on the same floor as much as possible . My room had a f ##abulous view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier , very very nice room . As usual the kids enjoyed the pool and stay at this great , family friendly , hotel . Thanks Hilton ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent . Hotel was outstanding and staff very helpful . Room was very large and beds really comfortable . Only complaint was price of car parking which was 70 $ a night and v ##alet parking . The car lot was approximately 2 blocks away which meant could not car was not easily accessible . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A few weeks ago my wife and I planned a get ##away weekend to the city by booking a room with a king sized bed . To my surprise our sit ##ter had to cancel as we were on our way to the hotel . We didn ' t want to lose out on our paid hotel room . So my wife went home to get the kids and I went to the hotel . I met Ke ##enan at guest service , and explained my story . I asked him if there was any way I can get a room with a door separating my kids sleeping area and ours . My kids go to bed at 7 , us much later . Ke ##enan offered up not just a suite to us , the Executive Suite for a small additional fee . When the rest of my family arrived they were e ##cs ##tat ##ic . Everyone slept well that weekend and enjoyed the awesome views ! Thanks Ke ##enan for helping us out big time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bed is super comfortable . Spa is great and views of Mill ##eni ##um Park and Lake Michigan are gorgeous ! I love staying at this property for work . Not too big so that you feel swallowed up by size and number of guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were lucky to receive an older room with a double bathroom , which was really special for my granddaughter and me . This is located in a great place of Chicago , near a number of fun things to do . I ' d recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in the center of the magnificent mile , great restaurants and food . The restaurant on site is also very good . I was surprised at the rooms . The last time I was here they were dated , but the hotel has had a total renovation and the rooms are great . This is one of the better smaller bout ##ique hotels in the City . I attended a small conference here and the employees were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only thing good about this hotel was the view . The food is NAS ##TY ! ! ! Coffee is supposedly Star ##bu ##cks but it was in ##ed ##ible . The staff in the coffee shop ( Market ) were rude and impatient . They have no fridge in the rooms . They charge $ 75 / night for incident ##als ( put a hold on my card for $ 1800 ) for 1 week stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a nice 2 night stay at the Talbot ##t Hotel . We have 3 young kids and the central location was perfect to explore the city for a couple days . I would absolutely stay again for a couple ' s trip . I might try somewhere else next time with kids . The rate we booked advertised summer happy hour for kids with cool treats , so I thought the hotel cater ##ed to kids . We did not see anything like this during our trip . The restaurant and bar seemed really nice but not the best with young kids . We really enjoyed the stay overall . We saw the A ##qua ##rium , the Zoo , Millennium park etc . We liked being able to walk out to many restaurants around the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is massive ! It is very modern and clean with large rooms . There is a shop , restaurants , coffee shop , gym and much more all on site . If needed , on the 4th floor there is a cheap laundry room . The b ##uff ##et breakfast has a great choice of food . A great hotel and I would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was a little worn . Our room felt a little tired and not super clean . Front desk was very nice ! Location is nice and able to walk all over downtown . Happy hour and breakfast to go was a nice touch . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My son was getting married and our new family was from Europe and Canada We booked 5 rooms and our stay was great . The staff was very good , our rooms were great , restaurant was very good . Overall our time at O ##m ##ni Chicago was a success [SEP]
1	[CLS] Re ##com ##mand ##ation : book parking with Best ##P ##ark ##ing app . Just outside of the large downtown area , this h ##ô ##tel is 10 min ##s walk to the ha ##nco ##ck Tower . Personnel is kind . I had a corner room with a ma ##gni ##fica ##nt view of the Lake and City . Room was clean and spacious . H ##ô ##tel is near a subway station . I would book there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 5 nights on vacation with 2 other couples . We all bought a pro ##mo package about the same time . M ##Y reservation was made a few days later and the ' executive suite " offerings were gone , We had a nice standard room with a really nice view . Of the two other couples , who both booked " executive suites " , one got a very junior suite and the other got a really big suite with lots if extra ##s , so keep in mind that " suite " is a very broad description . We all enjoyed our stay and had a great time exploring Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got what I thought was a great deal on a junior suite in downtown Chicago ( $ 200 per night ) . The room was very comfortable with a great bathroom , excellent toilet ##ries and very good linen ##s . Service throughout the stay with the staff on the street in particular being outstanding . Location is excellent , right I the middle of the city with lots of options for breakfast and dinner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My three boys and I enjoyed our trip to Chicago staying at the O ##m ##ni which is central ##ly located and has all the amenities you ' d expect including a large work ##out area , pool and spa . The staff was very a ##cco ##mo ##dating . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got a King Room with city / view and it was worth it every penny . The bed was extremely com ##fy , breakfast was delicious and staff were out of this world ! ! ! Check in and check out were fast and easy . The location is excellent . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great hotel . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located in downtown Chicago , the staff was very friendly and helpful , and the de ##cor and style is very high end and s ##wan ##ky . On top of the p ##rim ##o accommodation ##s there is a social hour every night in the lobby where they pour free Pro ##se ##cco . Can ’ t go wrong with that ! Bar served great drinks and in the morning had a free coffee and tea setup . Room ##s were relatively small , especially the bathroom , but more than enough for vacation or business stay . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stood at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago for two nights to celebrate my birthday . The corner room we reserved exceeded our expectations ! The views were just gorgeous ! ! The morning started out rainy and wind ##y , and I wouldn ' t have minded just laying around in the comfortable bed just looking out the window . The sun ended up coming out and we made our way out . The location is within walking distance of Michigan Avenue , State Street . Lots and lots of shopping and things to do within walking distance . We had drinks at the bar , but the Palm ##s Restaurant was being re ##mo ##del ##ed . This was okay as there are lots of good places to eat in the City . Very nice place to stay ! I would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our awesome experience began at check in with the exceptional customer service provided by Q ##ui ##ance . He really made us fell welcomed and from here our expectations were exceeded . The suite and two queen bed rooms were beautiful . The beauty and el ##egan ##ce of the rooms were only exceeded by the screams of excitement of my 16 year old and her three companions as they entered their suite ! The rooms were imp ##ec ##ca ##ble and the staff were court ##eous and efficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in a nice area at walking distance from many of Chicago ' s highlights . ( i . e . , 20 minutes walking in several directions ) . The neighborhood feels very safe although a bit boring . My room looked s ##ty ##lish and had a great comfortable bed . The room lo ##oe ##d out on a brick wall which meant that is was dark even when the sun was shining outside ! Small negative is that there was no hot water to shower on my last day there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Inc ##red ##ible location , incredible staff , great de ##cor . Thanks Rachel for making our vacation a memorable one . I will be staying at Kim ##pton again and will definitely recommend All ##egro to friends and family [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a luxury hotel located in the Gold Coast area of Chicago , a short U ##ber ride to downtown , and walking distance to many great restaurants and attractions . The hotel has a very comfortable bar and an excellent French - American restaurant with a lovely outdoor terrace . Service is pro ##mpt , court ##eous and knowledge ##able . I wish they ' d replace the N ##es ##press ##o machine in the rooms with a Ke ##uri ##g , but that ' s a matter of personal preference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chicago Downtown O ##m ##ni on N Michigan is our favorite hotel for a professional convention . Price ##y but worth the cost . Suite ##s a nice touch as is the pre ##break ##fast in room compliment ##ary coffee and juice . Clean room and friendly staff Restaurant not the best choice with so many other excellent choices within walking distance [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Public is a great place to stay especially for the price . The location is awesome - it is within walking distance of lots to see and do in Chicago . The staff was great . I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the best thing about this hotel is the location - very safe and also close to many important sighs ##ts ##ee ##ing spots . Also perfect for the business trip . Room was very big , I was surprised ! very nice view from the room as well , I was on one of the highest floors and looking outside the window was w ##ow ! ) fast check ##in and check ##out , friendly staff . mini ##bar a bit expensive , even still water is really over ##p ##rice ##s - but that would be the only disadvantage . otherwise , my next time in Chicago I will be staying here again , no doubt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Park ##ing was a has ##sle with walking so far from the room . Room was amazing we had a lake view room . Hotel was very clean everything worked perfectly . Some of the staff were not very nice other staff was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Except ##ional service from all parties , well - appointed & spacious rooms , great location . The con ##cier ##ge was particularly helpful . The Fair ##mont Gold was worth the extra expense . It was a great stay for my family , and we will be staying there when we return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The breakfast is wonderful and the breakfast staff is very polite . The beds are very comfortable , my husband wants to buy a mattress from them . The location is ideal for everything we do when we come to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for four nights in September . Friendly staff , lovely breakfast , comfortable bed etc . However I was a bit disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations but see further . Also appreciated the fact that the room had an opening window . Very well located with all Chicago inner City sites near by . I cannot it five because it ’ s an old hotel in need of throwing off as much of its do ##w ##dy finish as possible in rooms and corridors etc . Thanks for a pleasant stay however . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . King suite is worth the extra $ . Free breakfast , evening cocktail ##s , nice staff . I spend a lot of time ( sometimes too much ) on looking up hotels . This is a great one to just book and be done . Will be a go - to place next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing array of br ##unch options ; you can make your own o ##mel ##ette and pan ##cakes , many choices of past ##ries , fresh fruit , cereal ##s , toast , sa ##usage ##s , bacon , br ##oil ##ed vegetables , coffee , tea . Benito was so helpful and kind , making sure we were taken care of . High ##ly recommend eating br ##unch at the hotel ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was very nice . The beds were super comfortable and the room was spacious . Every staff member I encountered treated me with courtesy and respect . The location was also te ##rri ##fic and we were able to walk to nearby shopping and attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Plus : Good location , handy parking area and v ##alet , no ##stal ##gic building . Good - sized rooms and closet . We had a family suite with a large closet . Min ##us : We arrived to a lo ##oo ##ong check - in que ##ue on Wednesday evening . There were 2 weddings and 2 conventions at that time . We waited 30 ##mins plus the extra time it took to actually check - in . Our room was in a mid - storey level facing Michigan Avenue . It is V ##ER ##Y noisy - traffic , people shouting in the street at night , plus the roar of the train passing by every 5 - 10 ##mins . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Thank you to Barry Son ##der ##n and his exceptional staff ( Ha ##ke ##em , Medina , Cassandra and teams ) for another great experience at O ##m ##ni Chicago Hotel . We have been loyal O ##m ##ni guests for over 20 years , and would not consider anything other than O ##m ##ni Chicago . We are looking forward to our next stay this fall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Except for the cold room ( p ##oss due to old configuration of h ##va ##c ) it was just about as good as it could get . No heat vent in the bathroom . Room was very comfortable & clean . All staff members we had contact with were friendly , polite , helpful , and lots of other positive ##s . Heard lots of sire ##ns due to the close ##ness of a hospital , but don ' t think they woke me up . Must have gotten used to them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect in every sense of the word . Bed was amazing as was the 65 inch TV . The location was excellent for us as it was close to Eat ##aly and other locations we wanted to experience . The upstairs bar was cool both in style and temperature . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 3 night in the ta ##l ##bot ##t hotel . The room was spacious and it had an excellent bed . The staff was very friendly and helpful ##l . Our room was located on the 8th floor , giving out on an alley . Unfortunately it was quite noisy , but ok . E ##ar ##p ##lug ##s do miracles . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was very cool to have the bar and food available in the s ##me building . The waiter ##s must have been under ##sta ##ffed or just not very at ##ten ##tive , however , they were polite . Also a gentleman outside was able to get us a taxi late . Very cool . Overall I would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I booked here as an anniversary get away ! We were able to check in early , the staff was so very friendly and our room was amazing ! My husband had already coordinated a large floral delivery as a surprise and the staff was so helpful ! We will stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were thrilled with the location , close to museums , and the architectural boat tour . Sheila had great suggestions on eating , listening to music and na ##vi ##gating the city . The front desk was court ##eous and helpful . The wine in the lobby at the end of the day provided an opportunity to meet other people . The rooms were spot ##less and well appointed . We would definitely return to the hotel and recommend it to others . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great stay , I was there for just one night in between a he ##ctic schedule and I had the best sleep in a long time ! ! The bed was divine and I was almost ready to miss my flight for some extra sleep : P ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at the All ##egro for the first time this past weekend for a weekend get away in Chicago . The hotel had been recently updated in a class ##y Art Dec ##o motif . . Our room was very nice , comfortable , and spacious . Staff was very professional and polite . When in the city , we stay at Kim ##pton Properties because of their excellent customer service and accommodation ##s and the All ##egro did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been to large metro cities and stayed in many smaller hotel rooms . This is one of the smallest and least er ##gon ##omi ##cal ##ly designed I ’ ve ever seen . The closet was about 6 inches deep ( you had to have the hang ##ers hang on a diagonal plane ) . There was no way to stand square in front of the sink because the toilet sat s ##nu ##g against the counter . There was about one square foot of counters ##pace ( maybe less ) in the bathroom . The sink , though pretty , was terribly designed and it was almost impossible to even wash your hands . I am glad my reservation was for only two days , because I actually found myself getting quite a ##gg ##ra ##vated by the accommodation ##s . On the bright side , the lobby area , bar and restaurant were quite nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I highly recommend staying here with a small family especially on a visit to the American girl store ! They brought the cute ##st beds to our room for the dolls to sleep in ! Having a full sized fridge , microwave and a separate bedroom is exactly what you need when traveling with little ones ! Nice breakfast options and snack ##s before dinner ! We would stay here again and again ! Front door staff and front desk staff went above and beyond daily ! Price ##s were a little spike ##d due to la ##lap ##alo ##oz ##a going on . Price ##s dropped tremendous ##ly the day we left [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is perfect , we were literally in the heart of it all . The corner bakery cafe and G ##hir ##ade ##llis are right nearby . We had so many places to chose from to shop and eat . A lovely stay , my only complaint is the lack of a regular pool and no hot tub . The lap pool isn ' t designed to just hang out in with the kids . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great . Hotel is very nice . But . . . parking is $ 71 per night ? With the lame excuse it ' s a third party ? The restaurant down the street negotiate ##s overnight parking for $ 21 ! ! ! So you arrive tired from a day of traveling and the they sting you for the parking ! Then also , the shower has no pressure at all . It ' s nothing but a water ##y d ##rip . So I guess I should have gone to the Y ##MCA for a shower and to park . No way . It ' s a four star Holiday Inn but a one star Inter ##con ##n . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for an overnight shopping trip downtown . We were greeted warmly by the v ##alet at the front door . Pro ##ce ##eding to the front desk we were checked in by Gerry who was highly at ##ten ##tive to our every need . What a cool location ( about a block off Michigan ) ; fantastic rooms ; heavenly beds ; and generous continental breakfast and compliment ##ary cocktail ##s from 5 to 8 pm . Even worked out in a well equipped work ##out room . T ##rem ##end ##ous location ; friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff ; very clean and ups ##cale rooms ; perfect in every way ! ! This place is a g ##em ! ! Make your next reservation here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , dog friendly , great people , beautiful buildings , incredible rooms and views that grace post ##cards world wide . But the food at the Palm for dinner is still and always has been a very poor way to spend $ 300 . Go on St Patrick ' s Saturday and you have the perfect view of a green river . Go on Marathon weekend and watch the runners pass by . Go over Christmas and Believe in the Spirit of the season , with Santa in the Pen ##thouse . Did you know he stays at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago when South of home - and who wouldn ' t ? Go any summer weekend and realize why Chicago is a special place and truly one of a kind . Fantastic work out room ( no pool ) . And now - my biggest tip - you ready ? Get an ' 04 ' room above the 30th floor . Trust me on this . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We actually stayed at the other Hilton but visited the Palmer House with out friends that stayed there . We had to go to see the beauty of this building and try their famous brown ##ie that was invented there in 1893 . Even though we just went in for a brown ##ie we were treated like we were guests . I would say it is worth stopping in and having a brown ##ie and admire the beautiful building . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the location and am ##bian ##ce of this contemporary bout ##ique hotel ! The check in was easy . The front desk was friendly and very helpful the entire weekend . Love ##d the text feature this hotel uses to keep in touch and help us with anything we needed . The rooms were really clean . I personally loved that they provided a black towel labeled “ makeup ” for us ladies . If you like having a bar in your hotel this would be a down ##side to this hotel but the 5 pm F ##RE ##E Happy Hour with beer and wine was definitely a bonus . Not having a bar in the hotel was not a big deal for us because we like going out and trying different bars . I would highly recommend this bout ##ique hotel for a quick weekend to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel nicely located . Really adapted for a family visit with its kitchen space . Style is simple and no f ##uss . The hotel lobby is one floor up from the street . Breakfast b ##uff ##et and afternoon b ##uff ##et included [SEP]
1	[CLS] The night manager Art ##uto made my visit so wonderful . He took extra time to make sure I had a great room and then sent me additional amenities ! I will be returning t ##p the Kim ##pton every ##time I am in Chicago . The coffee bar every morning was great . Can ##t wait to come back and experience the cocktail hour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal was perfect , walked Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . . . and to Soldier Field for Bears Game ! Great location and the only opportunity is it was a little bit hard to get into Vale ##t Park ##ing as street so busy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The interior architecture is wonderful . The entrance lobby and staircase ##s to the grand ballroom are stunning with the amount of detail throughout . We took the time to take the " Witness the moments tour " , J ##ac ##inda was our tour guide , she was kind and helpful and provided the rich history that the hotel has to offer . Our room had a great view of Grant Park and of lake Michigan We look forward to returning someday . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el was recommended to me by a colleague and want an excellent stay it was . The property was beautiful and the location was great . The extra bonus was the amazing staff . From house ##keeping to front desk everyone was friendly and welcoming . Morgan the con ##cier ##ge was a rock star . Being a native New York we spoke about back home and P ##I ##Z ##Z ##A of course ! She gave me some awesome recommendations and I was so impressed of her knowledge considering she is still fairly new to the area . I can not wait to return and try more of Morgan ##s recommendations . I will also be recommend ##ing the hotel to so many of my colleagues . Thank you So ##fit ##el . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is very ideal . Easy walk from everything . Park ##ing is average / somewhat less than comparable hotels . The only complaint was that the mini fridge didn ’ t have room for anything but their sale items and that the toilet ##ries were nothing fancy ( small s ##ham ##po ##o / condition and transparent toilet paper ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] My overall experience at the Talbot ##t was excellent . I had a couple of minor room issues but they were taken care of ex ##ped ##iti ##ously and corrected to my satisfaction . Everyone I dealt with , from Charles the door ##man to the front desk to house ##keeping and engineering were excellent . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wow . We haven ' t had customer service like this in quite some time , and we travel frequently . S ##pect ##ac ##ular from start to finish . . . bell ##man to check out . It was a nice touch to receive text messages each day to see if we needed anything . When we did have a question one night , the staff responded within 5 minutes . . . awesome . The pre - check - in , select your room feature was te ##rri ##fic and unexpected . G ##lam ##orous , spot ##less hotel , wonderful staff , comfortable beds , wonderful shower ##s , spot ##less house ##keeping , efficient elevators . Would definitely recommend , and we will be staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ya ##vis Soto made me feel so special & blessed . As you can see in the note " attached below " her words made my day . If you are ever in Chicago make sure you stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l and please say hello to Ya ##vis from me . She ' s amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here for a professional conference . The room was nicely furnished . The hotel staff members were exceptionally helpful for several aspects of our stay . They had a nice selection of eating options in the hotel and close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the property and the v ##ibe . Bo ##uti ##que hotels of this type live hard so maintenance and up ##ke ##ep are key to maintaining the level of experience . Other than a little obvious wear and tear the hotel is still a g ##em , and can ' t be beat for the balance of style and value . Always a great choice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this lovely hotel for 4 nights . The service was great and the rooms were clean . Special mention : the bed and the pillows were divine . . . I travel with my pillow because of neck pain issues but the bed ##ding at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is by far the best I have experienced in a while . The breakfast restaurant , The Nix , had a great selection for breakfast but I think a few times the kitchen was overwhelmed because it took over 20 minutes to get a bowl of o ##at ##me ##al . Also only one person was waiting on tables while two others were simply clearing , which was f ##rust ##rating for guests who kept asking to be assisted and were told " He will be with you shortly " . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You ’ re not getting the 5 star hotel this place is cracked up to be . Honestly , not the best experience . The t ##v was broken , view was awful ( after I “ upgraded ” my room ) , room right by the elevators , it was an extremely average experience at best . Used co ##vid as an excuse for a lot of the lack ##luster experiences you expect in a “ 5 - star ” hotel . You ’ re much better going somewhere else . Save some money . Please , if you ’ re an average Joe , trying to take your significant other out on a romantic weekend listen to me . This is not the place for you . Save your money you can get somewhere much better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful room and hotel . The service is much to be desired . Not rude , but not what you ' d expect at a luxury property . The rooms , beautiful hotel , and comfortable beds compensate for the service for sure . I booked 3rd party , which may be why the service isn ' t great . At check out , they applied a $ 20 resort fee , but you ' re not told what ' s it ' s for . I do not like properties that nickel and dim ##e you with mi ##s ##cell ##aneous fees just for the sake of it . If you charge resort fees , make sure you let the guest know what the fee includes and how to easily enjoy the benefit she . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We hosted a Board of Directors meeting there . The banquet Super ##visor James Jenkins was awesome . He made sure that he checked in with us to see if we needed anything . He made our event fl ##aw ##less . Thanks James nice working with you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay at the Monaco every Thanksgiving weekend . We love it ' s location , it ' s wine hour and the co ##zy rooms overlooking the river . I will say the hotel use to be more fun with massage ##s and fortune telling during wine hour . I wish they would bring that back ! They also need to get better Christmas decorations , they p ##ail in compassion to the other hotels . I hope they read this message and improve for this year ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed in the Palmer house on arrival the reception and bar areas are very beautiful . The reception staff were friendly and she very kindly upgraded our room but we were very disappointed with size of the rooms and especially the bathroom this was very small and very dated . The Palmer house is located in the loop and is in a great location easy access to everything . Overall an ok stay but would not return [SEP]
1	[CLS] up - graded without cost to a room with a view - all amenities were great for our group of 20 lawyers and their wives from across the US - nice birthday greeting for my wife - staff was very nice and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Staff , service and location . Walls are a little thin for hallway noise , but overall a great place to stay with great parking and luggage storage options . They have a v ##alet option that exceeds check out by 5 hours allowing you to keep your car parked while you continue to explore the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Old building . Dec ##or ##é in the lobby area is so beautiful and feel of nice n classic hotel . Updated room with huge TV but still old and small . My room was facing other rooms inside so had to have the d ##rap ##es closed the whole time . Hotel staff r very professional greet me with smile . Location is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 5 days here July 3 - 8 . Upon arrival , somehow our online reservations had not gone through . Emily at front desk was S ##O helpful in getting reservation straightened out with credit card and hotel . V ##ER ##Y patient and V ##ER ##Y helpful ! Also John the door man was V ##ER ##Y helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting after we realized at 1 ##pm that our tickets to Hamilton were the mat ##ine ##e at 1 : 30 and not the night performance . John helped us get a cab and had the cab wait for us while we changed so we could get to Hamilton on time . Location was great , able to catch tour buses on corner , Navy Pier , Ma ##g Mile was a short walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were finishing a multi stay trip to the States and Chicago was our last stop . The Monaco is in a great spot , close to the river , Millie ##nium Park , Art Institute and a short walk to all the major shops . Our room was nicely furnished with q ##ui ##rky animal print robes , a great hair dye ##r and nice toilet ##ries . The staff were really helpful . Especially Rich on the con ##cier ##ge desk . He sorted out our river cruise and gave us lots of helpful tips . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary wine and ni ##bble ##s served between 5 and 6 is a nice touch . Re ##ception also quickly solved our tooth ##pas ##te shortage problem immediately . All in all I would stay here again . Nice bout ##ique hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ing in Chicago with a baby and to ##ddler in the b ##list ##ering cold can present a challenge . The staff at this hotel made everything so easy ! Beautiful de ##cor , comfortable beds , and great location . Close to an el with an elevator for s ##tro ##llers . Thanks for your hospitality ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location within walking distance to everything . Room ##s were much bigger than expected . Staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful . D ##wayne was wonderful and helped us with parking and our bags . He gave recommendations for restaurants and local attractions . He made our stay wonderful . [SEP]

1	[CLS] We stay here every year at Christmas time . Great location , great old hotel . The lobby is a treasure in downtown Chicago . Great amenities , including Potter ' s Bar , shops , a Star ##bu ##cks , and lots of great restaurants nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s a very comfortable hotel . The breakfast which was included with our group was excellent , as well as the staff at the Columbus Ta ##p in the hotel . we ate there both mornings and late night . Location is G ##RE ##AT [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our tenth meeting at the Talbot ##t - our business group comes every summer . Just an excellent place to stay - friendly , small enough to get around easily . Great location as well in the Loop . Bar and restaurant excellent as well [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came for a 24 hour business trip . Check in was quick and smooth , didn ’ t go down for the managers drink special but it looked nice . Room is standard size for Chicago or NYC . The bed was so comfortable ! I forgot my hair straight ##ener , called downstairs and had one at my door in 5 minutes ! ! I would come back again if I ’ m here on business . Really great per ##k having Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel ground floor for the early morning meetings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If I had received a true Lake ##view room , which costs extra , the review would be higher . This location has a de ##ceptive practice of label ##ing rooms as lake ##view that do not face the lake - 2 windows faced west ( away from lake ) and 1 faced south with a view of a high rise building ( if you stood in the corner of the room and peered out at a certain angle you could see a s ##li ##ver of the lake ) . If you do not care about the Lake ##view or actually get an east facing view , this location is very good - walking distance to the museum campus , theaters , restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the O ##M ##NI Hotel were at ##ten ##tive and friendly . Upon check in the staff noted that we had a birthday girl in our group . They delivered a beautiful and delicious dessert and bottle of wine ( chilled ) to our room while we were out . What a wonderful surprise ! ! The location is perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was booked for two nights but as a result of • elevator was out of service • room smelled of smoke • blood stain on outlet cover • ceiling plaster p ##eel ##ing • f ##ray ##ed edges on couch cushion • disco ##lora ##tion beside toilet • slamming doors I left early in the morning . Being herd ##ed on a packed to capacity elevator in CO ##VI ##D season was alarm ##ing . I brought my concerns to the front desk . They tried to accommodate me but enough was enough . I definitely want my money back for this horrible stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super ##b hotel . Very very comfortable beds and pillows . The only thing I can find fault with is the noisy fan on the air condition ##er . I only ate once in the hotel restaurant - the food was wonderful , though a little on the ' no ##uve ##lle cuisine ' side . The bar has a good range of bottle ##d and draft beers , as well as all the usual cocktail ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband , 7 year old and myself recently spent the weekend at the O ##m ##ni . I dislike convention hotels and the more ups ##cale bout ##ique hotel like the O ##m ##ni is ideal . Upon entering the suite , I carefully examined the bed for unwanted guests and they were clean . The staff was friendly and helpful . This property is suitable for both business travelers and those who wish for some R & R . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for business . The hotel is fantastic in terms of options for restaurants on - site or in the area ( I did not go to any on - site ) . It ’ s in the center of a lot of different attractions within walking distance or a quick U ##ber / L ##y ##ft / taxi ride . Fitness center was good size and accommodate ##d my work ##out needs . Room ##s have food / beverages for purchase . I actually hate this feature but can understand why hotels provide it . Be mind ##ful if you don ’ t want extra charges . You can not use the fridge for personal items . If I went back for business , I would love to stay here again . If I came to town with my family , I ’ d look for a more family friendly hotel that included a pool ( and no charge ##able food in the rooms ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed the experience . Great centralized location , friendly and helpful staff , and a clean room . I enjoyed the ability to get to Lakes ##hore and all of the meetings around the city with ease , and the re ##c room was top notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our son got married at the Intercontinental Hotel and the venue was outstanding . I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning an event . The staff was outstanding in all aspects , and our event coordinator was top - notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I spent a night at the Conrad . Were in town to see Hamilton . Hotel was in a great location and very luxurious . The best part was the service from the staff . We are fairly laid back but they were helpful with anything we needed . Check - in and check - out were efficient . Great bar in the 20th story lobby . Beautiful views during both the day and night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at this location more than once for business . Each time I feel the quality doesn ’ t live up to the price . Most recently , I arrived at 4 : 30 p . m . and they didn ’ t have any rooms clean or available for check - in . Ad ##ding low customer service to me ##dio ##cre room quality at a premium price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for our first visit to Chicago and chose this hotel based on reviews , d ##é ##cor , etc . We absolutely loved our stay here . The d ##é ##cor of the hotel is very cool , and the staff could not be more friendly or a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Other reviews mentioned the thin walls , but that was not our experience . The noise level that we heard was similar to other hotels and not an issue , and the hotel was sold out . We would love to stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was perfect , and location was ideal for getting to and from the race and walking to top tourist spots . Room was lovely and restaurants / bars were exactly what we were looking for . Looking forward to my next visit . Thank you ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had an unexpected 2 week work stay at The Talbot ##t Hotel and the staff was ex ##tro ##dina ##ry ! From the moment I entered this cute , ups ##cale , modern style hotel they were thoughtful , helpful and at ##ten ##tive . When the front desk realized i missed my birthday party because of work they sent up a card and champagne . The con ##sie ##rges were knowledge ##able and helpful . My room was car ##fully maintained and the door ##men are exceptional , friendly and court ##eous . Every ##time I encountered a staff member they were friendly and e ##aga ##r to help . This is a bout ##ique hotel with a top notch staff who pays attention to detail ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is well laid out for large conventions . I liked the spa ##cing of the different bars & restaurants . Very close to the river tours & other tourist attractions . The room was just right & the views are wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Older hotel , showing its age if you look closely . Fortunately , most of us don ' t . The rooms have been nicely updated and are very quiet . The staff are exactly what you want in an ups ##cale hotel downtown , friendly , professional and helpful . Bed ##ding is good . If you need firm pillows ask at check - in . El ##eva ##tors are small by modern standards ( fortunate ##ly there are three ) but pretty fast . I will go back if I am in Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I thought this was a really good hotel in a really nice area it ' s on the ma ##g mile close to all of the shops and restaurants , really close to CT ##A . I would ask to not be on the floor of the pool because the smell of ch ##lor ##ine is extremely strong you can smell it right when the elevator hits the 5th floor and the doors haven ' t even opened yet . The staff doesn ' t really go above and beyond for anything , they do what they have to do that ' s very basic like extra towels but it ' s nothing super special . This hotel is mostly just for the location for a fairly decent price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got a great deal for the Fair ##mont on Hot ##wire . We spent 3 days here on the way to St . Louis . Right from check in to every other experience the staff was amazing and the hotel as well . The room was so comfortable and clean and we almost didn ’ t want to leave to experience the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You wanna know what excellent service is ? 3 words . The . Ambassador . Hotel . Specifically , B ##re at the front desk was a guardian angel sent to us to create the most spectacular Chicago experience possible for our group of 3 . In fact , Like the hotel ’ s name , she was the perfect ambassador for the people of Chicago . Nice , friendly , in the know , and full of ch ##aris ##ma . Please - for those looking to visit this incredible hotel , ask to meet B ##re . She will ensure you have a fantastic time . Thank you Ambassador Hotel . Thank you B ##re . We can ’ t wait until we see you again ! - Chase [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel stay was Very good to excellent — this survey is annoying ##ly long and o ##b ##no ##xious . My check in with the front desk as always was very good at ##ten ##tive and very court ##eous . Con ##cier ##ge friendly and at ##ten ##tive , accommodation ##s such a great value . . . . clean , comfortable [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful restoration since I was last here over 30 years ago . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located in the heart of the loop , close access to the Art Institute and Symphony Hall . A 10 minute U ##ber ride from the United Center ( go Black ##hawks ! ) and a block away from the Re ##s and Blue lines . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited for just a quick trip to see family friends . Room ##s were smaller but nicely set up bathroom ##s we typical hotel size . We had I believe a hospitality suite with a table for six so we could entertain friends . We had a great stay and wonderful hospitality like we do at most O ##m ##ni properties . They have a great selection of food ( room service is available ) and were a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our all ##er ##gy kid . It was a great deal for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I stayed for the weekend . The rooms were clean , beds very comfortable and front desk was kind . Unfortunately due to Co ##vid Michael Jordan ’ s was closed . The hotel was quiet . We did not used the fitness spa or pool , but it looked amazing ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our family of four loved our three night stay at Kim ##pton Hotel Mona ##ce Chicago , the hotel certainly exceeded our expectations . All of the staff we met were very friendly and the location of the hotel is close to most attractions in Chicago . We were surprised on our first night with a personal ##ized note welcoming us to the hotel along with some great beer , snack ##s and drinks for the kids . As mentioned many times in reviews , our daughter loved the large window seat overlooking the river . When visiting Chicago , our choice will always be Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is across the street from The Drake . It ex ##udes a lovely , sophisticated , Chicago meets Park Avenue ( upper crust , New York ) type of atmosphere . Especially in the lobby bar / lounge area . The rooms are nicely decorated & comfortable ( some are on the small side , being a vintage building . But still pleasant ) . It ' s located in a convenient area & makes for a quiet ##er setting for both tourists & business travelers . It makes a nice refuge after a long , t ##iring day . The door ##men / bell ##men , house ##keeping & desk staff are helpful & welcoming . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I will definitely visit this p ##osh , beautiful hotel again . From the moment we stepped into the gorgeous lobby , we were impressed . As we approached the reception desk , we were greeted by Eric ’ s warm , friendly and professional demeanor . He made a great first impression of this property . Our room was spot ##less , modern and very well appointed with robes , slip ##pers , Ke ##uri ##g machine and a super com ##fy bed ! Bath ##room is spacious and class ##y ! Mike , our door ##man , was also very friendly and helpful which just added to our positive feelings for this hotel . We highly recommend staying here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] As soon we walked in the room we noticed a really bed smell . Even the cleaning lady and the guys bringing our luggage ##s admitted there was a bed smell . Tri ##ed calling the reception - no answer . The cleaning lady spray ##ed something on the carpet but that helped fi ##r only few minutes . The hotel in general is old . You cannot open any windows and so we had to stay with air condition on all night just fi ##r the bed smell . We were there fi ##r a wedding and so did not spend much time in the room . Still I could not recommend thus hotel to anyone . Really disappointed because it is a H ##Y ##AT ##T and also p ##ric ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came to have breakfast with my daughter . We were ignored for 10 min . Then we looked in the other room . There was one person helping there but it was only for v ##ou ##chers . So he said there is a b ##uff ##et behind the bar and you have to check in with the bartender . Bart ##ender gave us a menu and we sat for 10 more minutes and left . Zero waits ##ta ##ff . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was incredible The staff was above a ##cco ##m . The room was quiet and respected our privacy . Little extra ##s like the robes and amazing marble shower made this worth the price . This hotel has the most incredible bed ever ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the price , location , and weekday evening social as well as the compliment ##ary breakfast . Also handy to have the full kitchen ##ette . Vale ##t parking is very price ##y so we reserved a parking garage in town for a third of the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 2 nights here but could have easily stayed longer , it was like being home . the room was large and very inviting . the main bed was very comfortable but the sofa bed was not so the kids ended up putting the mattress on the floor . the kitchen was large although it did not supply cut ##ler ##y or plates . the bathroom also was a good size but needed better lighting for applying make up . Every guest is given drinks token so you can enjoy pre dinner drinks in the hotel bar / restaurant which was a nice touch and great for people watching . Breakfast was good , a nice range of food but i don ' t get the paper cups for coffee , some of us like to sit and relax . lots of places to eat nearby too . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Amazing . The place was clean , the staff was pro ##mpt , the location was in the middle of everything that we needed to get to . I was very grateful for the working crew and positive energy that we were treated with . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room , excellent bed providing high comfort . A lot of amenities in the bathroom . H ##ô ##tel is very quiet and has an excellent location . Very close to the shops , restaurant and the lake for those who enjoy running outside . Fitness center is nice as well with a lot of equipment ##s . staff in the restaurant is average ( morning breakfast ) Other staff is friendly and very efficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great 1 night stay in Chicago at Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . It was right in the loop , had an easy time pulling in . Used v ##alet to un ##load and park ( it costs 60 ##ish dollars but so does every hotel in the city ) . Every person we encountered at this hotel was super nice . Made it in just in time for our compliment ##ary drink in the lounge . Room ##s were cute modern and clean . Love ##d having a window seat to look out into the city . Great breakfast offering the next morning . Check out wasn ' t til noon so we walked over to Navy Pier and enjoyed the morning . We will for sure stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here many times . The service is excellent , the suite - style accommodation ##s are perfect , and the location is the best on Michigan Avenue . The staff is always polite and helpful . It ' s a fantastic value for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] El ##egan ##ce and comfort . We enjoyed the historical importance of the Palmer , the exquisite de ##cor , and the modern comfort ##s this hotel had to offer . We had breakfast included with out stay . Very class ##y breakfast . Best pan ##cakes I have ever had . High ##ly recommended the Palmer to anyone wanting memorable get ##away . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have loved staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie . The hotel is nice , Swan ##ky , and clean . And the happy hour is great ##ness . Josh took care of us . And he is a rocks ##tar ! ! ! ! We weren ’ t sure what to expect . But have been so happy with our choice to stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two nights with my family of 4 . The room was spacious and very clean . Staff from start to finish was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Bell ##man D ##wayne e ##pit ##omi ##zes great customer service and is one of the big the reasons we will be back . Great value , service , and really a great location if you are looking to hit up all the great spots in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I normally stay at the So ##fit ##el . The hotel is clean . The staff is pleasant and competent and the location is te ##rri ##fic . However on this stay there was a problem with my bill . I filled out the hotel satisfaction survey when I returned home thinking I was wasting my time but to my surprise I received an email and three subsequent phone calls from the leadership at the hotel to resolve my problem . It was quickly resolved and I am delighted that this hotel takes customer satisfaction so seriously . A rare and welcome characteristic in today ’ s business world . They have my loyalty and I will always choose So ##fit ##el first . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My company recommended this hotel . It is a classic hotel that has a great restaurant . they had some g ##lut ##en free options for breakfast and dinner which was nice . The location is convenient and the staff were very helpful in arranging transportation etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I thought the service was great - - everyone from the v ##alet who rushed to open the door whenever i entered the hotel to the front desk staff ( who were kind when I locked myself out ) to the security personnel who assisted our conference attendees with a smile . Soft towels , separate tub and shower , comfortable mattress , toilet behind separate door , super - fast elevators . . . Just a really nice place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our best hotel in downtown Chicago . Close to all major attractions . Restaurant ##s with ta ##sty food . Historic hotel with beautiful interiors . Great breakfast , bar , and dinner . You can get a pass to another Hilton hotel with a pool . Fantastic [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a week over new years eve . Staff were very helpful and friendly . The wine hour each day from 5 ##pm was good fun . Show ##er was a bit annoying and trick ##y to get the correct . Room ##s were nice , beds were big and com ##fy . Take the blue like train from O ' Hare to Clark \ Lake and its a 10 minute walk . I would happily return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in need of a lunch last minute for a client meeting at their A ##ros ##a room . He was a tremendous help ##er and even arranged delivery to the room for me ! He ’ s helped me in years past too and always goes above and beyond ! Thanks Michael ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in Chicago to see a show , and the Kim ##pton All ##egro was perfect for a quick overnight stay in the city . The lobby is beautiful , staff very helpful , beds are com ##fy , and rooms ch ##ic and fun . The rooms are definitely on the small side ( go to the Kim ##pton Gray if you want larger rooms ) , so if you have a more extended stay you may want to look elsewhere . Aside from the room size , everything was just fine . The Pro ##se ##cco happy hour and morning coffee bar are nice touches . We definitely wouldn ' t hesitate to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A lovely bout ##ique - style hotel that ' s a short walk to the train station . A great location just west of Michigan Ave . Con ##ven ##ient for shopping and dining . First class helpful staff ! They got us a reservation at an excellent Italian restaurant for that evening ! Wonderful extra ##s like wine / bites , coffee each morning and mid - afternoon . Although we live in Cincinnati now , we grew up near Chicago and know the city pretty well . To me , this is one of the best values around . We will return ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fast ##est check in ever ! Room was big and elevator wasn ' t grand ##ma slow . First place I ' ve stayed with silk hang ##ers in the closet ! R ##itz ##y ! Staff were so friendly and acted like they all genuinely loved their jobs ! I ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] There are literally hundreds of hotel options in Chicago and when I get to pick , I pick the Palmer House . Hotel rooms and bathroom ##s are not large but I don ’ t care . It ’ s beautiful and special . So much history and close to everything . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I took two of our young granddaughter ##s for a stay at the Hilton to see what a Grand old Chicago hotel looks like . When they saw the block long hotel they where impressed but when they walked into the hotel and saw the hum ##ong ##ous foyer , s ##tai ##r case and Christmas tree their mouths actually dropped open . The staff were all very friendly and helpful . The B ##uff ##et breakfast filled us for hours . The girls had a lot of fun in the pool after walking around town and ice skating at Millennium Park . All in all all four of us enjoyed our time downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in town for a business Conference ( Tu ##e - Sa ##t ) and the hotel is convenient ##ly located near Navy pier , restaurants , and convenient / drug stores . Stay ##ed on the 37th floor overlooking Navy Pier . The hotel has a restaurant , bar , and spa on site with a newly re ##mo ##del ##ed gym on the 43 ##rd floor with a beautiful view . J ##ac ##lyn checked me in and provided me exceptional service with a genuine connection and at ##ten ##tive ##ness . The only thing that could of made this hotel stay better was having a pool , J ##ac ##uz ##zi , and Sa ##una Area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quality room but small , worst bar and room service I have ever had , seems no one is trained in customer service nor cares , lots of I am sorry , but no action , corporate does not seem to care if you have a issue , they give you the front desk to call after you leave , lots better places in Chicago for $ 500 . 00 a night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This isn ' t a small hotel , but it has classic Kim ##pton touches which makes it feel more unique . Con ##ven ##ient location , Star ##bu ##cks next door , and a nearby Pre ##t a Man ##ger . It also has a classic hotel bar next to reception that ' s got top shelf cocktail ##s and the right am ##bie ##nce . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel Monaco in Chicago is like all Kim ##pton hotels - - welcoming , pretty , dog - friendly and wonderful . I don ' t love many companies but I Love Kim ##pton . No breakfast but hotel breakfast ##s suck anyway . Free wine hour instead . Much better idea . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a big hotel , well kept , staff is very good and helpful . The hotel is located on the River and a great view of the bay and river . Next to River walk . The G ##ym is Good but , should be bigger , due o ##t he size of the hotel and the large groups they have . There are times , around 6 AM , there were just too many people and the lack of space . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dear friends , I ' d like to share my experience at my spa at the Fair ##mont Hotel because it was such an amazing experience . I wa ##n to thank N ##ess ##i ( Spa Manager ) because he was able to find a space for my wife and myself very last minute ! It was our anniversary , and we had amazing facial ##s with Alexis and Melissa . All the staff were very friendly to us , and at the end of the day we received some nice presents from the Spa that we were not expecting ; the little details . Thank you so much for the incredible experience guys , you did a fantastic job . [SEP]
1	[CLS] ABS ##OL ##UT ##EL ##Y THE W ##OR ##ST H ##OT ##EL E ##X ##P ##ER ##IE ##NC ##E E ##VE ##R ! ! ! ! We have been coming to Chicago for years and wanted to check out the Palmer House . What a disappointment . It started with the check - in process . The lady with the dye ##d red hair has the worst attitude and the rude ##st staff we have ever encountered . The lobby is loud and smell of alcohol . There is no v ##alet staff for a “ 24 - h ##r v ##alet parking ” . No bell ##men . The hotel front is situated right in the middle of a busy street with dirty front lobby . All these were just the beginning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a classic hotel in downtown Chicago . They ' re currently making renovations as the building is aging . E ##ar ##p ##lug ##s were left in the room but never needed . Free happy hour was nice from 5 - 6 in the evening , especially after a travel day . Co ##mple ##mentary coffee and tea bar in the morning until 10 ##am and a Star ##bu ##cks attached . The room was smaller but as to be expected with an older building . The fitness space was fantastic ! I was travelling with my partner on their business trip so had some extra time to work ##out with all the amenities - rowing machine , free weights , lifting stations , T ##R ##X . Each time I was in the fitness center only 1 - 2 other people were present . I would recommend this hotel especially if you ' re seeing any shows or need quick access to the L . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was very amazed at the level of care . It was well over my expectations . Can ' t wait to visit again . I stayed for 9 nights and enjoyed the rest and relaxation after a Amtrak rail experience which was awesome as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have had a lot of problems with our A - Club membership . We were not able to book the room through this membership , and so likely missed out on a discount . The con ##cier ##ge at the hotel was very helpful and was able to get the stay assigned to our account for points , but it looks like the number of points we have has decreased while we were not able to red ##ee ##m . We love this hotel but find the rewards system hard to work with and have the sense that we have not received what we have earned through loyalty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service at check in by Kane ##fu ##s and Fe ##lic ##ia . They let us know that our room would be very cramped with a roll away , so upgraded us at a very reasonable low cost rate . Love ##d the views from the 14th floor . Hotel was very clean and the location was great . We enjoyed rent ##ing bikes right across the way and being on the river walk was great . I didn ' t appreciate the super small ice bucket ##s , hard to fill a glass or water bottle . And having no extra room in the f ##rig also was not helpful . As with all other hotels , the bathroom and hallway needs more hooks for towels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our favourite hotel in Chicago : great rooms , good food , excellent location and great service . PR ##OS - Love ##d the location : great shopping nearby , had everything we needed , loved that Whole Foods was nearby too - G ##RE ##AT service : un ##p ##ret ##ent ##ious , helpful and welcoming - Love ##d the innovative food concepts at Baptiste & Bo ##ttle and No ##yan ##e - Wonderful rooms , beautifully appointed - Hilton Honors Gold members are recognised and treated well here - with breakfast credit ( or bonus points ) - Sur ##rou ##nding areas felt safe as first time tourists in Chicago We stayed at 2 other hotels in Chicago ( all within the Hilton chain ) but this was by far our favourite - even better than the W ##aldo ##rf As ##toria in our opinion . You won ' t be disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed this bout ##ique hotel downtown - - friendly , court ##eous staff , excellent , fresh food and a fun bar scene . Hotel room was well out - fitted with soft sheets and towels . I ' ll definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good trip , good service . thank you . As expected everything was fine . This was for the Membership Development Conference , the second biggest gathering of the I ##BE ##W , Your hotel and city were chosen because of the Union affiliation . Thanks again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , better than expectation ! Restaurant ( American Craft ) is excellent for both breakfast and dinner . We wanted to try the other restaurant in the Hotel ( the steak and su ##shi one ) as well , but it was all closed during our stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hospitality from House ##keeping to front desk was over the top . Had a great stay in Chicago due to this hotel , the views were great , the room was clean and the service was over the top . Thank you Intercontinental Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a bachelor ##ette party , and it was well worth the money . Li ##teral ##ly right in the center of everything . We got a millennium suite which was perfect for the night . Only complaint I made was how the wood was chip ##ped and the wall had stuff s ##p ##lattered on it . The other thing was cleaner ##s was knocking at my door at 8 : 30 ##am asking when will I be checking out . Which I thought was rude to just ask that question . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was the most disappointing stay we have ever had at an O ##m ##ni property . You would assume with the location and cost of the rooms the service and attention to detail would be top notch . Well it ' s not even close . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice small hotel , love the out side patio and the staff was great , great Location also . The bartender was awesome and restaurant co ##zy , the bed was co ##zy and the pillows which is a big plus for me ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a long weekend with my husband and 2 teenage ##d children . Room ##y accommodation ##s , walking distance to great restaurants / shopping and easy access to l ! Hotel staff was friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly staff , they helped us in every aspect . Great location and walking distance to so many great things around the city . The room was clean and it even had amazing bath robes in it . I would highly re ##come ##m ##nd this place . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I always or usually come to stay at the Hilton because of the amenities , the comfort of the rooms , and the respect I always receive from all the staff there . Their gym is always clean , and the service is always what I expect ; very good ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay at the Talbot ##t - normally we stay a few blocks south . While the area around this hotel was more quiet and ups ##cale , I think we prefer staying further south to be more central ##ly located to the restaurants and activities we enjoy . The hotel ’ s de ##cor was also very gray and modern , which seemed sort of d ##rea ##ry . However , the lounge / restaurant seemed busy the whole time we were there ( we didn ’ t part ##ake ) and the front desk staff was very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pleasant experience for business right in the heart of Michigan avenue . Some ##w ##hat price ##y . Restaurant was over ##p ##rice ##d but what I expected . What stands out the most was the staff . They were all especially friendly and kind . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had an excellent stay at the Hilton Chicago this weekend , especially because of service I received from Ms Dar ##nell ##a Harper ( in the fitness center ) , Tiffany ( at the front desk ) , and Do ##y Edward Gil ##dar ##t ( at the front desk ) . I will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very convenient location to Michigan avenue shopping and the river . There are several great dining options within the hotel if you prefer not to go out . Some of the rooms have incredible views of the lake and river , be sure to ask . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My experience didn ' t start well because of a slow check - in process and an issue with the UP ##S office being closed on Sunday afternoon ( which meant I couldn ' t get the booth I had to set up ) . However the room was very spacious and comfortable and the rest of the stay went very well ( including good food while on the conference floor ) . I had a couple of meals at the Palm where the staff was excellent and the food was delicious but over ##p ##rice ##d . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a nice bout ##ique hotel , but the rooms are small . I ' m not saying that to mean just a bit smaller than normal . I mean very small . The closet was about 9 inches deep . We had to hang garments at an angle for the door to close . The mirror had hooks on the frame . I suppose these are there because the closet can barely hold anything . This would not be a big deal if the room were bigger . Just be aware . If you intend to have a few nights on the town , you will be hard - pressed to hang your nice clothes . The staff was very nice . The location is good . However , for the price , we will look elsewhere next time we visit Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Pleasant and dig ##ni ##fied stay in the heart of Chicago without a fake smile . Master ##piece ##s of world architecture 10 minutes walk away , as well as top restaurants and shops . I would love to stay in Chicago during spring , summer or autumn . But it was not a priority of business commitments . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent the second half of our business trip taking a couple of days for R and R here . Our room looked out to the river and Trump Hotel . The room was small but the bed was extremely comfortable . Every night at 5 ##p is happy hour . We have stayed at quite a few Kim ##pton Hotels and must say we are spoiled . They served the same wine each night . Would have been nice to see a broader selection of specialty wines like when we stayed in San Diego and Seattle Kim ##pton hotels . We still totally enjoyed it . Great location , can walk the city from here . Great coffee in the lobby every morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chicago was over ##flow ##ing with tourists , and this large , historic hotel was hop ##ping on the Saturday in June when I stayed . The elegant lobby was quite noisy , but the decent sized single room ( with full bed rather than queen ) was very nicely fitted out , and quiet . Location is te ##rri ##fic for live theatre , symphony concert and the art gallery . Check in was a bit slow . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 3 nights in a corner suite on 31st floor . The view is absolutely amazing . Extreme ##ly large window wrap the entire living room and bedroom . Room was very large . Had view of the river , lake and Navy Pier . Sunrise was beautiful over the lake but the d ##rap ##es needed to be closed after as the sun was too much and heated up the room . Staff was very helpful . Could walk across the street and access the stairs to the river walk . Overall stay was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is excellent for central Chicago . Check in was efficient . The room was clean and surprisingly quiet for such a central location . Breakfast was simple but perfectly adequate . Our meeting room on the 6th floor was adequate but there was no men ' s bathroom on the floor . Men had to use the slow elevators to use the rest room . The women ' s rest room had two stalls . I had to wait in the hallway during the meeting at one point . There was one chair in the hallway and the 30 ##ish year old A ##V guy took that chair and left this elderly women to sit on the floor ! I found it weird that he did not get another chair for me or offer me ( the paying customer , about 30 years his senior ) , the one chair . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First class hotel with updated room . Staff friendly and helpful . Con ##ven ##ient to the train from Midway but otherwise the location isn ' t so great . It ' s a hike to most of downtown ' s tourist areas : Michigan Ave , Grant Park , etc . I got a great rate and would stay here again if I got that special deal again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel ! Staff was very re ##ceptive ! Fantastic location . . . easy walking to and from train stations ( both blue and organize lines for either airport ! ) . . . close to shopping & restaurants ! Right in the theatre district if you ’ re looking to catch a show ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed Saturday August 31 . Check in was great . We received 2 drink v ##ou ##chers upon check in . Wen ##t to the bar at 10 ##pm for a drink . We waited at a terrible , e for about 10 minutes as we watched the one waitress working talk to her friend . Finally went up to her to see if we could order a drink . She saw the v ##ou ##chers and said that I can just go up to the bar and she doesn ’ t handle those . Wait ##ed another 10 minutes for the blonde haired bartender to s ##ni ##del ##y ask how he could help after seeing said drink v ##ou ##chers . Pro ##ce ##ed to say he didn ’ t have Mali ##bu , R ##ies ##ling , and Pi ##not in a V ##ER ##Y con ##des ##cend ##ing manner . There are many options in Chicago for a hotel . As H ##ya ##tt member we will NE ##VE ##R stay in this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff and helpful ; clean room and bathroom , I stayed at the 18 floor and had a nice view ( IF you like city view ) ; has a nice gym all what need ; and a great location . Everything you want ! Will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay , it was clean and the staff was great . Only complaint is that the w ##if ##i did not work for us at all . The v ##alet was nice and let me keep my car there past check out which was very convenient ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always a great start when arriving to the hotel when one is greeted by D ##wayne or ch ##ar ##lie . The old Talbot remains my favorite memory of this Hotel location . It has been renovated nicely and the general hotel experience enhanced to a more modern flavor . One still enjoys a very euro ##pe ##an type experience with the modern fl ##air - Even though there are cheaper hotels in the area - overall it ’ s difficult to not be pleased with the reception one experiences with the entire hotel staff - they s ##tri ##ve to please . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad in Chicago had great service from early AM to even late at night . The convenience of text mess ##aging or the app does keep you comfortable on either the coach or in bed . The room was just gorgeous and big for one person . I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants quiet , easy access to shopping , and just want to be spoiled . Thank you again Conrad Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a small s ##na ##g checking in and Ash ##ant ##y stepped up and took care of it . Work ##ed through it and got us where we needed to be - with a smile . The hotel is beautiful and the staff is extremely helpful - and friendly at the same time . Great , comfortable ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved everything ! It felt like home away from home . My room was a king and was very spacious . The room and bathroom was very clean . The staff was very friendly and did their best to accommodate needs . The hotel had plenty of nice sitting areas off of the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel . Location is lovely with a view of the river . Would recommend the " room with a view " option . Court ##eous , friendly , and helpful staff . Good food options . Nice spacious location for conferences . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got a good deal on a hotel cancellation website and this room was wonderful . Short Memorial Weekend trip . this hotel is in the Loop area , not a lot of restaurants nearby , but a short cab ride to Michigan Ave . Beautiful lobby , very nice personnel , comfortable bed , warm shower - what more can I say ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we arrived at the So ##fit ##el , the staff was helpful . There was not one that did not go beyond what was needed . Answer ##ed questions , gave advice , right there when we were arriving , getting out of a cab , etc . Close to the water within walking distance and so beautiful to look at . Just a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As mentioned in other reviews the All ##egro has a great location but the rooms could be small . We got upgraded to a Premier King room which was more than enough space for my boyfriend and I . He ' s 6 ' 4 and had plenty of sq footage to move around . The bathroom is small , but you ' ll survive . Excellent value ! The compliment ##ary coffee / tea bar in the morning is a nice touch , and the happy hour for those who drink . The overall art de ##co design is amazing and really well curated . Special thanks to their romance con ##cier ##ge for arranging our br ##unch reservations and being super helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family including two children age 12 and nine stayed in a one bedroom suite , while my in - laws stayed in a smaller room . The location is excellent - in a quiet street off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The lobby and common areas are very well appointed . The staff was also very helpful , especially the v ##alet and Bell ##man . However the rooms are only so - so . The rooms are all furnished in mon ##oto ##ne be ##ige on white or be ##ige on be ##ige . Although the rooms have all the essential furnishings , some of the these appear to be near ##ing the end of their cycle . In addition our suite came with a single , very small bathroom . I think it measured 5 ' x 6 ' , if that . All in all , this barely 4 out of 5 star hotel was a reasonable option during a busy summer weekend in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was in a very convenient location to the magnificent mile . The size of the room perfectly suited us and our 18 year old son ( 1 bedroom suite ) . The room facilities were excellent although the a / c was a little strong . The bar was good as was the meal we had in the bar . One criticism was that our booking got confused with another lady with the same last name , so I received her accounts and my booking at the hotel then became in her name . The reception ##ist tried to re ##ct ##ify at check in but could not do this fully and told me to contact ACC ##OR Plus . Because of the time difference with Australia they could not be contacted and five days later have yet to respond to my email . I did try to advise the hotel of this by email prior to my arrival but did not receive a response . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Swiss ##ote ##l hotel is located at a prime location . The room was clean , comfortable , and quiet . The reception staff was very friendly and helpful . At the bar Eddie was fantastic . He is a pleasant , court ##eous , and depend ##able . He is extremely professional , and provides service second to none . Hugo was also very professional and friendly . I had a great experience on this stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel itself was nice , but for what you pay you expect slightly more . Po ##sitive ##s : 1 ) Great location 2 ) Good dining options 3 ) Beautiful lobby The Me ##h 1 . $ 67 for v ##alet and $ 55 for regular parking ! 2 . The maid barely cleaned the room while we there and before we arrived . We had half empty bottles of s ##ham ##po ##o in the room upon arrival and so many dust b ##un ##nies under the bed . 3 . Nothing terribly unique about this property It ’ s worth staying at if you don ’ t have a car and you can get an ok rate . But otherwise me ##h . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are frequent guests , and there is , quite simply , no better hotel for the money , overall , in Chicago , or , perhaps , anywhere . Excellent location , suite - style rooms , great kitchen , ho ##sp ##ita ##ble bar . But the best part of the hotel is the consistent and genuinely friendly , competent service from E ##VE ##R ##Y ##ON ##E on staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is in an ideal location right off the Ma ##g Mile . We stayed 3 nights and were very pleased with the kindness and efficiency of the staff , the clean ##liness of the hotel and room , and the location . The communication via phone app is great and the response immediate . Room service was pro ##mpt and the food very ta ##sty . I had lunch with a friend at the restaurant and the food , service and view were very good . The lobby was decorated with Christmas de ##cor and smelled heavenly of pine . I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and my friends were delighted with my choice for our weekend together . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a FA ##B ##U ##L ##O ##US hotel . Don ' t book anywhere else . Perfect location and perfect hotel . The door ##man D ##wayne is so ##oo ##oo special that you want to take him home with you . He does everything for you from taking your bags to putting a big smile on your face . The con ##cier ##ge , R ##oan ##e is so good that she finds you the best of the best restaurants in the city . A lovely ups ##cale hotel in the middle of the Gold Coast of Chicago [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a great hotel , location , staff , room and amenities . We enjoyed our stay at this hotel , the staff where very friendly and assisted us with all our questions with welcoming smiles on their faces . The location is perfect when visiting Chicago it was close and convenient to restaurants , local sights ##ee ##ing locations could be easily accessed by walking and the hotel itself is an iconic architectural building in Chicago . Anyone visiting Chicago for the first time I would recommend checking in here you will not be disappointed , oh and enjoy a meal at Mi ##che ##al Jordan ’ s St ##eak ##house just delicious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got a room upgrade on the 29th floor with a river view . Can ' t stop looking at my window with the Chicago river . Sunrise at 5 ##am was picture perfect . Room was spacious and hotel has a direct access to the river walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] With a striking ##ly modern building located close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile in midst of a nice neighborhood , this hotel should have all it takes for a top rating . And indeed the rooms and bathroom leave little to be desired , both aesthetic ##ally and functional ##ly . However , service is erratic , to say the least . Next to Vernon , the competent , persona ##ble con ##cier ##ge , I encountered both a female assistant manager as well as a door ##man who definitely do not do the hotel proud . And no a ##pologies forthcoming ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were delighted at size of rooms and the perfect location . The staff were very at ##ten ##tive and overall a great choice - moments from great shops , bars and restaurants and ideal ##ly located to visit all the wonder ##fi ##l sights Cho ##ca ##go has to offer . ! F ##abulous value for a major City . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I traveled from Urban Michigan to Chicago for a large conference . The inner City is not a good place to drive , because there is no place to park , so I was using taxi cab ##s or U ##ber . Staff at the hotel were very friendly , and helpful in securing rides . Room were clean , and the services were great . Price ##s were high , so make sure that you have considerable cash . This is clearly a high class Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very close to millennium park . Room size is very good and so is overall service . This has been my best experience in Chicago so far . It ' s quite well located and convenient when you want to explore downtown but want to be little away from crowded places [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our dinner , held in the El ##eve River ##view room on the 42nd floor was f ##abulous . Aside from the spectacular views , the service was outstanding . Veronica Navarro and Maria Gross ##i made sure every detail from room reservations to the menu selected was perfect . They were re ##sp ##ons ##ive to my every request . I knew I was in good hands when I had no worries over the approaching event for our firm . The professional ##ism and thoughtful ##ness displayed by Ashley Cass ##ic our banquet manager on site that evening as well as Marie and Florence our banquet staff , went above and beyond expectations . I highly recommend the first class accommodation ##s and service the Swiss ##ote ##l provides . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was very nice , and located in a great area . The hotel staff were all pleasant and helpful . I was impressed with the quick ##ness by which the house ##keeping staff cleaned my room — Saturday morning I left for about an hour , and it had already been serviced when I got back . I ’ ll definitely be staying here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town for business and stayed at Palmer House for convenience . It ’ s been years since I ’ ve stayed at the hotel , usually op ##ting for smaller , bout ##ique hotels when in Chicago . The lobby was as spectacular and vibrant as I remember , especially decorated so f ##estive ##ly for the holidays . The room itself was a basic , no f ##rill ##s room . I had a “ hip and historic king ” room . Bar ##ely enough room to maneuver around the king sized bed . A simple bathroom . The room was clean and comfortable although I was surprised that I could hear the el trains below , even being on the 21st floor . I ’ d give it a 5 for the lobby and location ; a 3 for the very basic room , thus the 4 overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a nice hotel , and worked great for a kids s ##lumber party . I did not like having a neighboring connecting room , cause you can hear everything . A guest also complained at 9 ##pm about kids laughing while playing a game . . really ? ? ( S ##ni ##tches get s ##ti ##tches ! ) The staff new it was a s ##lumber party , I wish they would have given us a more isolated room . There were hardly any people there too . Otherwise it is a family friendly place and the pool is nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##xi ##mity to shopping and attraction was a plus for us since we have an active 5 year old . Fun walking down Michigan Ave . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will be staying here again . Staff was readily available to assist with our needs ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every single team member I encountered was friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and professional . The food was te ##rri ##fic and the amenities and view are first class . I was always greeted , felt welcomed and appreciated for my business . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was treated great , the person that checked me in was great , warm and polite . Very charming and persona ##ble . Great room and good location to downtown . I was able to get a free room upgrade as well due to Lo ##lla ##pal ##oo ##za in town , which was fine by me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights after trying to find a hotel that was not too corporate . This place for the bill . Although the rooms are not charming they are done for a few nights , the staff is g ##enia ##l , the location is just right , and the lobby restaurant serves decent food with a hip atmosphere . The hotel offers guests a free glass of daily wine and sometimes a ch ##it for $ 10 to be used in the restaurant . I would go back . It ’ s quiet and has a lot of good restaurants in walking distance . It ’ s about a mile and a half from the Art Institute . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at Home ##wood Suite ##s for 10 years and we have had a wonderful experience each time . The Suite ##s are comfortable and the staff are extremely g ##rac ##ious and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting l . The Breakfast B ##uff ##et is outstanding and the manager ' s reception is more than you expect . The location is ideal for shopping , theaters and sporting events . Free trolley rides to Navy Pier ! G ##ua ##rant ##eed pleasant stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service was nice and rooms are clean . It was nice stay . Vale ##t parking was a little expensive and actually more than the W ##aldo ##rf As ##toria and Lang ##ham . I ’ m sure we ’ ll stay there again in the future if needed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location , the service is great , the rooms are g ##eor ##ge ##ous , i didn ##t had the better view , but even so , it was ok , the foot at the restaurant was Del ##icious , and the staff is nice and kind [SEP]
0	[CLS] I couldn ’ t be more delighted than with the service we received upon our first stay at this property . The staff were friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The hotel was clean and well pre ##pped for the unique needs of a travel ##er during this pan ##de ##mic . Hotel breakfast was delicious and I wished I would have tried it out first day there , as then I would have ordered it every day . Make sure to have a staff member show you you all of the lights and motor ##ized shade function in the suites as they can be trick ##y and can seem like they are ma ##lf ##un ##ction ##ing . You just need a quick tutor ##ial and you ’ ll be all set . I look forward to future visits to this property . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is a throw back to another age . The Grand Ball ##room is amazing , and you can imagine mob ##sters , politicians , and industrialist all dancing and shaping history together . The staff was awesome , so helpful . Great customer service . Kitty O ' Shea ##s has good food and spirits . I enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was exceptional , rooms were large and staff was very friendly and helpful . Less than a block from Michigan Ave and the Chicago River . Would recommend to family and friends and will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was nice and rooms were more than adequate . Could use a little update . Quite a lot of restaurants in the area . Heat ##ing device can be a little noisy in some rooms . Good breakfast . Standard hotel , you get what you pay for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We used this hotel for my daughter ' s wedding . It was awesome ! ! ! We had a lot of out of town guests and everything went beautifully . Great customer service . Love ##d the prose ##cco and coffee bar . Thank you Hotel All ##egro . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very enjoyable place to stay and has convenient access to Michigan Avenue and also public transport ##ai ##on . It was very cold so we only used U ##ber for transportation this time . Staff is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly which helped make our stay very enjoy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love Kim ##pton properties and this one did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Our room had a river view and was decorated very modern and contemporary . The room has a window box that I just spent time sitting in reading and even took a nap after a long day of running around the city . The staff and the service is exceptional and everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel . The only odd thing was our w ##if ##i wouldn ' t work - called the front desk and they tried to help so I suspect it may have been my location in the hotel . It ' s a short walk to all the key sites in town and it will be the only place I stay when I go to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an amazing experience staying here for a week . Staff was friendly and helpful , every request was met . Service is excellent . This hotel is in a perfect location . Nice shops and restaurants are within walking location . Would very much so stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great weekend stay at P ##U ##BL ##IC . The staff was incredibly helpful . My flight got in at 7 ##am . I called them to let them know and by the time I arrived my room was ready . Love the style of this place . Two great bars , one with a co ##zy fireplace . The location is nice since its still in the main part of the city , but in a quiet ##er ups ##cale residential section ( Like Upper West Side NYC ) . Can ' t say enough about the staff , bartender ##s , bell ##men , and managers I met ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] One of my worst stay in Chicago ! ! The staff are not only ignorant but also quite rude . On our second day , we came back to the room around 4 pm on Sunday . The room was not cleaned . I had to come down to the con ##cier ##ge to get some new towels . The staff simply said , " you go back to your room and call the house cleaning ! ! " No apology from anybody . When some one finally came up to the room with the requested towels , he constantly talked back and said , " the room can be cleaned any time of the day ! ! " . I do hope that they won ' t come back in the midnight to clean it ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent hotel and staff . Very re ##sp ##ons ##ive to a phone call regarding the air condition ##er on a sat ##ur ##day night . Maintenance was in the room within 10 minutes of our phone call . wonderful old 1920 ' s pool . Location is great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was beautifully appointed and for the cost was definitely worth it . It had all the amenities of a luxury hotel , including a fantastic bath ##tub and excellent views . A few things , however , were missing such as outlets next to the bed for ease of phone charging . Odd . Otherwise , it was a great stay and I would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My nonprofit organization has successfully held our annual black tie gal ##a benefit at the Fair ##mont Chicago since 2010 and each year it just gets better and better . The Imperial Ball ##room is beautiful , the food is delicious , service is great , and the catering manager has always been an expert plan ##ner and a pleasure to work with . Our guests say it ' s their favorite event of the gal ##a season . Special shout outs to catering staff Al ##yssa on working so hard for her first time with us and getting it right , and to banquet managers Naomi and Win ##fried for being there at all the right times and for leading their staff in providing excellent service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great shower . Room small . Bed ##s need new mattress ##es as the existing ones just roll you off the side . Outstanding staff , particularly the door ##man . If you drive , sign up for one of the discount parking a ##ps . You ' ll use the same underground parking lot and less than half the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have booked this hotel for my Birthday in June 202 ##1 hoping to have a great stay given the price , but unfortunately this hotel did not meet expectations at all . There was only one small s ##ham ##po ##o for both of us , the room itself was very old , the stuff looked like they hate their jobs . I would NO ##T recommend this hotel in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel on third party site and took a chance . . . . Great experience . . . At ##ten ##tive staff from the minute I drove up to when I checked out . . . Um ##bre ##llas were a great hotel service as it rain ##ed that day . . . . Just top notch hotel . . . . . Bed was so comfortable . . . they pay attention to detail . . . Good location to so many wonderful places for shopping , eating and tourists . . . Give it a try and enjoy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in a well - appointed , small hotel room . It was peacefully quiet and included a beautiful tile ##d bathroom with 2 shower options ( wa ##nd and rain shower ) . We didn ' t eat at hotel but breakfast menu and bar looked inviting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] As a solo travel ##er this hotel is located at mid ##point of every tourist ##ic activity . The staff are very professional and the food and drinks are pretty good ! The rooms are spacious , clean and co ##zy . What more can you ask for ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was great , but a couple of comments . Not a whole lot of space for bathroom items . W ##O ##uld be great if there was a shelf under the sink for items . One day my coffee station was not re ##fill ##ed for some reason . : ( [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed during a business trip to Chicago . Nice central location . Clean rooms . Friendly and helpful staff . Breakfast in the restaurant was very good and reasonably priced . Would stay at the H ##ya ##tt Regency on my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was in for a wedding , had two rooms for two nights . Our room was over the bar , thought we were at a concert in the room it was so loud . I get a bill a month after my stay for a third room that I never booked . They must have had my card on file and used it without my authorization a month later for a room that I didn ' t have a reservation for . Instead of apology for the error , Garrett at the Hotel tells me they forgot to s ##wi ##pe my card for the room . Hotel is in a good location other than that wouldn ' t recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] PR ##Os - - central ##ly located - beautiful building CO ##N ##s - - over ##p ##rice ##d as usual - slow and un ##friend ##ly service from check in desk to Lock ##wood breakfast check ##in - no smiles , no appreciation for being a loyal H ##ON ##OR ##S member for over 30 years , - need a ##co ##uti ##c panels in the foyer - WA ##Y TO ##O L ##O ##U ##D with echo and not good for meetings [SEP]
1	[CLS] run down place with over ##p ##rice ##d restaurants and bar . nothing really special . two towers make it just too big of a property to be properly taken care of . that ' s just the reality . there are better places around the town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 5 nights . . . room was a really good size and loved the free W ##i ##F ##i . Close to Michigan Ave . breakfast ##s were good . Staff really friendly and polite . I would definitely recommend this hotel . Love ##d the Mac n cheese on room service . Home cooked , [SEP]

The staff was very friendly and the beds are super comfortable . I would definitely stay here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 1 night . Check in was easy , lobby is nice , friendly staff ( although the front desk staff did not tell me where the elevator was located so I could go to my room ) , great location , bed was very com ##fy . Had a city view room with a view of downtown Chicago , the beach , and Navy Pier . Would recommend this hotel and would stay here again . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Thanks to Diana at the reception , we got a great room with a view . We stayed for two nights in 131 ##3 and the whole view outside was outstanding , day and night . Everything in the room was clean and brand - new . We will come back again next time . This is also best location to near - by attractions . AMC movie theater with very relaxing re ##c ##lining seats as well as visit to M ##M is just a 5 min walk . The breakfast spread was more than enough . We enjoyed our stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This past weekend was the 2nd time that we have stayed here when visiting Chicago . They upgraded us to a better room with a great view this last time for free . Everyone that works here is very nice and they go out of there way to make you feel important to them . They are all pretty fun and seem to love their jobs ! The maintenance guy even ask me if I needed help when I was looking for the ice machine . The beds are really comfortable and the rooms are very clean . Location is great . You can easily walk to a lot of the tourist spots or U ##ber it . The only thing is we were a little disappointed they took the refrigerator out of the rooms , guess it has something to do with Co ##vid . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel . Mini bar , fridge , k ##eur ##ig , com ##fy bed , really nice shower . Room isn ' t huge but still nice . Bell man helpful & stored our bags . A ##ble to check in early . Pro ##mot service when called for more towels . Location is good . Easy access to attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great experience at this location - this is my favorite H ##ya ##tt Regency location and favorite hotel in Chicago - great gym ; request for defeat ##hering was handled promptly and both house ##keeping and front desk was very kind . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a fan of Kim ##pton hotels so was happy to give the Monaco in Chicago a try on a quick visit . I was not disappointed . The hotel itself is in a f ##abulous location , within walking distance to shopping , restaurants , just about all Chicago has to offer . The staff was so friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The room was a large corner suite on the 7th floor with magnificent views of the city and river . The windows were huge and each had an up ##hol ##stered window seat with comfortable pillows for enjoying the view or just relaxing with a book . It was a room that was difficult to leave ! I can ' t say enough nice things about this hotel from the location to the great people working there ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am always pleased with the time I spend at this Property . Great location and clean . I will return often ! I am always treated well ! It is a very well kept updated property , It is an easy walk to shopping and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad in Chicago was the best hotel I have ever stayed at for business . Very nice rooms and great conference facilities . It was also convenient to Michigan Avenue . Staff was very helpful and friendly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was clean and quiet . The hospitality hour , dinner and breakfast were all great . The service was top notch . I could not ask for a better experience . Check ##out was easy . The overall experience was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ki ##nz ##ie on a one night business trip . F ##abulous experience from check in through continental breakfast ( served on your floor ) , through check out . Room ##s are very large . Just a block from river walk , and loads of restaurants ( don ' t miss Me ##rca ##dit ##o ) . Very , very good service . I will be back for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family stayed here last month for a few days . This hotel was very convenient ##ly located to nearby restaurants , shopping , and tourist sites . For the location it was an excellent value for us compared to other downtown hotels . We were able to get a suite for the same price as other hotels were charging for a room . The suite was on the 16th floor and was relatively quiet . We had no trouble sleeping at night . It also offers a good free breakfast in the morning . All in all I would definitely consider staying here again if we go back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Living here for a conference meeting . The Room is extremely l ##ux ##ious with two bathroom ##s . The f ##ac ##ilt ##y is very nice . If price is NO ##T a problem , this would be an A ##wes ##ome option for a business stay . The surrounding environment is attractive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago and it was simply wonderful ! From the g ##rac ##ious & friendly check in to the efficient and speed ##y check out , our stay was memorable . The hotel de ##cor is modern and very appealing . Our room was spacious , comfortable and so quiet . The location was great as Michigan Avenue was close . This is a place we wish to return to and is highly recommended . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed here for a small conference hosted by the University of Chicago ' s business school ; this was incredibly convenient because it was just around the corner . It ' s also nice that the school has a relationship with the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal , because the direct bill ##ing and reservations were sea ##m ##less . However , this would also be a convenient location for any of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shops and restaurants ; we walked to a restaurant around 15 minutes away and it was an easy trip . Very professional and polite staff , too ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed here with a few friends for a weekend get ##away . Hotel has a modern feel but not in your face and stays true to the history of the building . Room was clean and quiet and everything that you could ask for and more for the price level . My one complaint ( as with all Chicago hotels ) is the parking fee . I ' ll be clear they are in line with every other hotel in the area but personally I would rather pay more for the room to not feel like I ' m getting go ##uge ##d on parking . Just my two cents . Other than that , the service was great and I would be more than willing to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I really enjoyed our time at the Swiss ##ote ##l and felt like a king and queen from the moment we arrived . The staff spoiled us and made us feel so special , taking the time to familiar ##ize us with the hotel and ensure we had everything we needed . Extra special shout out to Victoria at the reception desk who was engaging , smart and an absolute delight to work with . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The conference I attended was at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker and so I stayed at the hotel . The meeting space was very nice and the food was good but the room was small . It had a king - size bed which took up too much space . It would have worked so much better if they put a queen - size bed in the room , particularly when the guest is a single person . The shower is also somewhat small and has a rain - shower head and a hand - held shower but the hand - held goes straight out ( hitting me in the face ) and the rain - shower was more like a mist , hard to get r ##ins ##ed off with that ! ! Staff members were all very nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting though it took several calls to get the remote for the TV fixed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I recently spent five days at the Fair ##mont in Chicago . We have traveled all over the world and stayed in many fine hotels . However , this hotel ranks among the very best . The service was outstanding . Each person we encountered was court ##eous , helpful and friendly . We will definitely return to this hotel anytime we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a wonderful old hotel that has been nicely updated . It is located right off Michigan avenue and Water ##tower place . My only concern is their high priced parking but they are pretty much in line with other hotels in the area - - so the answer is to leave your car at home ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at the So ##fit ##el for our anniversary . Upon check in we were warmly greeted by the staff . We found our room and got settled in . Sad ##ly we found under ##gar ##ments in the closet that did not belong to us and we had to have them removed before we could settle in completely . The room was nice we had 2 beds and an adequate view . The cable was out more than we could count on the rainy days we were there which made it challenging . Thank ##ful one of us had a book to entertain us . We enjoyed the close ##ness of the hotel and spent what time we could away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is nice and staff are friendly . The rooms are just b ##land and need more fl ##air / design to make the stay more warm . The overall stay in the room was s ##ter ##ile and lacking the 20 / 30 ##s charm I thought it would have . The hotel overall is great , welcoming staff and great facilities downstairs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ent hotel but pretty b ##lah lobby and rooms . Nothing to r ##ave about but if you ' re looking for convenience to sites or an economical base of operations it would be ok . Staff was friendly but I just didn ' t see anything that set this hotel apart . Lots of cool hotels in Chicago - this one disappointed [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wedding ring was stolen in the morning of my check ##out . Had it on dress ##or , went for breakfast and came back to find it was gone . Security tell me the cleaning staff went into room when I was gone but they didn ##t do anything . Ho ##rrible experience no compensation so far and i actually had to call them during my second day to service my room ( never done ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful and has so many p ##rist ##ine features to it that it makes it nice to look at just for show . The staff is court ##eous and pro ##mpt . Outside staff will call a cab for you and help you load your luggage . Great location for tourism . Food access is great in and out of hotel ( bar Louie is worth going to ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] Ke ##enan - you the man ! This is the guy that will get things done around the hotel . He is super friendly , professional , and will go out of his way to make sure all needs are met . It really contributed to my Chicago experience and I would love to return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful historic but very updated hotel . Had a nice large , double room . Great location - south loop , 5 blocks from Art Museum , close to lots of great restaurants . They pay attention to details . Fe ##lt very p ##amp ##ered [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our Junior Suite with its two bathroom ##s - such a treat when getting ready to go out ! The hotel ’ s Michigan Avenue is in the perfect location for shopping and for hail ##ing a cab , or U ##ber and just a short ride to our favorite restaurants ! Everyone on the hotel staff was happy , very friendly , professional and truly determined to please - THE ##Y W ##ER ##E FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I always feel so welcome and comfortable every single time I stay here . the rooms are so luxurious and com ##fy . the restaurant is awesome and lots I can eat considering I am c ##eli ##ac that is such a huge bonus . the staff are warm and the servers in the restaurant especially at ##ten ##tive . I won ' t stay anywhere else in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location coupled with quality room and amenities . Help ##ful and court ##eous front desk staff and knowledge ##able con ##cier ##ge . Minor issues in room at check - in were addressed and corrected quickly . Excellent choice for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was amazing ! Service was great , room was comfortable , and they offered every am ##eni ##ty im ##agi ##na ##ble . They even had robes and ear plug ##s in the room . We walked all over , to the waterfront , the bean , North ##erly Island and tons of restaurants were in the area . I ’ m in love with the wall ##paper in our room ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed one night at Swiss ##ô ##tel Chicago super last minute due to unexpected travel changes . Check in / check out process was quick and pain ##less . Night time check in agent provided great customer service with a smile . Room was clean and spacious . Bath ##room had a tub and stall shower , though shower was on the small side and water became s ##cor ##ching hot mid shower . Hopefully the hotel can address this . Bed was comfortable and provided a good nights sleep . Rate was on the price ##y side but I suppose it ’ s expected for a Swiss ##ô ##tel property . All in all a solid stay , would definitely return again if opportunity arose . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were nice but the service was average at best . Nothing was provided as indicated with the O ##m ##ni Select Guest status . There are several great options in Chicago so we will probably try a different hotel our next trip . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed for one night and I was amazed , the staff was very friendly , helpful and go beyond to making sure you are served . My room was clean , comfortable bed , large space . The food was awesome , great atmosphere as well . The manager B ##re , the best I felt so welcomed and appreciated . I will definitely stay again , [UNK] thank you Ambassador Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Original room assigned was not a good one , overlooking rooftop ##s and old un ##att ##rac ##tive buildings . Jose took us to the room and understood our issue . He called downstairs and moved us to a three sided view of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Jordan ’ s was a wonderful lunch and the in hotel Star ##bu ##cks was a nice light breakfast . Tax ##is were p ##lent ##iful and in general a nice holiday . The ongoing sire ##ns were a bit disturbing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The good : The hotel is newly renovated , supreme ##ly pet - friendly , and a 10 - minute walk from Millennium Park - - and I love the bath products ! ( The soap , in particular , is to die for . ) The bad : Flat sheets on the bed . I des ##pis ##e the things , because they never stay tucked in properly . What ' s wrong with fitted sheets ? Also , our the ##rm ##ost ##at didn ' t work properly ( to keep the room a comfortable temperature , we had to set the the ##rm ##ost ##at at 82 ##F ! ) . The ugly : Your view will include Trump Tower . No , that ' s not the hotel ' s fault , but it ' s an unfortunate thing . Overall , my better half and I had a great stay , and we look forward to returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] U ##gh . This hotel is in sad shape . Co ##sm ##etic ##ally , it is in need of new floor ##ing , new wall ##paper , and fresh coat of paint on the m ##op boards and trim . And good grief , hire a window wash ##er ! The staff was very helpful and friendly and the location was fantastic , but I would stay elsewhere . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My business trip to Chicago was made more relaxing with the professional courtesy of the Hilton staff , the comfort and clean ##liness of the room and the ease of access from the hotel to the rest of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was beautiful . We had no problems . the location is great . I can ##t wait to stay again . Park ##ing is kind of a drag b ##c there ' s only v ##alet . But its to be expected in ch ##ica ##go . Take cab ##s if you can . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very welcome at the Gold Room . Sharon , Jesus and everyone were very nice ##H ##ote ##l is convenient ##ly located at Chicago , near the river , restaurants and stores . Walking distance to everywhere . Nice attention by everyone ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel that clearly takes CO ##VI ##D seriously . I was a little disappointed by how much they nickel and dim ##e you . You ' re paying a lot for a room and if you ' re celebrating a special occasion you need to pay even extra for a treat that other hotels give you for free ( e . g . , chocolate ##s ) . The the ##rm ##ost ##at in our room was very fin ##ick ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the very cool top floor lobby and bar to one of the most comfortable rooms we ’ ve ever had , this was 5 star . The bed was great and TV excellent . The location can ’ t be much better . The rooftop bar wasn ’ t open yet . . . . . but yet another reason to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location . Gorge ##ous historic architecture . At 3 : 00 pm on a Thursday afternoon , check - in line was 25 people deep . Ashley at check ##in / reception was really nice and made me almost forget how long I had stood in line . The rooms and bathroom ##s could use some up ##dating . And being an old hotel , hallway and room to room noise is pretty sign ##fica ##nt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Re ##quest the newer wing . Room ##s were large and the bathroom was l ##us ##cious . Had numerous cater ##ed events and the food far exceeded my expectations of conference food . Architecture was rich with history too . Take some time and walk around the 2nd and 3rd floors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel . Jack was very welcoming at check in . My city view room was beautiful also looking right over the water . Located right in the heart of downtown Chicago . I had the best night sleep as well . I recommend Wild berries for breakfast quick walk over there . I got the be ##rry c ##re ##pes , and Mexican has ##h very s ##pic ##y ! Also try making reservations at C ##ite . Very top floor the sunset views are amazing after that hit the navy pier . Such a good stay in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a very nice hotel in the heart of downtown ch ##ica ##go . Within walking distance of the magnificent mile , the navy pier and the el trains . Little p ##ric ##y if you eat in the hotel , but lots of great places to eat and shop near the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our visit to the Ki ##nz ##ie was fantastic ! Josh in the double cross was so awesome ! ! Ce ##le ##bra ##ting our friend ’ s birthday and he was so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! Will definitely be back ! ! We went to the reception and j ##osh was so fun ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t hotel and staff did a excellent job of ass ##uring our family had no worries and eliminated concerns during our stay . D ##wayne assured we had all our needs attended to and the rest of the hotel staff were also very helpful in assisting with our requests . I would plan on return visits to Chicago we would include the Talbot ##t Hotel as the base for our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed just under a week and was very satisfied with the quality of service , clean ##liness and services offered . It was so close to many attractions and easy for me to run out for a walk on the water ##walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The last Conrad we stayed at was in Seoul . The Conrad Seoul was an all - around 5 star experience , from super at ##ten ##tive and personal ##ized service , to p ##rist ##ine rooms . This Conrad was designed and built to those standards , however the service at this particular location in Chicago was lacking , I would ' ve expected the level of service from a 2 . 5 - 3 star hotel . The house ##keeping is ok . However , they miss the mark on paying attention to detail and cleaning thoroughly . The location is great , convenient ##ly located one block off of Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent 5 days at this Hotel in Chicago . Location is perfect , rooms are very spacious and the kitchen is really a good feature for a family stay . But Internet was extremely poor , and even not working in the evenings . I had to give up working on my La ##pt ##op since receiving and sending e - mail ##s was not working at all . The reception gave me a boost ##er , but this was of no help . But the worse part was that House ##keeping didn ' t show up for 2 days in a row . . . no room cleaning , now clean towels . . . I have called them everyday , but nobody showed up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pa ##id on Can ##cel ##on , then asked to pay another $ 15 per night on top of that fee . Room is dated and small , not really all that great . Book ##ed due to online pictures but I saw nothing that spectacular about the hotel nor the " facilities " I didn ' t use or find any that were of use . Location is nice but you can get that anywhere . Really not worth the price . Park ##ing is also high if you needed it , we used a parking garage elsewhere . Room quality about the same as a Mo ##tel 6 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Disc ##lai ##mer , I stay here a least once a year . I also review it each year because I like this property overall and want to be sure travelers have the reviews they need . It ' s getting the time that the She ##rato ##n does a few upgrades . My mattress was fine , but it ' s time to replace it . A water pipe was replaced and it would have been helpful to know that was going to happen as I planned to work in my room during the repair . That ' s it for the issues , everything else , especially the staff was great . I ' ll plan on staying next year , and you cannot beat the view and the location without paying twice as much , and who wants to do that ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The ambassador a . K . A . The P ##U ##BL ##IC is the perfect bout ##ique hotel . Great location in a beautiful walk ##able neighborhood with the best accommodation ##s . Room ##s very nicely appointed and the wonderful coffee breakfast bar on the guest floor . Dog friendly . People friendly . And truly beautifully styled . Under ##state ##d with everything you need . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location on magnificent mile . Staff very friendly . Room rate a bit high , but likely comparable to other similar properties . Ann ##oya ##nce - - Having to take two elevators to get to room . Internet service slow and even guests with status have to pay for faster services . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was in a great location in Chicago . Close to everything . The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly and very helpful . I would definitely return and recommend to my friends . So glad I chose this hotel for our mini vacation with friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice upgrades since last I visited and the Breakfast / Dinner were ta ##sty , rooms were super clean . Con ##vie ##nant to Down Town Events also many options for dining out very close by . Staff also excellent overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Jose helped us with our check in , he and all the staff were awesome , always available to help , they explained about the use of face masks , and the re ##cu ##rrence of the cleaning service due to the co ##vid , the location is great , the neighborhood is fantastic , you feel save , tons of shops and restaurants walking distance [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in the historic tower with 2 beds . The room was a good size and was very clean . Hotel location was great . Every single staff person we encountered was amazing , and very helpful . Bed ##s and pillows were very comfortable . I stayed at this hotel when i was a kid about 20 years ago and couldn ' t wait to show my husband and kids the pool . . . we went to the floor the pool was on and when I seen it I burst out laughing . . . . it was under construction L ##OL ! It worked out fine th ##o because we were so busy there was no time to swim ! I wish parking was a little cheaper ( its $ 71 ) a day , but understand ##able since its the city . Will definitely return on our next Chicago trip down the road . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is not only central ##ly located , but it is " spot on " . If you bring younger children , they will love the window seat as their own private con ##do . food is close by and " the kitchen " restaurant is one of the best ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This modern , sleek hotel is located just off Michigan Avenue in an area with great restaurants and shops . The welcome was very warm , with excellent , professional staff who wanted to ensure that we would enjoy our stay . The benefits of the AM ##EX program were clearly explained and we received an upgrade . The room was spacious with beautiful views of the neighborhood and the bathroom was well laid out , with a separate tub and shower ( and nice La ##n ##vin products ) . The bar has a great atmosphere and excellent staff serving fine cocktail ##s and small dishes . Finally , breakfast is served in the air ##y and bright restaurant and the c ##rois ##san ##ts in particular are not to be missed . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] During ##no ##ut long weekend in Chicago I decided to try this hotel . We usually stay at the Ivy , so this would be a much different experience . Glad we did . First class all around . Purple Pig right across the street . Easy walk to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Wow ! Be sure to check out the amazing swimming pool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visited here because my niece was having her wedding reception here and both my son and his family and grandson and his family stayed here . Because both requested a king size bed the room was very very small and they both had a to ##ddler with them . It was a very old hotel and looked it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel welcome ##s you with an op ##ulent lobby and welcoming staff . The business class room was great , and elevator service was fast . The cleaning crew cleaned the room efficiently during our stay . The location of the hotel to many routes of the L within a few blocks was a great advantage . [SEP]
0	[CLS] After seeing photos and learning the history of this hotel , I made a plan to check it out while visiting Chicago . I had breakfast here in their Lock ##wood Restaurant . The hostess and waits ##ta ##ff were incredibly friendly , funny and down - to - earth . The food was good , p ##lent ##iful and reasonable . The lobby is breath ##taking . I returned for happy hour to find the bar was full and lively . It was a great place to hang ##out and have a cocktail . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They b ##ot ##ched my reservations , over ##charged me on rates they told me they price matched to the reservation they b ##ot ##ched , Court ##es ##y desk was anything but helpful ( After explaining my issue they ghost ##ed me and went on to assist the next customer ) , and they failed L ##IT ##ER ##AL ##L ##Y E ##VE ##R ##Y E ##X ##P ##EC ##TA ##TI ##ON ! And I don ' t expect much so that screams volume . It ' s safe to say I will NE ##VE ##R be staying at AN ##Y ##TH ##ING even remotely affiliated with Kim ##pton because of Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro . Thanks for the royal A * * f ##u * * * * * [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very slow check - in . Staff bypass ##ed the credit card pin so naturally my card declined the transaction , so I then hear ‘ Your card has not gone through ’ as if it was my fault . I had to ask her why and push for a 2nd attempt , telling her I needed to key in a pin . Room is smaller than NYC rooms ( 4th floor ) but priced similarly . The walls are paper thin - I can hear the couple next door having a conversation . Fantastic location with lots of transportation options and within walking distance to many of the city ’ s attractions plus plenty of shops and restaurants in the area . A 2 - min walk to the Museum of Contemporary Art . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was on the 32 floor with a nice view . It was very comfortable and quiet . Check in was very efficient and the hotel offers a variety of dining / snack options . Very clean as well . The staff is wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall very nice location and friendly staff . The only problem was noise that was on and off and we could not figure out were it was coming from . Had maintain ##ance come up to check it out but at that time it was quiet . In the end we were convinced it was from nearby service elevator that was in use mostly during daytime but o ##cca ##tional ##ly during night time and early morning hours . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is perfectly located in the real downtown , just few steps from shopping mall ##s and rest ##ua ##rants . I had a room with great river view that was really beautiful , especially at night . The room was clean , big enough . Service of the staff was perfect . The only negative remarks is the breakfast room , it was really too busy in the morning and the capacity of seat cannot handle the number of guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location of this place is great and the area it is in has many restaurant options . Room ##s are average and clean . Bar is nice but small and they allow reservations so it makes finding a place to sit difficult . El ##eva ##tors only worked half the visit and are small . This was problematic being that we were on the 8th floor of 16 . They have a coffee bar but get there early as they didn ' t rest ##ock consistently and it was often empty . Work ##out room is very nice and has great options . Overall , this place has the potential to be a great bout ##ique hotel but it was only good based on the above . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our first time back to The Talbot ##t in several years and everything was perfect ! The Talbot ##t is close to everything we love in the Gold Coast - shopping , restaurants , museums , etc . During our stay we had meals and drinks at the Talbot ##t more than usual - the food and service were wonderful ! The entire staff was te ##rri ##fic but two folks who were especially wonderful were Dee the bartender and Rosemary M in house ##keeping . They were like family - friendly , welcoming and professional . High ##ly Re ##com ##men ##ded ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to this hotel as a group of 12 . The Con ##cier ##ge David was AM ##A ##Z ##ING , he took great care of us , he suggested good restaurants in the area and then took care of making our reservations . Each day he sent up snack ##s for our " group room " He said hello to us each time one of us went past the front desk . We are very impressed . Also Michelle at the front desk made sure we had everything we needed and was super friendly . We never felt out of place in this fancy place . If we get back to Chicago we will for sure go back ! The king room we had was a ta ##d small but other rooms were nice , we really only slept there so it did not make a big difference to us . The fitness center was great ! Love ##d the T ##read ##mill with the TV attached . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve been travelling to Chicago a great deal lately and have found my home away from home on the Fair ##mont Gold Floor . The rooms are beautiful , views te ##rri ##fic and having the lounge available for la ##ttes , breakfast , snack ##s and beverages just down the hall makes the stay so easy . On top of all that the lounge staff make you feel welcome and cared for . All staff are great but there is one in particular , Man ##dan ##a , that takes such good care of me in the mornings I feel great all day . . . no matter how crazy my day becomes ! I look forward to my next trip here and while the rest of the hotel is lovely as well I ' ll be staying on the Gold Floor ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] perfect location great staff good food nice and clean room not expensive compare to the highest services perfect view nice and quite close to down town with many restaurants near by the hotel , shops and many other place to v ##ist [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel is wonderful , and right next to one of the largest Star ##bu ##cks . It is easily accessible to many Chicago features . The hotel staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Se ##dal ##ia was a great help with our luggage and making us get settled in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Spa ##cious , clean , nice design , simple breakfast included , well situated in downtown Chicago . Super comfortable king bed and co ##zy robes and towels . The design feels modern and appealing and well thought . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel positioned in the perfect part of town and near all the shops and great restaurants . I would stay here again whenever I stay in Chicago . Easy to get to using the train from the airport [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel 2 weekends ago . Everything was great expect for the fact my credit card was charged and I was never sent a bill . Tri ##ed calling and was told they couldn ' t find my bill . Em ##ailed and was never gotten back to . Absolutely unacceptable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel April 23 - 30 , 2017 . The staff was so nice and helpful . We loved the room . We requested a river view and enjoyed sitting in the windows ##eat and taking in the views . The wine happy hour each evening was a nice touch . House ##keeping was top notch . This was our first experience at a Kim ##pton property and we will definitely try their hotels in other cities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 1st time there for s ##t pat ##ty ##s weekend def . highly recommend staff was really nice room was nice and bathroom was cute and small but not too bad ! v ##alet was kinda price ##y but we did self parked across the street for way ##y cheaper but v ##alet was pretty nice ! only thing we didn ' t like was the elevator but overall everything went smooth ! we didn ' t really care much about getting a perfect room knowing we will be out al ##ot [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was charged a 1 night deposit on a fully re ##fu ##nda ##ble reservation without it being disclosed at the time of booking . When I cancelled the reservation they refused to reverse the Visa authorization so I loose on the double exchange rate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really nice hotel , decorated nicely and in a perfect location easy to walk to places from the hotel , we stayed two nights while traveling through America , the room was quite small but as we were staying a short time we didn ' t mind , the staff are great if you need recommendations on place to see and places to eat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the hotel with my family , very nice hotel , the room was big , the staff was very helpful , the hotel is walking distance to main attractions , nice restaurant all around . the hotel is clean , big lobby , nice bar [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great little bout ##ique hotel in the heart of Chicago . Right off W ##ack ##er Drive and W ##aba ##sh Avenue . Close to walk to Michigan Avenue Shop ##s downtown and even north of the River . Great views of the river from our room . A fantastic window seat to sit in - read and watch the boats on the river and the people passing by . Close to theatre district and many great restaurants as well . Don ' t miss their great wine hour ( free ) from 5 - 6 each night , [SEP]
0	[CLS] In these strange times , the staff was incredibly professional and friendly . Safety was clearly a priority . This hotel has one of the most exceptional indoor pools I have used . The details from 1929 are so pretty . Whole ##heart ##edly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] nice , clean , easy to do business with . stayed at 4 seasons , peninsula and other fine hotels , but Monaco Chicago definitely stands out from others . : ) Great staff . Each member of this hotel acknowledge ##s you with smiles and a nice touch of service [SEP]
1	[CLS] So the rooms itself , check in , general atmosphere , location is fine . It still really upset ##s me though that they charge a $ 10 receiving fee for any package they receive that has to go through a fed ##ex office in the building . This to me is unacceptable for a hotel at this price point and they don ’ t you this until you try and pick up the package . Also s ##ham ##po ##o , condition ##er and soap could be better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had problems with this hotel and indeed this is the second time . Re ##ception staff appear to be poorly trained and refuse to accept when they make mistakes . Re ##ception includes the bar and a lounge area where the carpet ##s are badly stained . Room ##s are small and cramped with basic fitting ##s . There is no room service so you have to go to the attached restaurant or coffee shop . I was disco ##nce ##rted seeing a case left in reception in the middle of a walkway for hours . When someone reported this to the reception they appeared di ##sin ##ter ##ested even though they did not know who it belonged to . After the lady who raised this was out of site they put it back in the same place they found it . That alone would be enough for me to not use this hotel but it was generally pretty average . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gold floor Manager Mu ##gi is the human em ##bo ##di ##ment of 5 stars . Except ##ional customer service . His staff are lovely and kind and incredibly knowledge ##able regarding the city of Chicago . I have stayed at multiple different Fair ##mont locations around the world , but the staff are what make ' s the Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park so special . This experience has cement ##ed my loyalty to the Fair ##mont chain , especially within Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our stay at the Talbot ##t Hotel started the weekend off right ! D , the bartender was so friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . . . . And De ##W ##ayne made us feel right at home . . . . . . The hotel is clean and nice and the staff makes the visit very comfortable ! We will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel with great location . Room ( a suite ) was very spacious but the bathroom was very narrow and tight . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast was crowded - had about a 10 minute wait to be seated . Didn ’ t have opportunity to use pool . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is in the perfect location in the heart of downtown Chicago . The staff is so nice and friendly . Vale ##t is too much 70 $ a night . You get a nice suite for a good price . and I really like the beverage service for select guests . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had to come to Chicago for business and decided to try this hotel . It is a historic hotel that is decorated in an art de ##co style . The room was a bit small , but I stayed alone . I had a room with a queen size bed , and on either side was a night table and a desk . The night table had 1 drawer with open space underneath . The desk has 3 small drawers . The TV was on top of a cabinet that held a refrigerator and had another 3 drawers . Being a luxury hotel , the room came with an umbrella and a bath ##robe . It also came with a hair dry ##er and an iron with and iron ##ing board . The furniture was old and in keeping with the hotel ' s historic nature . In all , the room was clean and comfortable and I enjoyed my stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] The wonderful hidden g ##em . The Talbot . Excellent location . Very clean house ##keeping . So ##fa should be removed in the suite and replaced with a work desk and chair . Excellent staff at check in and at the curb . Porter let us temporarily park our car until we went up to our room with our bags . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park has an excellent location with great friendly staff . However , the condition of the rooms are poor ( needs to be re ##mo ##del ##ed / re ##f ##resh ##ed as soon as possible ) . I had one of the access ##ibility room . Brown water came out of the bath tub that required running the water for over two minutes to clear it . The shower has multiple mold ##s . The cleaning staff did not do a great job of removing women ' s hairs on the floor from the prior guests ( I don ' t have long hair ) . Everything else needs to be re ##mo ##del ##ed / replaced ( furniture in the room , door handle , small elevator , etc . ) . Not sure why they still b ##oast about being one of the top 15 hotels in Chicago . Another draw back = no swimming pool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In a really good location , North Michigan Avenue close to shopping and tons of restaurants . O ##m ##ni Hotel offers good value for money . Staff was super friendly and helpful . Our go - to hotel when visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel ! Beautiful building of architectural interest , nicely decorated rooms and dedicated service with that French touch . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located close to Water ##tower and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! S ##light ##ly noisy Air ##con but I sleep with ear ##bu ##ds , so no problem at all ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , it was very nice . Things to improve upon : I was there for a business meeting , and there were fruit flies in the room and around the food . The meeting was setup with a U - shaped table arrangement . There were so many legs on the tables that there were barely enough places for people to sit . You can not sit at a table all day ( or even a couple hours ) when you have no where to put your legs . Your legs need to go under the table to reach your computer , etc . but with so many legs , we couldn ' t pull our chairs up close enough to the table . Also , round table cloth ##s were used on rectangular tables . There was so much extra fabric , people were getting their feet caught in it an trip ##ping . It was very uncomfortable . The staff and servers were wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I recently stayed ( 8 / 3 / 2019 ) overnight stay at the Palmer House for a wedding , we were in room 1824 ##6 . Although some what dated the room was still adequate , until you entered the shower . It appears that in their has ##te to re ##mo ##del the bathroom the staff decided to place the tub & shower liner in such a way that there was water in - between the old tub and liner . Taking a shower reminded me of my old water bed . When I need to stand on it to turn on the fan in my old bedroom . Need ##less to say that was 35 years ago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] as much the hotel itself is being charming and beautiful , so is it ' s staff . always helpful and kind and genuinely nice human beings . i wish i could just move in and stay forever . the quality of this hotel is above and beyond that i ever experienced anywhere else . thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a friendly place and they do try to make things a little different . Dec ##o is classic 30 ##s but in great shape . Lo ##bby and bar are nice and well frequented . They take care to keep this active . Room ##s are small and certainly lack a comfortable chair or a small sofa . You are confined to the comfortable bed . Bath ##s are functional and nice but very small . Location is great for downtown Chicago . Price level was okay on my stay . Downs ##ide : although part of I ##H ##G no recognition for Prior ##ity Club members . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we stayed at home ##wood suites for the third time this year on our visit to ch ##ica ##go for the s ##tric ##k ##ly sail show , and were very satisfied as always . Very friendly staff willing to do anything to make our stay enjoyable . we will return to this motel next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here during a festival in Grant Park . This location is close to everything downtown . The rooms are very nice , the food is good in the hotel and all around the hotel and there is great shopping very close . We stayed on the 29th floor and the views of the lake were spectacular . The elevators are really fast for such a high rise . We were impressed with everything . Very nice staff also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a wonderful hotel and the location is perfect . The only down ##side ##s are a $ 100 incident ##als fee at check in time and there ' s some re ##mo ##del ##ing being done , which didn ' t bother me , but might bother others . The Library is a wonderful place for relaxing , so I highly recommend spending time there . I ' m into minimal ##ism , so the all - white rooms are right up my alley . The beds are comfortable too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very good experience at the hotel . It was easy to access and having the breakfast and social hour , while not varied much , alleviate ##d some expense . Our room was small but do ##able , especially if you don ' t plan on spending much time there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great downtown Chicago location to use as a basis for tours , sights ##ee ##ing and in the center so so much that Chicago has to offer . We did this during the Easter weekend . We live in suburbs . Te ##rri ##fic views from the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very large room with two queen beds and plenty of space for all kinds of extra ##s . Hu ##ge pool that was heated with a locker room and changing area - - took our 3 grand ##ki ##ds and it was great ! Bar area was very nice on main level but we did not eat or drink there due to family events . Cafe for breakfast and pick up items was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting for coffee and breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] New property in a quiet area with small kitchen , nice de ##cor and excellent service . Weekend breakfast was scheduled from 7 - 10 am but they were nice and let me have breakfast until almost 10 : 30 . You are close to restaurants and amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first visit at the Hotel Monaco , and it is by far my new favorite hotel in Chicago ! First , the team there is outstanding ! Front desk Alexandra , Samantha , Eric , Gwen and Ronald - awesome ! Bell ##men , Dion and Conner so great , and Laura and Lorraine kept our room beautiful ! ! Second , the Fi ##sk - restaurant delicious ! Great staff lead by Amanda and Pay ##ton our server . Third - the Hotel is B ##EA ##UT ##IF ##U ##L ! ! Love ##d the Art Dec ##o feeling - but modern ! !

1	[CLS] First experience at this property and what a wonderful surprise . Obviously well located , this downtown hotel is modern , convenient and staffed with excellent people ! The Amazing ##ly Wonderful R ##ubi ##e At the front desk was pleasant , re ##sp ##ons ##ive and friendly . . . . she should have a long career in the hospitality industry . Additionally , the rooms are large , well appointed and fun . What a great place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this hotel many times . As Kim ##pton members , we get free w ##i - fi and the " raid the mini bar " option which means you can select an item of up to $ 10 from the mini bar for free . Every evening , they have a wine hour , with snack ##s and in the morning they offer free coffee . All day , there is compliment ##ary ice water in the lobby . The staff is very friendly and helpful . We always request a quiet room in the back . Bed ##s and pillows are comfortable and sleep quality is good . This is our " go to " hotel when we visit Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment my friend and I arrived to the very moment we left our experience here was awesome ! Victoria was who checked us in and she was a great help in every way . She made sure I had a great view to wake up to on my On my birthday . Vale ##t was great too ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely and historic property . We were on the 23rd floor which is an Executive Level floor that includes breakfast . The hotel needs re ##furbishment in some areas and this floor is one of them . When you walk out of the elevator towards your room , there is a strong smell of garbage . Something here needs to get addressed . The overall service in all areas of the hotel are excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is a great hotel . We ’ ve stayed as a family multiple times and the two room with pull ##out couch is great . Con ##cier ##ge outstanding . Will be back . Part ##icular ##ly recommend this hotel for families , but have used it on business as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A hotel with foundations on love ; a story that remains embraced in its walls and de ##cor of each and every corner of this beautiful detailed property where romance float ##s in the air . Cha ##rming set in the heart of the city wet ##her to stay or simply go for a drink at the lobby bar to enjoy el ##egan ##ce and comfort . . this is a must see iconic stop in your visit to Chicago . F ##abulous customer service . Thank you Tito ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ambassador Hotel is located in a truly beautiful neighborhood ( Gold Coast ) , yet it ’ s only minutes from the h ##ust ##le - bust ##le of downtown . It ’ s also very easily walk ##able from the Ambassador to Lake Michigan ( j ##og ##ging trail along the lake , sun ##bat ##hing , etc . ) . The hotel itself is very clean and the service is excellent . The first time we were there we got bumped up to the Pen ##thouse . It was exquisite and the whole place holds a lot of history . This is our go - to place whenever we are in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the front desk , to the v ##alet ##s , to the security , and wait staff - this hotel knows how to treat th ##ier guests ! The hotel was not fully opened yet , so we were a bit disappointed not having an in house bar / lounge to go to - certainly no fault of th ##iers ! And room service would have been great . . . another time [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Hotel Monaco Chicago for one night in June . The hotel itself was in a good location , and while the rooms are small , everything was clean and presented well . Park ##ing is reasonable , which is another bonus . The highlight of this hotel is their staff . I was very impressed with the level of customer service , and the staff was willing to go above and beyond to deliver to our expectations . Overall , I really enjoyed this hotel and would recommend to anyone traveling to downtown Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 8 nights . The room had a large bed with dressing area , wardrobe , bathroom , lounge , kitchen and dining table . Very well placed hotel . Hotel is very clean and all the staff we met were very pleasant . Breakfast is excellent and Monday to Thursday evenings they have an evening meal with wine or d ##raught beer which you help yourself to . Food was great . We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here last year at Christmas on a w ##him and loved it so much we decided to make it a tradition . The staff is wonderful , the rooms ( we were in executive tower ) are updated and very comfortable . You can ' t beat the location for holiday de ##cor and shopping . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had pre ##pa ##id my hotel through price ##line , but had dropped my wallet in my travels to Chicago so I was lacking ID and any credit to pay my incident ##als . The front desk spoke with Am ##ex to help prove my identity and cover the rest of the bill . The patience of the front desk staff was un ##f ##lag ##ging during a series of calls and updates . When I got to my room , I expected the odd corner that I will often get from bidding on price ##line , but I had an amazing view of the river ##front and a lovely room . It lowered my stress level considerably and made it feel more like a play day than a business trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A majority of services are not available but if you enjoy Chicago for the view as well as the local hot ##sp ##ots . This H ##ya ##tt is right on the water front and has good access to every major side of the Wind ##y City . I enjoyed my stay overall when we came for 3 nights [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love love love the de ##cor and am ##bian ##ce at The Public . Price is excellent . But the walls are thin . Service is not as on point as at Four Seasons , etc . But for the price , it is best in class . The P ##ump Room and Library bar are fantastic . Room ##s are spacious . The Public is my go - to in Chicago . I love the Gold Coast residential location even more than the location of , say , the W ##aldo ##rf . Such a special neighborhood . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was so looking forward to staying at the So ##fit ##el . It was absolutely worth it . Super ##b service and staff from start to finish . Room ##s are clean , comfortable , quiet and the location is great for exploring the city . After checking in I took the elevator to my room . One of the managers , Juan , also got on . He introduced himself as I told him how I was looking forward to my stay with them . He handed me his card and told me to call if there was anything I needed . Very nice touch ! I highly recommend the So ##fit ##el and look forward to my next stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this location multiple times and have never been let down by the room or amazing service that I have I received . It is a mix of a luxury bout ##ique hotel and an early 20 ' s / 30 ' s hotel you see in movies . All in all a great place to stay downtown if you have meetings , want to catch a show , or just taking in Chicago ##s sites and sounds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal for a family leisure trip into Chicago . Be ##ware , this hotel has two sections : The Grand Tower and The Executive Tower . The Grand Tower is filthy , and the Executive Tower leaves much to be desired . We stayed here n a King Suite in the Executive To ##we ##l and it was quite disappointing . Not cleaned well , amenities are those of a 2 star hotel . We actually had to request to have plastic bags put in waste basket ##s and to have linen ##s / towels brought to the room . Most areas are under construction . I would not recommend this hotel - extremely over ##p ##rice ##d for what you would expect from a hotel of this caliber . You will be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This location is perfect ! It cannot be beat . The hotel was bust ##ling with visitors during the Thanksgiving weekend . It was really a great time . I would definitely recommend it . It is a family friendly hotel too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Hotel on February 3rd room 112 ##3 for a concert at the house of blues . Clean hotel nice rooms good location good value for the money . I somehow left my Met ##ra monthly pass ( $ 210 value ) in my room . A big thank you to a K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker employee Marcus for calling me and getting my monthly pass back to me . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is beautiful and in a great location . The breakfast was delicious and the service was great . The unique , full - size indoor pool was wonderful . The rooms are very nice but a little small . I would definitely recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The view from my room on the 28th floor was great ! from check in to check out was a very pleasant experience . each time I called the operator I was addressed by my name . I had a special request and De ##met ##rius at Con ##cier ##ge honored it within minutes . Nick the bell ##man was the best , always court ##eous , very polite and persona ##ble . visited the gift shop twice and both ladies were pleasant and helpful in making my purchases ( didn ' t get their names ) will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for business . The hotel has been recently renovated and all the rooms are suites . The hotel is convenient ##ly located on Michigan Ave . Staff are very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Really great value for a decent price in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose this hotel due to the 4 star rating and location . The staff was helpful and friendly . A ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s were about average in our room , not 4 star . There was mold in the shower and no liner on the shower glass door to stop water from going all over the floor . The plug in the bathroom was dangerous due to the fact the whole thing was pushed into the wall from not being installed correctly . Didn ##t notice these things til the next morning when getting dressed . Not acceptable for a hotel charging over $ 300 night for a basic r ##om . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ben was amazing . He found us the perfect room and view we were looking for . He also recommended great restaurants . We also utilized the Vita ##lity program . Ben knew exactly what I was talking about and had the in room fitness items delivered to our room . The rooms are very clean and staff was amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed on business for three nights . An excellent hotel for business travelers , offering fast w ##if ##i , excellent fitness facilities , office space , and a delicious full breakfast b ##uff ##et , High ##ly recommend for anyone traveling on business to Chicago due to top amenities , large rooms , excellent service , and location . Will stay again on future travels to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is historic and beautiful . The rooms however are extremely small . If you can ' t fit a queen sized bed in the room . . . it ' s small . No room for a fridge , but they can squeeze a mini ##bar in . would not stay at or recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was the second year our group was at the hotel and it was another fantastic experience . The banquet ##s and events team are top notch and the food was yet again another hit with everyone who attended . I am sure we ' ll be back next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place was so ##oo ##o nice . My partner and I stayed for 3 short nights , and we wished we had more time ! ! The room was beautiful , cleaned everyday and the staff was super helpful with anything we needed ( e ##g sights to check out , nearby restaurants and places for man ##i / p ##ed ##i ) . Room service was a bit price ##y , but totally worth it ! ! Would definitely recommend staying here to friends and family . I wish I could give it 10 stars ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great stay here . I had an executive room on a high floor , which is the size of a large mini - suite of other hotels . It is a grand hotel for lack of a better term , where they have a ma ##je ##stic lobby that is great to see . Location is great for downtown attractions , also right by a loop stop . The walls do however seem on the thin side . I didn ' t have a problem , but some of the other reviews seem to indicate they had problems . The price is also pretty good for a downtown hotel as well . If you come with the appropriate expectations , and ask for a quiet room , you shouldn ' t be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A modern and spacious hotel close to river and Navy Pier . Some great views - rooms ending # 01 are by elevators ! Restaurant ##s and retail are within 5 - 10 min walk . Staff were helpful , gym is very good . Bar snack ##s were size ##able . Palm restaurant is located by Lo ##bby - good food + expensive [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , rooms and amenities are great , enjoyed my stay . Great location in the heart of the city . Vale ##t out front gave great restaurant recommendation the entire week . Everyone was very nice . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room had some noise from construction they were doing in the building . Kevin from guest care com ##ped a room for us because of the noise ! We were so impressed by his customer service , and will absolutely return and recommend the Swiss ##ote ##l ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago . The location can ’ t be beat right in the middle of Michigan Avenue . They upgraded our suite to the Presidential which was spacious and has amazing views . The O ##m ##ni has three star pricing with four star quality . Although still very nice , the hotel is probably due for a re ##f ##resh . We will come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotels location is perfect , right on the river and rooms with a great view . We were on the 29th floor and had an awesome view of navy pier . Also had a drink at the bar that night and the bartender ##s were great , had breakfast in Street ##er ##ville to top off the visit [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was lovely and the staff was very nice . We were there for a family event and the location and staff were excellent . I especially comment on D ##wayne - - - he was so nice and friendly , both with the adults and the kids . He really went out of his way to accommodate us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed in for a one night stay . Room was well laid out . Bed ##s were comfortable . Room had two bathroom ##s which was nice , each was well stock ##ed . Only draw ##back was limited shelf space in the baths . Will stay here again . Two thumbs up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came into town for a family wedding . Our family is very large and often hard to accommodate . Josh on the 6th floor at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in the double cross bar was amazing . He was very happy and loving life : - ) wish I could have spent more time hanging out there with him [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good value for money . Location was perfect ! The staff were kind and handled a situation I had prior to check - out without any hesitation or questioning . The hotel room was average , no bells or whistle ##s but comfortable - - particularly the bed . I will return for a later stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the reservations specialist , to the housekeeper , everyone was friendly & a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Gold upgrade is the way to go ! Although we didn ' t take advantage of them , the gold per ##ks were amazing ! Our room was very clean & the bed was extremely comfortable ! The gold lounge was the perfect extra to our trip ! Location is also the best here - just a short walk to Mel ##len ##ium Park & Navy Pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed my five - night stay at the Hilton Chicago , a lovely historic hotel in a convenient location . Am ##ple elevators , lovely public rooms , large guest room , good bathroom in the room , smart layout , comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Except ##ional Hotel , clean , quite , room size and views were amazing . Everyone was very polite and extremely professional . Did not have one complaint . Very busy with multiple conferences going on during my stay but you could not tell unless you happened to be around when the conferences brake ##d for the day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location with easy access to major Chicago attractions such as Millennium Park , the Chicago Institute of Art , Field Museum of Natural History , She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , and Soldier Stadium . This site appears to focus on the conference crowd so it lack a comfortable lounge options for sitting privately and reading . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A friend who lives in the Gold Coast recommended this hotel to me based on his experience at the bar there . The bar was great . The hotel rooms themselves were garbage . I booked a " del ##uxe " room that was tiny , with dirty carpet and a dirty bathroom . I was changed to a different room on a higher floor , as my original room backed up to a trash alley , but it was just as disappointing . The bathroom de ##cor was chip ##ping . The sink did not drain . There were din ##gs and den ##ts on all of the walls . There was a stain of unknown origins on the floor . It ' s in a great location , but this is not a luxury hotel by any means . Do not waste your time staying here . Get a drink at the bar , but rest your head elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient location , super friendly and helpful staff ( shout out to Craig ! ) , comfortable rooms . Only thing missing was free w ##if ##i in the rooms . Lounge area had a piano music and jazz band one evening - nice touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 7 nights at H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago . The hotel is a great one , but it is next to a Fire Station . The lower floor facing the street side ( vs . river ) have loud and disturbing sire ##ns at nights - not able to sleep well . The hotel should disc ##lose it when guests check in . We will not stay at this hotel in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Let ' s start with the good things about this hotel - location , gym , es ##press ##o drinks in the morning , great staff , very comfortable bed , great facilities for conferences . Moving on to the things that need improvement - the rooms are dated , years or dust under furniture , carpet coming up along walls , mold in the shower ##s , ripped up chair , barely anything healthy or ve ##get ##arian on the room service menu or on ##site restaurant . The Fair ##mont name carries a certain aura with it , but this hotel just doesn ' t meet expectations . For the price , you are better off choosing one of the other lovely hotels in the area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wow ! Hotel accommodation ##s were outstanding ! When we stepped out of our vehicle - we were met by the friend ##liest men who warmly welcomed us . They took care of our vehicle and our luggage - as well as showed us up to our rooms - and made sure we had everything we needed . D ##wayne was especially helpful , kind and most a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . He helped us with late check out and made it possible for us to extend our adventures for the day ! Beautiful hotel and the friend ##liest staff ! ! We will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice and convenient to everything we were doing . The only down ##side were the elevators . Be aware that you will need extra time and to make sure you are ready to s ##wi ##pe your key to go up to your room . Many people were having issues with the elevator not recognizing their key . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent 5 days at this property for a professional conference . My experience was exceptional - the staff was at ##ten ##tive and friendly . In particular , the server at the coffee bar made me feel appreciated . She remembered my usual order , and went out of her way to satisfy the customers . The con ##cier ##ge was also very helpful . No complaints . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lou ##d noise from the bridge constantly and I asked them to fix the a ##c because my room was burning up and I don ' t think they even stopped by . No note was left , no voice ##mail ; nothing . The the ##rm ##ost ##at said it was 67 and it definitely was not . Not a comfortable stay at all [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location , but the hotel is very old and must ##y . The pool and hot tub were shut down . The health club was nice , but very over ##crow ##d with locals that are member in the morning and was not able to use el ##liptic ##al machine . Over ##p ##rice ##d and took forever to check in . I am still waiting for my email re ##ceipt for my stay after 3 calls to front desk , still do not have it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great rooms ! My wife and I went for our anniversary . Had dinner , drinks , and after she stopped trying to argue with me , a fantastic evening ! Can ' t wait to visit the hotel again . Dinner at the hotel was very good as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed everything about our stay . Clean , spacious rooms , Gorge ##ous bathroom , fantastic views and wonderful ##ly friendly staff . It ’ s in a prime location too ! I have stayed in other Conrad hotels around the world , and this one did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint : ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] My expectations for this hotel was way to high for the stay we had , it was horrible ! Check in , and v ##alet was great . We checked in late so we didn ’ t get to upgrade like we were hoping for . Once we made it into the room the floor still had c ##rum ##bs of food left on it . The linen on the bed had make up on it and the bathroom wasn ’ t too clean . The manager did come up to look and had the housekeeper re - clean the room . We also were put by the housekeeper area and all night we heard the door open and slam . The up ##ke ##ep in the room was horrible I felt like I was staying at a 2 star hotel . However , we were accommodate ##d for the in ##con ##ven ##ience ##s , but it was just one too many times that we had to complain . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l is located in a great location ; we walked most places we wanted to go ( A ##qua ##rium , Field Museum , Symphony , etc . ) . The view was great even without up ##grading to lake or river view room ( recommend the south side rooms ) . The room was very clean and spacious and the bed was one of the most comfortable I ' ve ever slept on in a hotel . Staff were very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife live just outside Chicago isn ’ t the “ b ##ur ##bs ” . As a gift she surprised me with a tour of W ##rig ##ley Field and a Cubs game later that day . We decided at the last minute to stay downtown and a stay ##cation out of our trip . Due to Lal ##apa ##lo ##za going on this weekend rooms were at a premium if you could find them . The Hotel Al ##egro was great , price was reasonable , service imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , and our room had all we could ask for based on availability . Easy walk to all the normal places and plenty of parking lots . Will definitely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a King Suite which was very comfortable . The lighting around the mirror in the bathroom could have been better but otherwise the room was very comfortable and Q ##UI ##ET . Would definitely stay there again . At ##tended a wedding in the Crystal Ball ##room - W ##OW ! What a beautiful room ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wife and I made a day trip to the city to celebrate Valentine ' s Day . We were treated to an amazing room overlooking the street below . The room was very clean . The morning breakfast started the day off right . The hotel is also pet friendly and it was nice to bring our puppy with us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For visiting Millennium Park , the museums or the shows , this is a great place to stay . Very handy to Lakes ##hore Dr as well . Not too bad for places north of downtown . Do seem to get a fair amount of sire ##n activity from the fire ##house across the street is th only negative . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel provides a lovely and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting venue for a conference . I was there for a three day business meeting and was impressed by the g ##rac ##ious ##ness of the staff . This hotel has a Star ##bu ##cks attached which is most convenient when dealing with afternoon meeting fatigue . It is convenient ##ly located around restaurants and shopping . The bell ##man are quick to get a cab for you or help with bags . The food provided during the meetings was superior to most conference or meeting offerings . I would happily return to this hotel for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conference from 11 / 7 - 11 / 10 in 2018 . Facility was beautiful and accommodation ##s were comfortable . G ##ym was excellent . View ##s were amazing . Front desk staff Chris and Ra ##quel went above and beyond to assist with needs that came up during my stay , and did so with great kindness . ( i . e . , zero eye - rolling or making me feel like I was an in ##con ##ven ##ience , which , to be clear , I totally was ! ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room itself is very de ##pressing . The walls are barren except for three 8 ##x ##10 inch pictures of cows that literally fell off the wall in the middle of the night , because some genius thought that double sided tape would hold a framed piece of paper on the wall vs . using actual hardware . The w ##if ##i is slower than dial up . there is nothing special about this place . I would not choose it again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a Really nice hotel the rooms are large and nice and the bathroom were super nice and clean bar area was elegant the hotel is located in the heart of everything coffee was good they have a social hour which is mice [SEP]
1	[CLS] Custom ##er service was great and the rooms are clean and brand new . Eric gave us exceptional service and the rest of staff was friendly . It ' s a great location , located next to many stores , restaurants , and other hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ask ##ed management to have a / c fixed as room would not cool below 78 . Engineering attempted to repair but stated system was old and in need of replacement as hallway system was very cool . Ask ##ed for change of room but was told there was no room available as hotel was fully booked . Hard pressed to stay there again if that is how they respond to a problem ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything was excellent , just as planned . We have stayed with you in the past and will surely do so again in the future . The personnel were wonderful . The am ##bian ##ce was most pleasant . The hospitality was outstanding . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was very nice , in a great location , and the staff was friendly , but I didn ' t notice when I booked that the rate did NO ##T include a resort fee of $ 25 plus tax . I feel mi ##sle ##d - Thanks Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Heads up if you stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel . . . great location , friendly staff , good on - site restaurants . Just a few minutes walk to Millennium Park , right across the street from the River ##walk . Room ##s were spacious , comfortable , and clean . We would definitely stay there again . Lane ##tte , who was one of the check - in staff members , was incredibly persona ##ble ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Palmer House is in a great location and is a beautiful old hotel , my room was a great size with two shower ##s but the room was a bit dated and needs re ##f ##reshing . They provided priority lifts to my floor but the lifts are small and old . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quick check - in and departure . Co ##m ##fort ##able room . Good position . Easy for a taxi . What a pleasure to get a pot of ready - made tea rather than a j ##ug of te ##pid water and a tea ##bag . Some very strange sa ##usage fl ##av ##ours at breakfast - why can ' t sa ##usage ##s just taste of sa ##usage ##s , why do they have to have fruit in them ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose to stay here because of their pool : it ’ s really spectacular ! We came during the week and there were hardly any other guests , so we had the pool to ourselves . Our room was clean and quiet and the front desk staff called shortly after we arrived at our room to make sure everything was in order . The refrigerator in our room was set to a much higher temperature than we are used to and the outside of our window had not been cleaned in a while , but otherwise , there isn ’ t really much to complain about . Park ##ing is a bit of a has ##sle ( you have to use a garage which is a block away ) , but we knew about that before we booked our room . Because of CO ##VI ##D - 19 , there was no breakfast b ##uff ##et , but we received v ##ou ##chers for the Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el on E . Ch ##est ##nut in the Ma ##g Mile area is a beautiful , well appointed hotel which is my new favorite in the area . Staff was very pleasant and helpful . The beds were like clouds . The view of the John Hancock was stunning . What a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one night to attend a business meeting and really enjoyed the experience . Nice location , great service and friendly employees throughout my stay in all areas of the hotel . Had a suite that was nicely furnished with views of the lake and a corner of Millennium Park . Although the room showed some signs of wear , I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues . [SEP]
0	[CLS] wasn ##t worth the money , our family weekend escape to the city fell extremely short of our expectations . Probably will start looking for new hotel to stay at when i come to the city . It definitely didn ##t live up to a four star hotel as its advertised . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was hosting several conferences / conventions . Long lines at check - in and overwhelmed / over ##loaded bag storage facilities while waiting for room to become available . On the plus side , breakfast and lunch at the hotel restaurant were exceptional . Room ##s on the expensive side and $ 69 / night to park ? ! ? ! ? ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was probably my fifth time staying at the Talbot . I ' ve seen it before and after the renovations . They ' ve done a great job up ##dating the hotel . There has always been great service from the staff and great a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From check ##in to check ##out , both Joshua and Lane ##tte at front desk along with Hazel in house ##keeping made our trip superb ! At the Am ##use bar , bartender Eddie ( if I remember correctly ) was interesting , engaging and at ##ten ##tive . Will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are there to shop , Michigan avenue is right around the corner . there to do anything else , you are close to it . Great hotel , staff is fantastic { however you would expect to check in at 4 : 00 on a Sunday and your room is ready , not wait till almost 6 : 00 } . Floor designs are a bit q ##ui ##rky with lots of corners , but well worth it when you step in the nice quiet clean room . I stay quite often at the O ##m ##ni brands and this one definitely does not fail . The real down ##side would be if you are driving , I think v ##alet { only offered } parking is $ 75 . 00 a night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I recently celebrated our 26th wedding anniversary at the Fair ##mont Chicago and had the pleasure of staying in a Gold floor king suite . The rooms are spacious and the welcome champagne and straw ##berries in our room and turn ##down service made for a romantic weekend . High ##ly recommend the Gold floor lounge for relaxing , great breakfast and afternoon can ##ap ##és . Big thanks to Jesus and Man ##dela ##na for their at ##ten ##tive service and helpful tourist advice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Conrad with family in December 2018 . Everything was impressive . From the service to the rooms and other facilities . The restaurants and bar are nice and the availability of food too ! ! The service and behavior of staff was outstanding and stood out to us ! ! Park ##ing is expensive at 70 $ but what can be done when you stay steps away from the Ma ##g mile and that too with in - out privileges . Overall , great stay and Its a favorite place to stay in Chicago for me now ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had to stay at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Hotel one late night , no reservation . K ##wa ##me was at the front desk and treat us very well . He found us a room and matched the price with competitors . Unfortunately , the room was not set up ( reason I give 4 stars ) . Wen ##t down , talked to K ##wa ##me and he found us another room ( upgrade ) . Best service experience ! Room service and room condition were excellent . In general , I recommend this hotel quality - price [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the Talbot Hotel was friendly and at ##ten ##tive . The food and am ##bian ##ce in the bar was top notch . The room was clean , nicely appointed and had an excellent TV . I ’ ll be back ! The location is within easy walking distance to many of the highlights Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we checked in , overall wonderful experience . Staff was top notch and always friendly . We did the park and play package with city views and found it cost effective . Great location as well . Would recommend this location to anyone . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago is an awesome place ! The customer service was way beyond what I was expecting and hotel staff were very court ##eous , polite , and professional . I would recommend this hotel to everyone for sure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , very close to restaurants , shopping , and transportation . The room was very nice , had a tub and separate shower . When we checked in the front desk was helpful and offered us help in finding places on our visit . We would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wife and I want to go Christmas shopping and there is no better place to stay in Chicago than the O ##m ##ni . It is central ##ly located on Michigan Ave , with easy access to all of the shops via cab or walking . Clean corner suite gave us an amazing view . P ##lent ##y of room to spread out . Food was always hot when it arrived , service was excellent and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We look forward to coming back to the O ##m ##ni - Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ho ##rrible the shower lining had no magnet ##s to stay against tub so while i was shower ##ing the shower lining kept flying n the way . The f ##rig was full of price ##y l ##iq ##our no where for me to my juice and water this hotel should really get rid of carpet . This hotel has no compliment ##ary breakfast but a rest ##ura ##nt where breakfast is severed $ $ $ . room size small i wanted a view of the river and lake mi ##chi ##gan n the back of the hotel but instead the room location was a con ##truction site across the street aka street view only . this hotel said it had a sa ##una well it must b hidden i never found it . Oh and i got stuck n the elevator don ##t ruin your vacation at this dump oh hot water was the only treat and the bed was ok . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont is an excellent hotel and the staff are very welcoming ! The Fair ##mont is in a great location as it is close to Michigan Avenue , Mill ##eni ##um Park and Navy Pier . We had an excellent " Anniversary " experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived very late for check , and encountered some hi ##cc ##ups ( all on our end , not the hotel ) but the staff was very helpful . Mr . C ##rook ##s , the night manager was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and got us checked in . We ’ d driven in from Little Rock , AR so we weren ’ t on our A game , but they saved the day . The room was very clean and house ##keeping did a great job each day . T ##ip : ask for a top sheet if your accustomed to one . The bed was so comfortable , and the shades kept out all light . When we return the only things we will change is staying on a higher floor and possibly a bigger room ( though the room size is good for a European style hotel ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were staying in Chicago to attend the Georgia / Notre Dame football game in South Bend , IN . I found the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker on line , loved the location and the special pricing on a junior suite made it a great choice . It was within walking distance to everything we wanted to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Home ##wood suites are a very comfortable option for long stays . This location was exceptional . Al ##bei ##t Very expensive to park your car , check out other parking options . Con ##ven ##ient downtown location . We felt safe walking around , . Great staff including the breakfast staff who went out of their way to make you feel welcome . A special k ##udo for Jeremy who was not just performing his job to the best of his ability but also made guests welcome and gave a glad you are here attitude . We only ate the evening meal once , it was flavor ##ful and filling . Much better than some Home ##wood Suite ##s . Our room was comfortable and cleaned daily . My only complaint is The pillows which are routinely uncomfortable in Hilton properties , too soft , too hard , never just right for me . The elevator was speed ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is Beautiful ! We spent a 4 day weekend there for the Air and Water Show and were completely satisfied with everything it has to offer . The king suite room was perfect and the bedroom was un ##believable . It has a huge bathroom , living room with mini fridge and a computer desk . Put on the bath robes if you really want to feel important ! It has a bar / restaurant , nice gym and pool with a rooftop deck just outside the gym . Its also located in the heart of downtown so you are close to everything . De ##fin ##ite ##ly worth the money if you can afford it . I would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved the Hilton Chicago ! It was in a very convenient location ! The view was nice and the room was very clean ! The food was very good ! The suite had a fridge and kitchen ##ette . The lobby area was elegant and re ##f ##reshing ! The ballroom was on the large with an excellent sound system . The café was nice ; There was a Star ##bu ##cks inside also ! I highly recommend your staying at this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in Chicago for the weekend . We normally stay at the Intercontinental on Michigan . We come back because of the wonderful people we meet like Will . We had several encounters with Will and while he hailed us a cab we found him delight ##ful to talk to . Thank you for making our stay special ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Public was perfect . The architecture and design fl ##aw ##less , the common spaces welcoming , the staff friendly , informed and helpful , the rooms spacious , the location super ##lative and the overall v ##ibe was exactly what I look for in a hotel . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was very Clean . Beautiful Room . Bath ##room could use a little update . Great Service . Love the Din ##ing area . Hotel Staff was very friendly . Check in and out was fast . Hotel staff court ##eous . Hotel itself was state of the Art . Location of hotel was close to Michigan Ave . Restaurant ##s in the area was convenient . Just overall the Best stay for shopping restaurants site seeing . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I get nervous about staying in “ historic ” hotels , because that can often mean “ old , c ##reak ##y and past their prime ” . But the Palmer has done a good job of keeping current , while still emphasizing its history . The rooms are solid , up - to - date , and in relatively good condition . It ’ s a unique place to stay , and you really get a sense of Chicago history and that by ##gon ##e era . Would have no problem returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was old , dirty and most of the staff was rude . I took photos of the 30 + m ##os ##quito ##es that were on the desk , window shade and ceiling . Luckily the bed was comfortable or else this would have been equivalent to a low class motel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , staff is great . Palm ##R ##esta ##ura ##nt is great ! Check out the state of the art fitness center . The views from our room was amazing . The new suites are second to none , a must book for your stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was amazing and offered such great advice on tours and food options . The hotel is perfectly located for a lot of walking options . A ton of wonderful restaurants within a block or two . Shopping was close by as well . The only draw ##back and it ’ s minor , which comes from my builder husband , was they should fix the poor job of wall ##paper ##ing in the bathroom . Too late to fix , but may we suggest doing it over with a better company . They did not do your hotel justice . It ’ s evident in other areas the upgrades were spared no expense . Just a suggestion . By no means would this keep us from coming back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay at the Conrad . Great check in staff . Was checked in by a woman who could speak Japanese , didn ’ t catch her name . Very warm welcome . As a diamond , she immediately looked for ( and found ) a tier upgrade . She discussed all the Diamond benefits at the Conrad , which are among the best in the US ( $ 30 / person up to $ 60 total for food / beverage / room service ) . Room was quiet though was on 15th floor . When re ##ser ##ving I thought the hotel colors were a bit dated but in person I thought it looked good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I cannot rate this hotel high enough ! It ’ s close to everything you need in Chicago ! The lobby is fantastic and a nice place to hang ##out in and have drinks in the evening . Staff was phenomena ##l and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . When you check in you get texts asking how everything is and the responses are always quick when you have questions . The nice ##st Hilton hotel I ’ ve stayed in ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a fun overnight here this weekend . This bout ##ique style hotel had great customer service , clean , spacious rooms and a generous happy hour with a nice selection of meat ##s , cheese ##s , olive ##s and more . Way better than the typical bowl of p ##eanut ##s and chips served at other places ! I also enjoyed the continental breakfast set out on each floor - can just put on a robe ( provided in the room ) and walk over by the elevators and take a nice breakfast back to your room ! Used to stay at the Mar ##riot ##s near Michigan Ave , but I think I will be staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie from now on ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I were here as part of our vacation . The room it self was nice . Our view was looking directly right in to the hotel room across from us . So the view was not good at all . The people in the room next to us were very noisy , they had kids that they kept yelling at and slamming doors . The toilet in the bathroom had a large crack at the base that looked so bad . And as far as parking your car , it cost us $ 70 . 00 a day . On our second day there we left early and when we got back late afternoon it was obvious that the room had not been cleaned . I called house ##keeping and they did send someone right up to take care of it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am hooked on Kim ##pton Hotels . Everyone who works at a Kim ##pton hotel seems to be doing it because they enjoy it . The wine hour is such a draw for me . I try to never miss it . The manager Jordan made me feel like he was welcoming me into his home as he handed me a glass of prose ##cco . And having an ice machine on every floor helps this weary travel ##er . The gym is well appointed and gives me no excuse for missing my work ##out . Working on an event at The Cadillac Palace Theatre next door , I could not have been closer unless I was on stage . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our room was nice . . The staff are very , very professional and helpful . Chicago is a big city but this hotel make you feel at home and like you are the most important person in the world . I could not say enough things about the helpful staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for three nights and it was good enough . Staff was friendly as well and it was a smooth check in . The only that concerned me was the bathroom stall floors which seemed a bit mold ##y / had soap s ##cum that ’ s black . Wish ##ed it was a bit cleaner in the bath stall but overall it wasn ’ t terrible . Overall it was a good stay . We only needed to sleep so we didn ’ t really care for anything fancy . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el Chicago was the B ##OM ##B . com . I spent three nights at the hotel and I have enjoyed all the services . Everything was on point . The staff , the little f ##rench they know was so funny to me as I speak f ##rench but it was good to see the smile ##y face in the AM with the ( Bon ##jou ##r ) and PM with the ( Bon ##so ##ir ) . I totally recommend this place and I will definitely be back in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was an absolute dream - the room was spacious and quiet with beautiful views of Chicago . Emily at the front desk was incredibly welcoming and Gene was very helpful in answering my questions and giving recommendations . The hotel is in such a prime location , with great shopping and restaurants nearby - and Michigan Avenue is just steps away ! I will definitely be staying at the Talbot ##t again the next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quite central . Co ##m ##fort ##able room with really nice pillows . Pleasant employees . Don ' t like that the menu in the restaurant on the 20th floor is some days just bar bites . R ##oof ##top restaurant food is good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay ! Friendly staff , spacious rooms , great location , loved the compliment ##ary breakfast and happy hour Mon - T ##hur ##s . Wish they had better drink selection and they had a hot tube by the pool . The pool was warm and the view was amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in required $ 75 per night on my credit card for over priced snack and water , totally unnecessary . Lou ##d hotel despite signs requesting quiet . Room service staff were great and the food lack lust ##er . My room had a door and at 113 ##0 PM someone entered my adjoining room used a key to try and open the room to my room ! It ' s hard enough to sleep and that made it impossible . When I informed staff they gave me exactly what I thought they would , they really don ' t give a s ##x ##x ##t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , good price and great service . We loved the happy hour and complementary morning coffee ( good coffee ) . The hotel is imp ##ec ##ca ##bly designed , large rooms and fun de ##cor . Staff were lovely , helpful and gave good local advice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I came to this hotel on a weekend trip for a wedding . Check in was easy and the con ##cier ##ge had a lot of information / fun facts about Chicago which made out short stay fun . He recommended pizza which was spot on ! ( Thank you for that ) The room was clean and co ##zy . My husband and i particularly liked the toilet ##ry . I know that ’ s something many people don ’ t really comment on that but the quality of it was worth mentioning . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The stay at the Hilton Chicago was very pleasant . I enjoyed the Irish Bar great place to meet with friends and co - workers . Area is very nice great walk up and down Michigan Ave . Park across the street makes for a nice walk . Room ##s are nice comfortable . I would stay there again if I return to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location if you are going to see Hamilton or Mill ##eni ##um Park or just Downtown Chicago . Great lobby with Star ##bu ##cks and some nice views . It is less than a 10 minute w ##lk to the lake ##front / Mi ##ching ##an Avenue [SEP]
1	[CLS] Called ahead to let the hotel know I ' ll be arriving after midnight . I was greeted at reception by the same person who had greeted me two weeks prior . And she recognized me and had my key ready . Very friendly and helpful . Location is close to where meetings were being held . Very nice lobby . I certainly felt welcome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel , very well located , close to the parks , river , and shows . They offer you free bicycle and if you have time you can be around and discover this ma ##gni ##fies city . I would return to this hotel for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was able to stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker while in Chicago for a girls weekend and the location was te ##rri ##fic . We were able to easily get to the lake shore and also all the shopping we could want . The bar downstairs was quiet and comfortable . We even decided to watch the Oscar ##s in the bar which was great . The bartender searched high and low to find mint for a m ##o ##jit ##o but he found it and mixed a great drink . My only real complaint with the hotel was the exercise room . There were four t ##read ##mill ##s but only one was working . There were three el ##liptic ##al machines and only one worked . There were five people trying to work out at the same time so that made it difficult . Other than that , this is a really great place to stay while in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Even though the pool , j ##ac ##uz ##zi , and spa are closed , there are more than enough amenities available to make it a great experience ! Ben V . suggested that I up - grade to a corner room , and I am glad that I took his suggestion - - such great views ! If you want an un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble view - - do the upgrade for $ 60 ! Total ##ly worth it ! The Palm is open ( again ) , and we had a glorious dinner - - don ' t skip eating there ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quick V ##aca ##tion to Chicago , 2 Nights . Excellent location , helpful staff . The hotel bar and restaurant had Excellent food and beverage . We had a Great weekend get ##away . Room ##s were spacious and well appointed . Bed ##s were very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall this is a nice hotel … Believe it or not the shining spot in my stay was the v ##alet they were amazing … but w ##ow is it expensive . . . . . The rooms are huge and spacious very nice after the re ##mo ##del … But the staff really leaves something to be desired the check in service was pretty good but the check ##out was not great . . . . . . And my bill was wrong they charged me more than $ 100 from my quoted rate … Which I didn ' t find out until I checked my email re ##ceipt because they don ##t print one for you … However I must say when I called back to the hotel they were great and they corrected it right away . . . . my overall experience I would say was a 3 it ' s OK for the money and location [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice and reasonable but our room faced an alley and the garbage trucks were out at 630 ##am and stayed for 40 minutes . I told the staff but they were un ##res ##po ##ns ##ive almost like they didn ' t care . So really poor service and loud room - otherwise place was ok [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , right on Michigan a ##ve , by restaurants and shopping . Great staff very friendly , at check - in requested pillows and they were sent to my room almost before I got there . Jordan ##s Restaurant is amazing the steak ##s are incredible . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been staying at the She ##rato ##n for a number of years and some of the staff have reached out to me over the years offering their help and service . Occasionally I ' ll reach out to one or more of them with a special request ( like early check ##in ) and they are always very re ##sp ##ons ##ive and helpful . This hotel has become like my home in Chicago , where I travel for business often ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location . It is close to shopping and great restaurants . Everything is walk ##able . The room was clean , luxurious , and comfortable . Love ##d the automatic shades which afforded shade during the hot day . We had a lovely view of the John Hancock building . Great shower too . Service was also impressive . I would definitely stay there again ! [SEP]

The staff was super friendly and we had no issues . Having a p ##lent ##iful breakfast every mint ##ing was definitely value added . I will be back to stay , without a doubt ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a three day break and stayed at this hotel . Great location in the middle of everything . Hotel nice , not great but it did the trick . Ex ##pen ##sive mini bar so be ##ware . Strange choice of carpet ##s on floors gives the impression of being thread bear but I think it was just a very strange pattern . Love ##ly staff . Clean and smart older style hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the hotel and all the staff ! This is our hotel of choice now after staying in various for family trips . Very nice staff and I had a recent issue with another hotel down the street .

Also the bar made me the best Manhattan I have ever had . Thanks to the wonderful people and beautiful rooms ! ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] A little off the magnificent mile - but I think its quiet ##er because of that and its still close to the main attraction . Love ##d the bath amenities - and the room was modern and spacious . B ##runch was great - come with an appetite and try to c ##rois ##san ##ts ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a week for a conference . Service at check in and the con ##cier ##ge was very good . The hotel is in a great location . Easy walk to Navy Pier and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . I really enjoyed having a drink at the bar in the evening . Great staff and it was large enough that it never felt too crowded . I would stay here again if I am ever back in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I arrived with lost luggage - that means no luggage ! I ##mme ##dia ##te sympathy and an offer to chase up the airline while I relax after a long journey .

I loved this hotel . And I ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a perfect spot for shopping . The staff was very friendly and helpful . The rooms were very large and clean . We came for the American Girl package for my granddaughter ##s birthday and the extra amenities really made her day special . We had rooms on different floors but they were both queen suites with lots of room . The hotel is old which has pro ##s ( great architecture , room size ) and con ##s ( sliding door to the bathroom , a bit noisy ) . But overall we loved this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the location is fantastic to see the city . The breakfast is worth the cost and has great food . We had two adjoining rooms and this was a perfect layout for a family of 6 ! We will be back ! p . s . find a package that includes breakfast and v ##alet . . . individually for a family of 6 this represents about 200 $ a day ( 25 $ breakfast and 72 $ for v ##alet ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely perfect from the minute we pulled up . Antonio the door man introduced himself immediately , super polite and at ##ten ##tive immediately . David at the desk was spot on . Room was large , beautiful , clean , all amenities in their place and the large bed was fantastic . Every encounter over 4 days was above and beyond any other hotel experience . We had no problem bonding with the staff , will not stay anywhere else in Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago is tucked away in a very residential area of the Gold Coast , which makes it unique for a Chicago hotel . While quiet , the location is just a couple of blocks from some of the area ' s best restaurants and shopping . The rooms here are small and are relatively basic , but the restaurant , coffee bar and shared spaces in the hotel are excellent . We enjoyed drinks at the bar as well as dinner in The P ##ump Room restaurant . The service was great , and the food was delicious . High ##ly recommend this hotel as an alternative to those in the River North and Street ##er ##ville areas of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price we paid ( well over $ 200 . 00 ) I expected a great stay with few negative ##s . A lost reservation at the very start , no pool , no fitness center , no casual restaurant , ( which were advertised as included ) , a bar that closed at 11 : 00 , and a dusty - looking lobby were too many negative ##s to warrant this price . A large , clean , ( although ho - hum looking ) room with a fantastic view were on the positive side , as was the good location to the Chicago life we came for . I would choose another hotel next time . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As am inter ##continent ##al ambassador , we have chosen to stay at this hotel for the first time when we planned our visit to Chicago . We are very impressed with how perfect this hotel is ! Location is just a walking distance to shopping , food , and many attractions . Excellent service from arrival till departure . Our guest room is beautifully decorated , bedroom very quiet and bed so comfortable . We highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing but positive things to say about this hotel and as long as Ken ##dal Young ' s there I ' ll keep going back . Help ##ed my group out with an early check in so many thanks . From check in to out the value of this hotel is fantastic . Lo ##ads of great shopping in the area and 5 minute walk from a F ##ogo de Chao . B ##ike ##s available in reception , super super com ##fy beds , clean rooms . G ##ym : card ##io and loose weights only so could do with a few resistance machines ( they have the space ) but overall does the job . [SEP]
1	[CLS] River - facing rooms have stunning views , and the staff promptly respond to all requests . The gym is big , the hotel has two towers and vast lobby areas with lounge ##s , perfect for Winter stays . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Construction - - was not told at booking or check - in about the construction . There was a folded piece of paper in the corner of my massive room that mentioned construction started at 9 ##am . Not only is that not a sufficient notice of the work being done , but also , construction started at 8 ##am , not 9 and it was un ##bearable to work from my room during . Before I knew it I was standing in a towel with a construction worker hanging outside of my window looking in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If one word should qualify this hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago : excellence . This modern cost q ##ui ##è ##te hotel makes you feel home straight away . + + + everything is though for business lady as well say hello as lady hang ##ers . . . . umbrella , great bath ##robe ##s and lovely bathroom products . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay The negative was that it was before the city was fully open and some services were not yet open . The rooms are none smoking but with pot now legal in Chicago guests maybe need a reminder that no smoking means no smoking [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was wonderful , from the tie we walked in until the time we checked out . There was even a mistake in charging me W ##if ##i and the lady took care of it right away . . . no questions asked . The location is great and within walking distance or a short cab ride to almost anything . In addition to my husbands beloved Bears winning , made the trip even better ! ! We will definitely be back ! Thank you ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our stay was great . we really enjoyed the room , the staff , and the excellent food at Michael Jo ##rdon ' s St ##eak ##house . The service from all the staff we encountered was friendly and always helpful . I would not hesitate to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed at this hotel several times and usually find it satisfactory . Lo ##bby is large with several options to sit and get food and / or drink . My room this time was not as I ' d expect - air conditioning didn ' t work - had to call for service . Location tucked in an alley ##way so overlooked a wall and exterior stairwell . Car ##pet made me nervous . Glad didn ' t have to stay long [SEP]
0	[CLS] I would absolutely recommend the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker hotel to anyone looking for a FA ##B ##U ##L ##O ##US , F ##UN and Dec ##ade ##nt experience . I surprised my man on our 1 year anniversary to a suite at M ##K ##H and it more than exceeded my expectations . Si ##ze was more than ample . Am ##eni ##ties were modern and plus ##h . Bed ##ding was amazing ( best night sleep I ' ve gotten in months ) . . . . price was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I can ' t say anything bad . The staff was nice and welcoming . I will definitely be back ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a wonderful weekend get ##away at The Talbot ##t ! The hotel is the perfect location to experience everything Chicago has to offer . The service from the beginning of the stay to the departure was perfect . I can ' t recommend The Talbot ##t enough ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel should be a top choice for travelers . The only down ##er was breakfast . Could be a bit fresh ##er and more varied . Room ##s are extremely clean . Modern furnishings and plenty of electrical outlets . House ##keeping staff efficient and friendly . The front desk employees are friend ##lier than some you may find at a family reunion . They are extremely helpful and interested in your daily activities . The hotel location is within walking distance of many attractions - - only one block from the river walk - - as well as excellent restaurants . Would not dream of staying anywhere else on a return trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed my stay here . I came due to a business event and was very pleasant ##ly surprised with the large Corner King Suite I was given and the fantastic location of the hotel near many of the main sights of Chicago . The views are amazing and I thought the food in the Palm Bar was very good . Overall the staff were very friendly and helpful and you can walk from here to Navy Pier , MI ##chi ##gan Avenue , and many other places within a few blocks . Very good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff were exceptional , but our room was not very clean at all . There were co ##b ##we ##bs in the light fixtures , toilet was dirty , there was a dead spider smashed on the ceiling , and the room was very dusty . These never changed the 2 nights that we stayed . The service and food was excellent in the hotel bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here with another couple for a weekend . We stayed in room 2007 which is a junior suite on floor 20 . A high floor is preferred , but I suspect any floor would do well . We utilized Le Bar once and ordered room service once . Both were excellent . The location is very convenient and makes Chicago very walk ##able . The v ##alet parking is $ 71 per night , but there are not any real alternatives to this unless you take a L ##y ##ft from another garage fairly far away . That doesn ' t work very well with a lot of luggage . Overall , expectations exceeded would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very much looking forward to my stay here , but had an ear and sin ##us infection and knew travel wasn ' t ad ##vis ##able . Unfortunately , when I contacted the hotel directly - 2 days in advance - to cancel my appointment , saying I was sick , they denied the cancellation and said I ' d be charged 100 % . They referred me to the " cancellation policy " per my booking which was th ##ru Southwest Airlines . I contacted the airline and they again requested the cancellation on my behalf . They were told the same : I ' d be charged 100 % for being very sick and attempting to give the hotel at least 48 hours notice . S ##hame on the Mill ##len ##nium ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed there for 6 nights for business . I had a really nice experience . St ##uff is really friendly and nice and the room was great . 5 minutes away from the Red Line underground and 3 minutes away from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and shopping area . Easy to walk even to the Loop . Total ##ly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great time in the corner room with a lake ##view on the 19th floor . It was a beautiful view . Room is oddly shaped ( building is in the shape of a triangle ) , putting a hallway between the bathroom and the bedroom area , but nice to have a little extra space / privacy . The bathroom had nice bright lighting , big windows , and good products . The gym is fantastic . Beautiful views , clean , well - kept and variety of equipment . Near the bar , check out the dart ##board and s ##hu ##ffle ##board table ! P ##ric ##ing tips : book on hotel tonight then upgrade your room when you get there . F ##Y ##I there is a $ 25 resort fee collected during your stay , so factor this into your expected final price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located property , yet , serve is lacking for a Conrad . De ##par ##ted my room at 73 ##0 , came back at 203 ##0 and the room was as as I left it 16 ##hr ##s prior . No service , breakfast tray as I left it . Very poor for this class of hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location location location . The rooms , elevators and conference center were excellent . The c ##v ##s across the street is con ##vin ##ient and takes care of all the essential Di ##aly ##sis needs especially bottle ##d water . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not bad but not great - it is a usual convention hotel with thousands of rooms and swimming with people . I prefer smaller , bout ##ique hotels but this stay was pre - arranged by a third party . I was very disappointed at having to wait 25 minutes for the v ##alet to bring me my car when I had called for it 25 minutes prior to showing up at the v ##alet stand . G ##rr ##rr ##rr . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My company just had our annual meeting here . I can ' t say enough about how good the staff , meeting rooms and food were . They did a really good job for us and our teams were very happy . The banquet servers are also a really nice , friendly and at ##ten ##tive group . Great experience at Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great stay at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago during my conference . Check ##ing in and out was a breeze . The Palm is a must . The chef , kitchen , and wait staff are superb ! All of the staff members are very helpful . It was easy to find the meeting rooms . The view from my room was un ##par ##alle ##led ; I had a view of the Navy Pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love She ##rato ##n properties and wanted to stay here for quite some time . I ' ve come away a little let down . Don ' t get me wrong , location is great , property is beautiful and the help was all very polite and friendly . What I can ' t understand is why a property this nice and with prices in the $ 200 / night range feels they have to nickel and dim ##e you to death . $ 25 / day for a refrigerator in your room ? $ 13 . 95 a day for wireless , even though I am a member of SP ##G ? Maybe we ' re just lucky here in Michigan , but I cannot remember the last time I was charged for either of those things and I travel quite frequently for work . S ##hame , because as much as I liked the property , I left with a not to great taste in my mouth . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After a long day of travel because of snow delays , I was pleasant ##ly surprised at the kind and welcoming folks at the front desk ( s ) . When I explained to Nicole T . my he ##ctic day of travel and my chance to use this business trip for R & R from my 19 - month - old , she made my trip a little bit better . She set me up with a room and a view , and a nice big bed to melt into ! ; ) The hotel was modern , well - kept , and central ##ly located . My room was spacious , clean , with a great view . My only grip ##e , be it small , the hair ##dr ##yer was weak . I would have packed my own if I knew that in advance . Otherwise , great service , location , and quality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at the Conrad hotel ! Beautiful de ##cor , nice little " extra touches " in the room , gorgeous view of Michigan Ave , and more . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Service was very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I L ##O ##VE the Ambassador . It ' s my home away from home . The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are super clean . I love the am ##bian ##ce of the hotel , they have an amazing entrance lobby , library room and bar on the first floor . The staff is exceptional - Kay always makes me feel welcome with her big smile and warm personality . Everyone is very at ##ten ##tive with their service . I cannot say enough good things about the staff . I stay in Chicago often and would only stay here . I highly recommend this as your go to for a business or vacation travel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is okay but for the price leaves a lot to be desired . The Bloody Mary drink was wonderful as is the Bar . Breakfast B ##uff ##et was good and p ##lent ##iful choices though expensive ! Need more amenities like free water ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a f ##abulous stay that was made even better by the exceptional service we received from Matt at the front desk . He took what was a minor in ##con ##ven ##ience with maintenance and turned it into a stay we will never forget . He treated us like we truly mattered and that our being happy was his u ##t ##most concern . He even got out a hotel map to work with me . I would definitely stay here again and cannot say enough good things about this hotel or its staff . The location was perfect and within great walking distance to most of the places we wanted to get to . We will be back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l is known for quality properties . This hotel is no exception . It is in a great location on the Chicago River at Navy Pier near the lake . All main attractions are easily accessible . Room ##s are spacious and clean . The service , however , is what triggered this review . The con ##cier ##ge team goes above and beyond in all aspects . Con ##cier ##ge Bernard went all out in assisting my wife with a client wine delivery . Work ##ed tire ##lessly , had good ideas , got the job done , and followed up . All with a wonderful attitude . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel , comfortable mini - suite , many wonderful amenities and te ##rri ##fic location . What really sets this hotel apart is the amazing customer service , from check in to check out . We would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed with my family now several times at Home ##wood Suite ##s in River North . The location is very good - just off Michigan Avenue but very walk ##able to restaurants in River North , Michigan Avenue , and then across the river . Every time the staff have been very helpful , court ##eous , and seem to go above and beyond to make everyone ' s stay cheerful . Great views if you have a high floor room . Breakfast quality and variety is good , but dining room can get very busy in the mornings . Both times I have stayed there I have gotten a very reasonable price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location in the city is the best ! The staff is so friendly and helpful , and the rooms are wonderful . . . clean , great window seats to curl up and relax in , and large . And like all Kim ##pton hotels , this one is so dog - friendly , and it allows us to enjoy long weekends in the city and have our pu ##p with us . The Monaco is our new favorite in town ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Even without a continental breakfast this hotel is worth every penny . The location is supreme , the staff is lovely and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The bar is awesome and the view is price ##less . The parking is not price ##less , however , so do look up a parking app . Their fitness center is nice ; though this property desperately needs a pool or sa ##una / hot tub . We were unable to eat at the restaurant , but it looked amazing . ( Lo ##l , life post ##20 ##20 ) The gift shop was almost too good ; I spent entirely too much money there ! The service was lovely in every event . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were treated like garbage . The desk representative didn ##t tell us where our r ##oon was , what check out time was or even said enjoy your stay . The sales re ##ps for Hilton membership were push ##y and di ##s ##res ##pect ##ful . The room was disgusting , there were blood and hair on the sheets which wasn ##t ours . We were there for a work ch ##rist ##mas party , There were at least over a 100 of my fellow colleagues and we brought a ton of business to your hotel this weekend . This was an absolute di ##s ##gra ##ce . I ' ll never stay at your hotel chain again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This park is ultra modern and part of the big city downtown . It was a fun place to start a walk to the lake and down the river . Good places to eat nearby . Most of the people we saw were either tourists or j ##og ##gers . The B ##IG exception was a field full of yoga practitioners by the outdoor am ##pha ##the ##at ##r . Ser ##ved that same function as Dolores Park in San Francisco . Only negative is the cost of parking is abusive all around that area . We have a car because we are driving out of town later today . If your goal is to be a tourist in Chicago , I su ##gg ##ges ##t public transit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel , but you can definitely stay more central to public transportation and other attractions . It ' s not that far from things you want to see , but it ' s just far enough and feels isolated . That said , it is a very nice hotel , and the staff were lovely . There was an issue with my door that got handled immediately , which was impressive . I got a very good rate through Hotel Tonight , so I really can ' t complain . I probably wouldn ' t s ##p ##lu ##rge on what this normally costs , since I can definitely stay at places that are just as nice and closer to the Loop for less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visit Chicago 4 or 5 time a year to attend performance at Goodman Theatre , and always try to stay at the Monaco . The location is great for walking from Union Station , shopping , the theatre , and Art Institute . The rooms are quite adequate and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at many hotels in Chicago over the years but this by far is my number 1 . Friendly , efficient and professional employees . The room and the property were attractive clean and very comfortable . There was not a thing that was not top notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I recently stayed at The Ambassador Chicago on a Thanksgiving family holiday trip . . . . . . . from the front door welcoming staff to the at ##ten ##tive and pro ##mpt house ##keeping personnel . . . we were treated so g ##rac ##iously . . . lovely staff all the way around I would highly recommend this hotel and have stayed here many times and received consistent superb customer service . . . and our family dog also loved the stay ! [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel with fantastic staff , location and rooms . As a business travel ##er with everything that comes with it its worth tons to find a hotel that gives you the special " home away from home ' - feeling that Public do . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Si ##mp ##ly a low budget ( but high price ) experience . Room reserved was not available and absolutely no service or food is offered in case you want even the minimum of anything . There are plenty of other good choices in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted with the family and overall the hotel was great . They gave kids backpack ##s with toys upon arrival and showed up before bed with care packages for the kids with cookies and milk . The hotel was nice and comfortable and great location . Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had only 3 days - 2 nights in Chicago city center . The Intercontinental Chicago locate ##s right on Michigan Eve . Great location to walk around and shop . Michael Jordan and Star ##bu ##ck just next to hotel . Room is good with 2 big beds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 4 ni ##tes at she ##rato ##n grand ch ##ica ##go the staff was fantastic . everyone was eager to help and always with a smile but one outstanding employee guaranteed me and my granddaughter a super vacation . Fe ##lic ##ia at the front desk helped me with my bill when my bank de ##bit ##ed an over ##cha ##rge she was on the phone not once but twice and got my funds released so we could enjoy our day at am ##eric ##an girl and even though the problem was my fault she still gave me free breakfast and drinks and at no time did she ever act in a hurry or agitated with me . The rooms and pool are nice . Good location . But they also have a Fe ##lic ##ia which will make me return . Thanks so much for a wonderful time [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d that we had two bathroom ##s in our room and the roll away bed was nice and comfortable and room was very spacious . The pub was nice to get a late night snack when we arrived and the snack bar had al ##ot to offer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a package sent here by accident and their staff did all they could to help get it back to me ! Malik ##a and Felix were super helpful ! Doesn ' t hurt that their beds are incredibly comfortable and their drinks at the bar at strong ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bell ##man and hosts / hostess ##es were very welcoming to us at check in and helpful with suggestions throughout our stay . The hotel is just a few short blocks from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Continental breakfast is served daily which is a plus for us . Room ##s are large and the w ##i - fi is fast in case you are traveling for business . The hotel is very close to the L if you don ' t mind public transportation . However , parking is not cheap - $ 62 a day ( this was a holiday weekend , so it may be cheaper on " off days " ) . Fe ##lt very safe walking to and from locations at this hotel . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] queen - queen with river view wonderful view of river and architecture - can enjoy from awesome window seat large room and bathroom central location , close to attractions and subway station staff is persona ##ble , helpful and otherwise awesome ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , very friendly customer service , very clean rooms and perfect indoor temperature . I really enjoyed my stay , so much to see and do around the property . Nice pool , looks like from the r ##oman empire . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super kid friendly ! I would stay there again . Close to many shops and restaurants , com ##fy beds , delicious restaurant in the hotel with a stellar view . The rooms are clean , spacious and the beds are very com ##fy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great hotel and location . Room was a little dusty but was a great place . Both my husband and I slept great and really enjoyed our stay . Friendly staff and great lobby too . We would certainly stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for three nights . Room is clean . Staff is very court ##eous . Hotel location is very convenient within walking distance to dozens of restaurants . Hotel lobby is on 20th floor that offers nice view of the city . It has limited space is the only draw ##back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We used The Fair ##mont for a business conference that was being held at the hotel . The location was fantastic especially while the Taste of Chicago was going on in the Park . The staff was exceptional upon check in and made sure to accommodate any requests we had ( we didn ' t have many ) . The Gold Lounge was excellent and the staff in the lounge was committed to make sure our every need was met . The rooms were modern and well kept . The views to the Lake were fantastic from our room ! I would highly recommend this hotel and will no doubt return for future trips to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in this hotel for a business trip in September 2018 in room 130 ##3 and received 18 bug bites by the second night there . I reported it , it was confirmed by 3rd party that bed bugs were present . I was offered a room change and minimal amount of Hilton Honors points to compensate for my misery . I had to fight the GM in order to get him to com ##p the whole 3 days stay at the hotel and take care of my laundry ( which I have still not received 4 days later ) . Not only did the GM make me feel like I was at fault , but the also pretended as if this was not a hotel issue whatsoever . I would NO ##T recommend this place , I would NO ##T stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is a ma ##rve ##lous throw back to the way travel used to be . The building itself has the q ##ua ##int elevators , the entry way to the hotel is reminiscent of the grand old days of travel . When you are greeted by the door ##man with a wonderful smile and welcome , to the bell ##man who g ##rac ##iously takes your luggage with care , to the front desk staff ' s I ##mp ##ec ##ca ##ble knowledge and perfection and the the con ##cier ##ge ' s un ##par ##alle ##led g ##rac ##ious ##ness . . . you know that you have been taken back to the wonderful era of travel . The ma ##rt ##ini bar which is staffed by the talent of the best in the city . Steven , Her ##iber ##to , Moor ##a , Rafael , and of course Danny make up the best that the city has to offer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my 3rd visit to this historic hotel and every time I learn more about the family namesake hotel . This time I was visited for 4 nights . As usual it was a great stay . He lobby bar just is amazing looking and even more with who you can meet there . The food is also very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was at the Hotel All ##egro for a business conference and everything was beautiful and the staff was amazing . We asked to check ##out a day early and they were a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting by letting us do this and not charge us the extra night we were supposed to be there . Also they split our bill for the hotel so each of the ladies could pay their portion and get their own re ##ceipt ##s . The rooms were spacious and clean . I can ’ t wait to stay at this hotel next fall again for the same conference ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Palmer House has been one of my favorite Chicago Hotels for over 30 years . It is a classic hotel with the old time el ##egan ##ce that makes you feel like you are in an era gone by . The staff is always there to help and friendly . It is a big hotel so if you have a good number of bags , get Bell help to your room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel as it was close to my meeting location . All of the staff were friendly and helpful throughout my stay . The bed was firm ##er than I normally sleep on , but I slept better than expected . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As good as it gets . Walking distance to everything . On site restaurant without that hotel feel . The suite was spacious and worth the cost . Really friendly and non - s ##nob ##by staff , from the bartender to the door ##men . Great for corporate events or leisure . connected to everything through underground passages . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time staying at the O ##m ##ni and I can say it was overall a great choice . I ' ve stayed at other hotels on Michigan Avenue but the location of the O ##m ##ni is the best . Everything we wanted was within blocks . I also really enjoyed the fully stock ##ed fridge . Con ##s : The food from room service was not very food . P ##ull out sofa ##s ate dated request a roll ##away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed there on a business trip to Chicago . Location was really good . It ' s a walking distance to mill ##eno ##um park and many other attractions . The room was spacious , with desk to work . Bed was comfortable and room overall was quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here for just a couples weekend filled with shopping and dining . . . this hotel is extremely nice and is in a phenomena ##l location right off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . You won ’ t be disappointed if you stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an average 4 * hotel at best , not a “ fair ##mont ” . The rooms are old , shower ##s water pressure is extremely low and toilet door won ’ t close fully . Every ##day we had to ask them to service our room , and the only thing they serviced is made the bed ! They haven ’ t added any coffee / tea bags even though we ran out of them . The glasses left dirty too . This hotel ruins the Fair ##mont brand which is sad ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first trip to Chicago ! We stayed at the Ambassador and enjoyed our stay ! Beautiful hotel with a very co ##zy feel . Great breakfast in the hotel and excellent service . There is also a co ##zy bar . Close to shopping and restaurants , the Vale ##t service is also excellent there ! Any request is handled with a smile . I highly recommend The Ambassador ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment we walked in until our late evening check ##out our 2 day stay at Hotel Mon ##oc ##o was spectacular . The front desk clerk Abdul made sure we had everything we needed and was very friendly and welcoming . Our room was im ##ma ##culate ##ly clean and fresh . The hot chocolate Friday night and the wine happy hour with a socially distance ##d plan . The view from our room was world class and for a stay ##cation was a very welcome view . I couldn ' t more highly recommend staying at Hotel Monaco for a Stay ##cation or V ##aca ##tion when visiting Chicago . So grateful for such a great weekend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a fantastic hotel in every sense of the word . The bar is also phenomena ##l , Great bartender ##s , in particular Clay . Service was un ##believable , beautiful beautiful well appointed hotel . The automatic blind ##s are a very nice touch . I stayed at the R ##itz Carlton for 3 nights of my stay and the Conrad the last night . So so upset I didn ' t stay at the Conrad the entire time . There is no other hotel I will ever stay at in Chicago on future trips , cannot say enough good things . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I ah e stayed at The Talbot ##t multiple times during our trips to Chicago . The rooms are nicely re ##mo ##del ##ed , as is the front entry . Staff is nice and very helpful . The hotel is convenient ##ly located near Michigan Ave and State Street , the heart of so much to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I plan on going back there for the weekends for sure . The location is amazing , and while I did not use all amenities I was happy with the room and service . I did not spend a lot of time at the hotel as I was out and about shopping ( I live in Michigan and we don ' t have any of these shops ) . But a thumbs up overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked bed & breakfast at this hotel and wasn ’ t disappointed . The staff are very at ##ten ##tive and helpful . The rooms are perfect and the bed was so comfortable . The bathroom had everything you could need including great lighting . This lovely hotel served a delicious breakfast every morning . It is perfectly located to explore the city and had lots of lovely restaurants in the area . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel provided a fantastic experience . The entire staff ( reception , con ##cier ##ge , baggage assistance , restaurant / bar and cleaning staff ) was extremely welcoming and professional . The hotel ' s location was ideal for walking out to restaurants and exploring Chicago . As someone who travels the world for business , I cannot stay enough good things about the Talbot ##t . This is a unique experience for the U . S . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We travelled to downtown Chicago for a Cubs game and stayed at the Conrad . From room quality to service to rooftop bar , this place is a great downtown hotel . We travelled with our 2 boys ( 14 and 10 ) . Even the welcome from the v ##alet and staff in the lower level was very welcoming . The room size for 2 queen ##s was great for the 4 of us . Must go to the rooftop bar and get a spike ##d snow ##ball . We didn ’ t utilize the con ##cier ##ge , so I can ’ t comment there . Great experience and I ’ d stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel to stay in . Room was very nice . As the staff upon arrival . Did not have one problem during my stay . The area was very good to . It ' s in a great spot to explore and had many options to chose from . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is quite L ##O ##VE ##L ##Y ! Great location , very nice rooms and great customer service ! Close to everything in the downtown area which makes it easy to walk to some of the more popular spots in the loop area . Nice bar and restaurants inside the hotel too . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first stay at the Conrad in Chicago and I couldn ' t be more pleased with the experience . My room was very luxurious and high tech . The lights , shades and black ##out curtains were all controlled with the push of a button , as was the room privacy indicator . The room was beautiful with its high end floors , counters and walk - in shower . It also had L ##OT ##S of closet space for my clothes and other ne ##cess ##ities and was furnished with a bath ##robe , slip ##pers and an umbrella . I can ' t say enough how much I enjoyed my stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a few days over the summer . The hotel was great ! Our room was very spacious and had a nice view that was great for people watching . The front desk workers , as well as the v ##alet , were very nice and helpful . They even stored our luggage when we had to check out , but didn ' t need to leave as our flight was later . There was always flavor ##ed water available in the lobby . Our room had a mini fridge and a couch . The bed was com ##fy . We did eat the breakfast every morning , and I remember the last morning we were there it was really busy and crowded . Compared to all of the other awesome things about this place , that was really minor . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Business meets pleasure ! I was in Chicago for a business holiday party . The hotel is situated right between the shopping and cultural district so it ' s very convenient to access both . The hotel also has a great space for the social ##izing . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the hotel to the staff this place is top notch . We ended up having a family emergency during our trip and they did everything they could above and beyond our expectations to help in any way we needed them too . We will be staying again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff is a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tive and friendly . En ##ti ##re hotel is well maintained and spot ##less . We traveled with our three young children . P ##lent ##y of restaurants and shopping within walking distance . Would definitely recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was great , well organized , pretty atmosphere , friendly staff , G ##RE ##AT B ##ED ! ! ! ! I did upgrade to higher floor for $ 20 per night , which was a great choice , although it only had partial view of Michigan lake . We wanted to steal their bed , it was too comfortable it released all the tired ##ness from the traveling ! ! ! L ##O ##VE ##D IT [SEP]
1	[CLS] Palmer house lobby is quite impressive . Room had a huge king sized bed in an acceptable room , but by no means spacious . Most things were well maintained . . . but my cold water f ##au ##ce ##t on my bathroom sink was broken . Good news is that they came up and immediately fixed it . They did offer me early check in which was greatly appreciated . Bed had an odd bump in the middle which made it a bit uncomfortable . The offered me a coffee maker which was nice , but it ' s lid was missing and covered with a piece of plastic wrap . A bit ta ##cky for a high end hotel , but it worked and was still nice . No view at all as I was facing another side of the building [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was perfect for our family of 4 . the staff was so helpful in guiding us around the city . The food offered great variety and healthy options ! We appreciated the environmental kind ##ess . Social hour was a great treat , something for everyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed here for a conference and was very impressed by the staff and room . The room was very comfortable , with lots of space and great views . The staff was even better : very helpful to a first time visitor to Chicago . The location was perfect for a first time ##r in Chicago . It ' s central location allowed s ##tro ##lls along the Chicago river over to the Navy Pier or down to Millennium Park and the Art Institute . After such an excellent stay , I am planning on returning with the family to explore more of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are decorated in a modern perspective . The rooms are small especially the bathroom . The bathroom is very tight and cramped . You could not have two people in the bathroom at a time trying to get ready . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , friendly staff , rooms need updates . Matt ##ress needed to be replaced and no plug ##s near bed . Lo ##bby is trend ##y and great location to great restaurants and Michigan Ave shopping . If I book again I would request an updated room with new mattress . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I usually don ' t write reviews , but sometimes you feel compelled to do so . I would like to share our experience with Ms . Kate Mart ##sul , R ##ov ##ing Room ##s Manager at Hay ##at Regency of Chicago . She was very court ##eous and caring . She went out of her way to help us out and make our stay super comfortable . I just wanted to appreciate her efforts . I believe people like her , are the ones who make real positive difference in other ' s life . Ms . Mart ##sul , please keep up the great work . Your help is highly appreciated . Na ##si ##m and Nah ##eed A ##kh ##tar [SEP]
1	[CLS] The manager was rude at check out . I never make reviews but think he needs to be addressed . If he would have treated us differently this review would be far better . . . when my husband went to tell him about the few issues we had he was very dismiss ##ive and acted like he didn ’ t care at all . A simple apology would have went a long way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here while attending a conference . Great location , good customer service , but a final cost of just over $ 700 for 3 nights after taxes and fees . The rooms were nice and clean , but the hotel is huge and difficult to get your bearings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A beautiful , Chicago Landmark structure that is a hotel , the staff is extremely helpful both during room upgrades ( if you are a hotel member ) and at the help desk for guests , there are two wonderful restaurants on premises as well as an always very busy Star ##bu ##cks . The views are spectacular from the rooms and decent sized depending on the stays . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a quick overnight for me and the kids for an appointment we had . We were offered an upgrade to our room ( for a small fee ) which we accepted and the kids L ##O ##VE ##D their stay in the luxurious suite . Upon check in the staff was very polite ( and kind to my kids who were ants ##y after sitting in the car for over 3 hours ) . They were looking for something to give to the kids ( not sure what ? ) but didn ' t find it and instead offered to send up cookies and milk for the evening . That was a thoughtful gesture that went a long way with my kids . When I had to call the service desk with a couple questions , they were pro ##mpt and professional . Really , it was smooth and comfortable and clean and best of all . . the staff were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t has the best staff I ’ ve encountered anywhere ! D ##wayne , Charles , con ##cier ##ge , front desk , house ##keeping , and manager are so helpful , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and they genuinely want to make your stay as comfortable as possible . This visit was a girls weekend . Our stay was f ##abulous as usual and I keep returning to this hotel due to the welcoming caring staff , plus excellent location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service , clean ##liness , location and staff all excellent . However there is no flexibility regarding breakfast menu . I was not allowed order smoked salmon with p ##oa ##ched egg as it was not listed as a dish on the menu even though the ingredients were available . Smoke ##d salmon could only be served with bag ##el and cream cheese . I write this review from the Mar ##riot ##t Water ##front Baltimore where full flexibility applies regarding menu combinations . Not rocket science . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been in the o ##m ##ni in 3 occasions in the last 2 months . The first time I ’ ve got a nice room with a separated seating room and it was very nice . On the last 2 occasions I got a room that didn ’ t have a separated seating area and it was still nice but the position of the t ##v made it impossible to watch it from bed or even from the couch , and the wardrobe was in the bathroom . The location is perfect , and the staff is very friendly [SEP]
1	[CLS] We paid additional money for a king bed room , and were not happy . There were no drawers at all to put clothing , had to live out of the suitcase . I asked for a discount on the room , and there was no cooperation . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our family was lo ##dging at Home ##wood Suite ##s Chicago Grand Ave last weekend and found this facility a great find . For the price of the stay , we found the breakfast ##s provided to be over our expectations . Jeremy , the breakfast port ##er made our stay very pleasant and treated us like family . The location on Grand Avenue was great as it was central ##ly located to the shopping on Michigan Ave as well as convenient access to the Chicago mass transit system . One thing we value is the way the staff treats their guests . Con ##cier ##ge Sammy was particularly friendly and helpful for what we needed . An added per ##k to this facility was the small kitchen facilities that we used to make sure our grandchildren had their snack ##s and eats . If I could give this a 6 - star rating , I definitely would . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel itself is very nice . It ' s clean , the rooms are pretty big and modern . But they recently started adding a $ 16 . 00 " resort fee " for rooms booked through the Hotel Tonight app ( which I highly recommend ) . The fee is hidden in the small print on the app and not mentioned at all when you check in . It ' s only after I looked at my credit card that I noticed it . When I asked the hotel , they claimed it was an " incident ##al " . Sorry , but I consider incident ##als to be $ 12 bottles of water or bags of pre ##tz ##els . Not resort fees . Just seems pretty s ##hady that they ' re not more up ##front about it . Especially when they ' re the only hotel in my 3 + years of using the app who ' ve charged extra . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suites are very nice , a kitchen ##ette cum living room with an office desk and chair was very nice . The bedroom was small but as there was a living room this was not an issue . The hotel is nice , the lobby area is one level above street level where a port ##er helps bring your luggage to reception via an elevator . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Diego , Will , Marsh ##a and numerous others made our trip wonderful . Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and understanding to our needs . Facility is updated and modern yet historic . G ##ym and pool are one of a kind . Bar is happening and food is good . Star ##bu ##cks in lobby . A + [SEP]
1	[CLS] the Hotel is great , the problem is the v ##alet they never get you car in time , find other solutions , it cost 70 $ and never works We had food with our company and it was not good , but the Palm restaurant is good [SEP]
1	[CLS] Top location at the city , an typical USA big city hotel a lot of tradition long corridors nice rooms and somewhat un ##mot ##ivated staff , but I can recommend everyone for a weekend trip . Location , location and location ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Reservation for King room via Book ##ing . com but got Queen room ! They said no guarantee for booking via 3rd party . Poor internet . Not fill up the s ##ham ##po ##o and condition ##er during our stay 4 nights . . . . . T - T [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is quite charming , yet feels dated . Maybe it was hearing rumours about the place being haunted before checking in that did it for me but I feel the place has a slightly er ##rie v ##ibe . The room was spot ##less and the bathroom was ideal . Re ##ception staff were friendly and helpful . There ' s a little bar at the foyer which is nice , and the location is so central . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for a weekend with some friends . The location was appealing as it was close to downtown and a lot of the bars and restaurants . The hotel itself was decent , by no means extraordinary but not bad . You can tell it ’ s a little older but the beds are comfortable and rooms su ##ff ##ice for what you pay ( F ##OR THE R ##O ##OM ) . The reason it ’ s a 3 star for me instead of 4 star is the idiot ##ic price for parking . $ 67 a night to park is a complete joke . I realize it ’ s the city and all but it ’ s mind blowing to pay that much to park . I probably won ’ t be back for that reason alone . [SEP]
0	[CLS] For a hotel of this category they could maintain it better . The staff had little smile on their faces when they served . Welcome was less than me ##dio ##cre . At the rest ##ua ##rant again the staff had no smile while serving except ##ing on the last day before we vacated the chef had some friendly conversation . H ##ya ##tt you can definitely do better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff , especially Matt and Spencer , were so helpful . The whole experience was wonderful ! I stayed 5 nights this week so was able to try several restaurants which were an easy walk . S ##nac ##ks at happy hour were a plus . My traveling companion had a nut all ##er ##gy but Matt always found her a non ##pe ##anu ##t treat . Breakfast was nice but past ##ries seemed dry . I loved the g ##rano ##la and yo ##gu ##rt . I hope to return soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay here frequently for business . A ##rri ##ved at the hotel quite late at night . Was greeted warmly at check in by Leah . Re ##co ##gni ##zing I was dead on my feet , she managed to locate late night ca ##ffe ##ine for me and I was in my room within minutes . G ##rab ##bed my compliment ##ary coffee while checking out the next morning and was on my way to meetings . Love ##ly property , friendly staff . Easy stay . They also have a great restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . House ##keeping staff was great . The windows of my " water view " room were the filthy . I ' ve never seen worse . The wall ##paper was p ##eel ##ing . The furniture was chip ##ped . The p ##lum ##bing fixtures - cheap . Hotel dining options were of me ##dio ##cre quality and over - priced . On site parking is crazy at $ 60 + / day ( I found better options at $ 15 / day just a few blocks north ) . This hotel is about 20 years over do for a re ##mo ##del . Next time I ' ll stay at the Fairfield Inn just a few blocks north . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our room was very nice . It would have been nice ##r if we were higher up to get a city view . We were given a bottle of champagne and a dessert to recognize our wedding anniversary . My only negative comment was the pillows were way too soft . Need ##ed 3 to prop our heads up . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My fi ##an ##cé and I were staying at the Conrad Chicago for a work - related conference . The service was always exceptional , but one evening , my fi ##ance ##e was feeling under the weather . the water provided for the room had run out , and so I went to the desk to request more . I told the person at the desk that my Fi ##ance ##e was not feeling well today . A few moments later someone arrived at our door with several more bottles of water , and then another knock came and Becky was presented with a pot of clear tea and a card from the front desk hoping that she would get well soon . It was simply one of the best customer service moments I have every experienced with a hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My young son and I stayed here recently and it was wonderful ! As soon as we arrived , we were met with a smile outside ( and it was a little chill ##y to be smiling ! ! ) . We had wonderful help with our bags and directions . It was truly a great place to stay and very short walking distance to bus stops , the subway , and they never hesitated to help get a cab ! The refrigerator was stock ##ed with lots of drinks and they had a lot of snack ##s to choose from in the room , keep in mind the costs of these items ! It was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie hotel is very central ##ly located that you can walk to almost all attractions ( if you don ' t mind walking several blocks ) . It is one block from the river and 2 blocks from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It is close to the free trolley when it is running and metro stations . The room was clean and spacious . We really enjoyed the free evening reception with beer or wine and mixed nuts and pre ##tz ##el mixes . The free continental breakfast was also very good with plenty of choices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice small hotel near Millennium Mile . Very convenient , friendly staff , adequate food and beverage for in hotel service . . . ( there is such a variety within easy walking distance anyway ) . The in room computer comes on each day at 8 : 00 AM , which can be annoying if you want to sleep in , but is easily put back to sleep [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first time staying at a So ##fit ##el . The service was beyond exceptional , the food was excellent and the room was spacious and very clean . Room service was quick and fresh c ##rois ##san ##ts every day were so good [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff how were happy to help us with any problems especially the door staff . Love ##ly hotel with good size rooms . Clean and t ##idy hotel . Also the hotel isn ’ t too fair from the shopping mall so has plenty of thing to do close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful stay and location . The only negative ##s were trivial . Only one bath ##robe , no slip ##pers , ice machines not working , one electric socket did not work . Bed ##ding was nice and layout of suite was nice . Re ##ception service was very nice and I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great customer service - all the staff seemed very happy to accommodate our situation . i g ##ena ##er ##lla ##y don ##t write review but i have decided that if it were to help someone that is looking for a place in the city maybe this will help : ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had an amazing , bonding experience for a little get - away to Chicago . My daughter had her first " big city " experience . Even in CO ##VI ##D , we felt very safe / clean / socially distance ##d . The staff were helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , even though some of their services were limited . Dar ##ni ##ta at the Hilton and Ingrid at the AG store went over and beyond to make our experience magical . My daughter and her friend were b ##ub ##bling with anticipation and excitement at the American Girl Store . The experience was magical . We did personal shopping , salon , nail and lunch activities . The staff members created a warm environment and the girls felt highly p ##amp ##ered . I would highly recommend the Hilton Chicago and The American Girl store in your next get - away ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , located well . Know that the junior suites are near elevators , and the studio suites are over the back which has bee ##ping trucks in the pre - dawn hours . Apart from that , the hotel is clean and handsome , and has character . The rooms are quiet if you get the right location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have probably stayed at over 200 hotels — this is one of the worst . The hotel is a major need to a re ##mo ##del . They have a r ##oa ##ch problem . The staff is rude , stupid , and lies to your face . When I tried to complain to the general manager never received a call back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for two nights for a family wedding . It ' s a great location and convenient to get around , rooms were a good size for a city hotel , and service was at ##ten ##tive . One of the elevators was broken for the entire weekend we were there and with the hotel being packed it was a bit of a mess , but staff were a ##pol ##og ##etic about it and luck ##ily one staff member assisted us with getting down from the 11th floor with all of our luggage during a crazy morning check ##out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel in a good location of Chicago . My studio was very spacious . Service was overall good , although at initial check in i was not given the compliment ##ary drink ticket for the restaurant . Additionally i had to follow up about breakfast as this was also included in my room rate but not mentioned to me at the time of check in . Minor issues that would not keep me from coming back to this property . Only real issue to note was the street noise from my second level room . Luckily I brought ear plug ##s which helped greatly , but really can ##t imagine anyone staying on the second floor adjacent to the alley and not having this complaint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my favorite place to stay in Chicago . the staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are large . The location is perfect . I had a beautiful room with a walk in shower . The bar is lively at night and the service is great . Had br ##unch at the hotel and the prices were good for a Chicago hotel . Will be returning ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great stay , had fun at the hotel . The employees went above and beyond to ensure that we were comfortable and taken care of . I would stay there again in a heartbeat if I was asked where we should stay for a future trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a wedding . The ballroom was gorgeous and the location is great . We enjoyed the staff , but the breakfast was less than impressive . There is also quite a bit of street noise on the E Walton side . The standard King room is pretty tiny . Ser ##ved our purpose , but didn ’ t w ##ow us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great service , nice rooms . Food was good although not an extensive menu . Only down ##side was noise from ambulance ##s nearby . W ##if ##i is not free . Just two blocks away from bus stops ( Chicago big bus that takes you through the loop ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We joined another couple in Chicago in February 2019 to see the North American Auto Show . We had the most amazing stay . The hotel staff were NE ##XT L ##E ##VE ##L in their customer service . B ##rig ##itte at the front desk was the best . She got is checked in ( early ) with great rooms , located by our friends also staying at the hotel . We had some plans to see family in town and B ##rig ##itte helped us with special a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s to make our stay more pleasant with us a young baby and dog . We had everything we needed in the room . Happy hour was great ! Location is perfect . Clean , lots of places to sit and have a drink . Bar tender ##s were very friendly and a lot of fun . High quality all around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a lovely long weekend at the hotel - great location , at ##ten ##tive staff , comfortable rooms . Unfortunately , rooms need work ( as an example - blind ##s did not work and needed replacing ) . We booked the Mill ##eni ##um Suite - large , comfortable , but not worth the night ##ly rate . ( Gene ##ric ) Coffee pod ##s not replaced upon use , no night ##ly turn ##down , etc - overall , did not feel any special attention . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni holds itself out to be a Pre ##mium Hotel close to the Miracle Mile . In truth its future is ‘ behind it ’ and if it was a sports team it would have been relegated to lower division . It is tired and further ##more in need of a desperate clean . The clue is in the o ##do ##ur that greet ##s when you enter the property ! ! I have always suspected how ratings systems are manipulated by businesses and this is proof positive ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are here to celebrate Mother ’ s Day and Cubs . 5 room , 10 people so logistics and timing is everything . Room ##s are wonderful . However , no coffee in the room and $ 2 to get it in the lobby . Continental breakfast included with Gold - which we are or higher with a couple rooms , or $ 8 extra for full b ##uff ##et . W ##af ##fle ##s ? To ##aster wa ##ffles ! Yes , it is a state ##ly old hotel . We ’ ve been coming for 40 years , however there are a lot of options with better service and cheaper rates . Come for the history - stay some ##place else for the value [SEP]
1	[CLS] Reason ##able rates for this city , at least for the conference that I was attending . Great lake views if you can get a room on that side . Professional staff , convenient check - in , everything as it should be . The location is excellent with plenty of opportunities for beautiful walks . In the heart of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here two nights on a trip to Chicago . Room was small ##ish but comfortable . Bed was very comfortable . Walls were a little thinner than I ' d like . . . could hear the neighbors chat . But it ' s hard to beat the location and the historic charm . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the best experience here . The staff was amazing and was always on top of any requests I may have had . They offer a discount on the restaurant if you choose to for ##go room cleaning so I ate there a few nights and it was great ! They shipped off items for me that I didn ' t have time to send while I was there and made me feel very welcome ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From here you can get to anything in the loop easily on foot . And , if you want to venture outside of the loop , L stations are nearby . The hotel itself is beautiful . Our room was a bit co ##zy , but that ' s to be expected in a downtown hotel . That said , there was ample room for a real chair , but instead there were two has ##so ##cks - - and a yoga mat . All of which I ' d glad ##ly trade for a chair . That , and the i ##rri ##tating charge for w ##if ##i ( go to the attached Star ##bu ##cks for free w ##if ##i ) were the only negative ##s . Additional plus ##es include night ##ly wine hours and free bikes , and with the parks so close that is a real bonus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently accompanied my husband to his business meeting at The Fair ##mont . We stayed for 3 nights . Everything was perfect . The con ##cier ##ge was helpful getting us in for breakfast at a very busy restaurant nearby . The spa staff was super friendly and professional and took care of making sure I was happy with my services . But the employee who went above and beyond was Man ##dal ##a , a hostess in the Gold Lounge . She was the e ##pit ##ome of customer service . Friendly , professional , helpful and eager to be at your service . We chat ##ted every morning and afternoon and she even gave me shopping tips for Michigan Ave . I felt like I had a friend in the Wind ##y City . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House was once a grand hotel - the lobby area still is ! The rooms , however , are showing their age and are in serious need of renovation . Co ##mb ##ine this with the world ' s smallest bathroom ##s and you get an average hotel stay . Location is the primary value here - it is very near the Art Institute , the Theater District and Millennium Park . A big loss for Hilton Diamond members - the Executive Lounge is now closed . The front desk staff said it is temporary , though management is considering closing it permanently . Seems to be the trend with Hilton ##s across the U . S . [SEP]
1	[CLS] hats off to the best con ##cier ##ge ! T ##iara was amazing — was pro ##active , com ##mu ##nica ##tive , organized and incredibly friendly . She made special arrangements to celebrate my mom ##s milestone birthday . She was beyond at ##ten ##tive : she went above and beyond in delivering special touches and ensuring that my mom felt p ##amp ##ered her entire stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed at the Palmer House before . I have to say , whoever is in charge has stepped up the experience . The hotel employees were pleasant and willing to help in any way to make our weekend better . We stayed in a " small ##ish " room with a king size bed , no view . The bed was perfect for a good nights sleep . The TV in the room is bigger than the one I own ! ! The room was super C ##LE ##AN , bathroom was C ##LE ##AN . The Palmer House bar is legendary . Gorge ##ous environment , beautiful ceiling and perfect place to people watch . Our drinks were made by a master ! Love the Palmer House , we ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gorge ##ous lobby , cool rooms , thoughtful and g ##rac ##ious staff , and a t ##rem ##rn ##do ##us location ! They surprised us with anniversary champagne and mac ##aroo ##ns , and when a leak forced us to change rooms , the staff and engineer found a beautiful suite . We couldn ' t have been happier with this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Being local , not familiar with the property & not a chain I was very skeptical . It was im ##ma ##culate , safe & I was treated like family . I ' ve been @ 5 Star around the world , my new home away from home ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located central ##ly on Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile with great access to shops and transport system . Hotel very clean , staff friendly and helpful and went out of their way to provide us with a microwave so that my wife could heat up milk very early in the morning for her p ##or ##ridge prior to the Chicago marathon , at no additional charge . Breakfast ##s in the 67 ##6 restaurant are divine and their French To ##ast is amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was way larger than the one we booked with H ##ya ##tt points . New ##ly renovated with great de ##cor , super comfortable bed , and oversized flat panel t ##v . The bath products were all large pumps but of very high quality - Jonathan Adler products that smelled great . Only complaint would be the slow elevators . Will definitely stay there again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed here several times on trips to Chicago . The location is great , and the value is very good . I ’ ll definitely stay there again . The bar and steak restaurant and Star ##bu ##cks make easy and delicious meals so convenient , too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was phenomena ##l . It was in a perfect location , the rooms were so big and room ##y . Very clean and very good staff . The food was awesome and I will definitely stay here again . Our check in was fast and easy . The evening compliment ##ary food was great and the breakfast food was awesome . The lobby / dining area is very nice . Staff is very helpful and friendly . The staff assisting was local transportation was so good . They were right there taking care of getting your transportation . The best part of this hotel is the room / suite . It is very large and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . It was like home away from home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , central ##ly located . Fantastic , friendly staff and super comfortable room . High ##ly recommend for both business and personal travel . Bed was AM ##A ##Z ##ING , as were the shower and toilet ##ries provided . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I live in Chicago and have frequented many hotels for conferences and short stays . This is a very state ##ly and grand hotel . It ' s location near the Lake , museums , and other " crown jewels " of Chicago is perfect . I came with just my husband but I think this hotel would be really perfect for families . It ' s near lots of things the kids will love . . . and adults too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Hotel - Art Dec ##o inspired design - Clean and comfortable rooms and public spaces - near everything - Theater ##s , Restaurant ##s , The River ##walk , The Loop , Lake Michigan , Millennium Park - River Tours and great architecture . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was only there for a couple of days , but they staff was great . Easy check in , and out . Wonderful v ##alet service . The bed was comfortable and room was spacious . The location was great for walking to local attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able 2 night stay . Nice am ##bian ##ce , very quiet , friendly staff , spot ##less , no restaurant odor ##s . Perfect location for business . All K ##IM ##P ##TO ##N hotels are good , but this one is better due to room ##y accommodation ##s . Re ##com ##men ##ded ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed there with a friend . First no rooms with two separate beds were available even though I requested it right after booking . Got an upgrade to a one bedroom suite which was fine ( dusty in the corners but mainly clean ) . Room behind the elevators . Sleep possible between 2 ##am and 6 ##am . Executive lounge mostly hopeless ##ly crowded and very basic food . Pro very central and pro pro the staff was really really helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed on 36th floor river view . Really a nice place and within walking distance to most everything . Pay attention to how the elevators work . It ’ s really different . River walk is across the street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel that is convenient to major attractions and an easy walk to most . The hotel was clean with lovely amenities in the room . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast and happy hour made our stay delight ##ful and comfortable . Staff was helpful and at ##ten ##tive ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] i have stayed here 5 times now . I love the rooms as they are very practical and cater really well for the business travel ##er . As a Hilton Diamond , i usually get upgraded and get a $ 30 credit per day to apply to restaurant . The pro ##s are : great location just off the Mile , love the automated black ##out shut ##ters , close to numerous good restaurants , restaurant on property food is good , close to a Star ##bu ##cks , Trade ##r Joe ##s , mall is close if you forget something , nice rooms , walk - in shower ##s instead of bath ##tub ##s , friendly employees , huge TV ##s . The con ##s : can be very price ##y during some weeks , the chair at the work table is awful and hard to move , not a fan of the 20th floor lobby . Overall highly recommend this place . Will be staying again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family group of 16 ( 10 adults and 6 kids , ages 3 - 9 ) had a wonderful experience at The Talbot ##t . Every staff member we encountered was very friendly , helpful , cheerful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting from check - in to check - out . Our experience could not have been better from rooms , drinks , dining , con ##cier ##ge and door ##man helpful advice for exploring Chicago , and hotel location was great . We actually felt sad when leaving our " Talbot ##t friends " . . . but we will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our company stays here for our big annual meeting whenever it ' s in Chicago . Okay . . . that ' s not going to change . First , the rooms are clean , room ##y enough , and comfortable . The lobby and the meeting spaces are nice and attractive . * The lobby bar is my favorite part of this hotel : excellent list of sing ma ##lts , other whiskey ##s , etc ! * That said , the overall service here from front desk staff , restaurant servers , etc . is average to below average . Some staff are excellent ( door ##person ##s , bell ##person ##s , bartender ##s ) , but the culture here seems to have a touch of " I ' m doing you a favor by helping you " instead of the other way around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So de ##ceiving as the lobby , restaurant and bar are all so fly you pre ##sume the room and customer service will match the flow . T ##ruly was an epic let down , and I feel bad as this was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my love . The room was severely dated with a leaking r ##adia ##tor , p ##eel ##ing paint along the base ##boards , deeply stained carpet , r ##ust ##ed tub , p ##eel ##ing walls , dirty and poorly lit hallway ##s . Management made f ##utile attempts to app ##ease the situation , I was heart ##broken on Christmas to have such a bad room . I stayed up all night as I was uncomfortable because of the state of the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a nice visit overall . The con ##cier ##ge had us confused on how to get to the hotel which was f ##rust ##rating . A couple of wonderful things : the bell ##hop directed me to the cycle path so that I can get in an early morning run without car traffic & the bar tender got me some p ##eanut butter which I needed before the marathon . The hotel is nice and has a bout ##ique feel to it . Our room was clean and the hotel staff were very friendly . It was a good distance to the start / finish line of the race , but I really like this area of town . I would definitely come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One day stay and had missing personal items that was reported . I received no assistance from supervisor ##s at lost and found . Finally spoke to one who took my contact information and as of date , no return calls as promised [SEP]
1	[CLS] When the weather is cold avoid this room . It was cold and awful even when the the ##rm ##ost ##at was at 90 and blowing warm air . The food was solid and the pool te ##mp ##ature was fine but they could have had the air temperature warmer as all the kids below 6 seemed to be running around with purple lips . [SEP]
1	[CLS] May not be the best hotel but it is nice , clean , close to Michigan Ave . lots of restaurants and shopping right next door in every direction . when you enter go to the 6th floor for check in . little confusing at first but staff is very helpful in directing you . Breakfast included was average quality food , Breakfast staff very helpful . apples / banana ##s / orange ##s eggs , sa ##usage cereal ##s and bread ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a great long weekend at this Conrad . Service from start to finish was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . Up ##graded to a Michigan view room , and given daily credit for use in the restaurant as a diamond member ( can be used for breakfast or dinner / drinks ) . Our stay was unexpectedly extended due to weather at oh ##are , so we returned and were given another warm welcome . Will certainly be back next time we ’ re in the Chicago area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had co ##urier ##ed a few small packages to the hotel prior to my arrival , the cost to pick them up was $ 29 USD . On departure , I needed to store my small luggage for about 2 hours , the cost was $ 3 USD . Most bout ##ique hotels I frequent do not charge for these mi ##s ##cell ##aneous services . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I look for specific characteristics when choosing a hotel . Location ; friendly / helpful staff ; nice rooms and nice price . Ki ##nz ##ie meet all my requirements . The location was pre ##fect , everything within walking distance . The staff was wonderful ( 5 - star service ) . The room was standard . Not a great view , but didn ' t de ##ter my experience . The price was fair . Please note parking is not cheap ( $ 54 - self parking - a day ) . Need to budget for that next time . I would most definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I took a surprise vacation and my stay was booked at this hotel . And I was not disappointed . Location was easy walking to lots of attractions . Staff was friendly . Hotel is beautiful . The bed was so ##oo comfortable . Love ##d the d ##é ##cor . Good v ##ibe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Its all about the location for the shopping b ##uff - right off North Michigan Ave . Also convenient for the business travel ##ler with convenience shops and restaurants all nearby . The hotel itself is very nice and seems to be an historic building maintained very well . Staff were kind and check in and check out a breeze . Other than a small hi ##cc ##up with the f ##olio settlement , all was good . The room I got was particularly small , but one should not expect Asia type of grand ##eur when it comes to hotel rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this for a last minute trip . The hotel was in a good location , close to a lot of food options and the Michigan Ave . The room was nice and clean place . The only negative was our room was not ready until after 4 ##pm . When we checked in around 3 they said we could get a room immediately for a upgrade fee , we did not do , but I feel like that may have been something they do to everyone and our room may have been ready . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Near by center of down town . There are good steak restaurant and Bar . Beautiful indoor pool and good athletic room are also available . Staff ##s are very kind , and have good skill for our nice stay . Good pizza house " UN ##O " is near this Hotel , 5 ##min on foot [SEP]
1	[CLS] SH ##ow ##er had mold everywhere . . Hair stuck on the ceilings ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly not worth the money ! But staff was great ! Building is showing its age . Bath ##s need a lot of T ##LC , to meet a 4 star standard . Next time in Chicago downtown I will go back to the James ! ! Stay ##ed there the time before and they are on point ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay at the ta ##l ##bot ##t Hotel . We loved it ! The hotel was beautiful and everyone was so nice . The location is awesome , close to Rush street were there is wonderful dining and choose to Michigan avenue were you can ship till you drop ! I highly recommend it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker while in Chicago to see Paul McCartney . The room was clean and the bed was com ##fy . It was not too expensive and pretty convenient ##ly located . I would certainly consider staying here again foe future visits . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would say that the Park ##ing is over ##p ##rice ##d $ 67 / night . Having to find another parking lot is disappointing , nonetheless The hotel room was decent and spacious . The employees were really great and made us feel welcomed [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s a very basic hotel , nice bar . All good , nothing spectacular . The room is ok and practical . I can walk to several restaurants or all the way to Port ##illo ' s , which is not c ##ls ##e , but I love to walk . We enjoyed some drinks in the bar and it was all go ##o . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was polite but it is a hotel designed for men not for women . There was no make - up mirror , the lighting was dreadful , no flexible shower head in the shower , no shower head in the bath and as they give you only one soap you have to carry soap from the sink to the bath . Also while the check out is at 12 . 00 you cannot use the gym facility before ( entry card stopped being valid ) . Considering the price of the room I also believe that you should not have to pay to access the pool . BT ##W being an a ##cco ##r customer does not seem to matter , all the benefits seem to be for Fair ##mont club members . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about my stay was excellent with one exception . An in - room advertisement offered free drinks to guests who refused cleaning service . Hotel staff deserve better than this . Do ##ub ##t I ’ ll return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We held a conference here , the service was wonderful , from dining experience to accommodation , the service exceeded my expectation . I forgot my passport and wallet in the safe after check ##out , the reception desk was able to immediately send someone to pick up with me . One of the best experiences had with hotels . De ##fin ##ite ##ly coming back next time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with wife for 3 day Memorial weekend . Great location . Must get a river view room with window seat . See picture . We ##l ##coming staff enjoyed lobby coffee and wine service . Hotel restaurant good for outdoor breakfast [SEP]
1	[CLS] Eric welcomed us and was professional and friendly . . great and even more of a welcome to celebrate my husbands birthday Up ##grade we were offered was wonderful . . highly recommended the hotel and I ’ ve stayed in many of them in Chicago but this is the best [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a long weekend my family and would recommend this hotel based on the location and overall value . De ##fin ##ite ##ly 4 - 5 star quality experience and what I would expect to pay in a city like Chicago for 3 - 4 star quality . Would stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is a great hotel and worth the room price . It ' s the other fees that will get you . Multiple room taxes , $ 28 for continental breakfast , and $ 70 overnight v ##alet . You ' re right off the Mile and close to multiple great places to eat . Service is very , very at ##ten ##tive and our room was clean , comfortable , and provided a great night ' s sleep . Given the number of great hotels in Chicago , I ' ll probably try a different place next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed the nearby tourist destinations , which were all walking distance . The bed was super comfortable and they even provided a curling iron when I had forgotten mine . The lobby and rooms have beautiful de ##cor , worthy of a photo shoot . There is compliment ##ary coffee and tea every morning . The restaurant next door is attached to the hotel and has great service . I believe there is also happy hour in the hotel bar . Love ##d my stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great bout ##ique hotel in the heart of Downtown Chicago . We had a late night check - in and was initially given a room on the 2nd floor . My husband didn ' t want to be so close to the street so we asked the staff if there were any other rooms available at a higher floor . Since it was a busy weekend , there were no comparative rooms , but they upgraded us to a better room with no extra charge . Staff is friendly and very at ##ten ##tive . They helped us figure out directions to the closest L stops and which train line to take for specific Chicago destinations . Room ##s are clean and modern and b ##oast large windows . I definitely recommend getting a higher floor so that you can enjoy the sky ##line . Numerous local restaurants on the same block and access to the L train is one block away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It seems as though the building was built so that all rooms have excellent views . I was on the 23rd floor and had three large windows in the different directions . The con ##dos nearby obviously know there is a hotel and people generally look out hotel windows , but they make no effort to keep their blind ##s drawn , so you may catch more sites that you bargain ##ed for . The check in process was very simply and staff was very friendly . The location was convenient to every place I wanted to visit and not a terrible walk to the trains . The room itself was quite large and I felt this was more of an apartment than a hotel room . Very clean , would love to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to go to Chicago for our anniversary and didn ' t really want to spend a lot of money . The hotel room was nice , clean , and the people were very friendly . Park ##ing was expensive and we did have some issues with parking but got everything figured out ( hard to find the car on Sunday because the parking garage wasn ' t actually open on Sundays so we had to go to a different entrance ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They except ##ed our request for early check in without com ##pliant - Check Communications - Check They afforded us a room with two beds - Check They allowed for late 5 ##PM check ##out - Check They added Flat She ##ets - Check Food and drinks all good - Check Room TV was large LED - Check R ##O ##OM has W ##IF ##I - Check TV has all digital channels - NO ##P ##E , this is saying something that a quality hotel has not gotten off fuzzy analog . Sure + / - 25 % were digital but the TV system was slow and worse . Sure we don ' t plan to go to a hotel for the TV but when it rains . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for the weekend of the the Chicago marathon , read many reviews both good and bad about the hotel , I found the hotel excellent , staff where friendly and very helpful , it was clean and well maintained , excellent location , with both the magnificent mile and the lake within walking distance [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a nice overnight stay . Nothing wrong just nice . Probably would do 3 . 5 rating . Price is a factor in our rating . Room was nice with a great view of the park . People were great and location was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Were booked in tonight and tomorrow . Was so tired when we arrived we crashed instead of trying to switch rooms . The room is brown and the poor lighting makes for a di ##sma ##l aesthetic . The bed was hard , but has a sunk ##ed middle you slowly g ##ra ##vi ##tate to . There was a previous customers half drunken bottle of water in the closet and there was a must ##y smell . For $ 300 a night and there being plenty of competition , it ' s just not good enough . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for a recent conference . The service , staff and restaurant food were great , however the hotel nickel ##s and dim ##es guests constantly . If you stay here , be prepared to pay a fee for late check out , another fee for luggage storage , another for the fitness center , yet another for high speed internet . . . the list is endless , death by a thousand cuts ! Also , be sure to get a room that is NO ##T located over an alley . . . otherwise you will spend the week in a very dark cave looking directly into the windows of other rooms . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were very pleasant ##ly surprised by how s ##ty ##lish and old fashioned ( in a good way ) the Palmer House seemed when we first walked in . Gen ##uin ##ely welcoming staff ushered us in and directed us to the check in desk and as the full s ##ple ##ndo ##ur of the lobby ceiling rose up before us we were taken a ##back by the grand g ##lamour of the place . Des ##k staff were professional and efficient , our room was well op ##point ##ed and the bed was a generous size and very comfortable . Line ##n , towels and bath ##robe ##s were all fresh and perfectly la ##und ##ered . All in all we had a very pleasant stay and the hotel was how you imagine hotels used to be so we were very pleasant ##ly surprised to find that some still are and at a very fair price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 5 days / 4 nights in the hotel . We were on our honeymoon . No acknowledge ##ment in any form was offered us for our happy occasion . We didn ' t ask for anything extra ahead of time , but we would have appreciated some form of " con ##gratulations to the happy couple " . We had an upgraded room . There was no micro - wave . The refrigerator was c ##ram ##med full of their bar etc . products . To put our things in , we had to remove their items and keep them in a bag to replace when we checked out . The hotel needs a face lift . the check - in desk and lobby area had old wall paper that was coming off and / or quite soil ##ed . Our room was quite comfortable and quiet . Our Bell ##man and Door ##man were super helpful and very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago whenever we are in town . It is class ##y , quiet , clean , central ##ly located and you receive outstanding customer service . Room service is excellent if you need to stay in . The team out on the front mat is always friendly and helpful . Would not stay anywhere else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was beautiful and the staff was extremely helpful ! Very clean and well stock ##ed room with all we needed and more . We used the v ##alet services and would do so again ! The view and location was perfect for all the activities we had planned ! Within walking distance of many of the theaters as well as shopping and Chris ##kind ##l ##M ##ark ##et ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the first steps in to this hotel you can feel friendly atmosphere , smiles on the stuff faces and warmth of interior . Room ##s are with views and newly re ##mo ##del ##ed . Everything A + . Can not wait to go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The corner room kid suites were decorated with fun stuff for the kids , great views , and made for a great place to relax after a busy day . The master suite was also spacious and had double sinks . The work ##out area was f ##abulous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A once grand hotel and Playboy Club showing its age . Need ##s some up ##dating , but overall a plea ##su ##rable stay . We had one issues and it was immediately taken care of . The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is just steps away from the north end of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice property within walking distance of the park . The rooms with the best views are on the top floor which seem to cost a premium . View ##s of Lake Michigan are o ##bs ##truct ##ed unless you are on a higher floor . In my case $ 35 was asked for a better room . I did not wish to pay this sur ##cha ##rge and was put on the 21st floor ( See picture ) . Staff is very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , clean rooms , friendly staff . Walk ##able to many locations with lots of restaurant options nearby . Con ##cier ##ge gave us great advice on using public transportation . W ##i ##F ##i was a little won ##ky and we didn ’ t get our free cocktail ##s upon checking in , but all other amenities were excellent , so we ’ ll definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thank you to Veronica Navarro for quickly getting us set up for a last minute business meeting . We were at another hotel for a conference and meeting space was unavailable . Our hotel contact connected us to Veronica and she took very good care of us . I want to also mention that we had excellent support with our A ##V , Chris Hamilton ##a and Joshua and Randy in banquet ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House Hotel is un ##beat ##able for all the right reasons - comfort , location , amenities , lobby , classic hotel . The Corner Baker ##y downstairs is delicious for breakfast and very reasonable . Mike and Matt are the two best bell hop ##s ever . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the hotel and location . Service fantastic from start to end . Love the key ##card for elevator . Only suggestion is to have the card ##io exercise room cooler . Very warm . We had 2 joining rooms and kids loved the large pool . Will stay here next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for one night in a river - facing room on the 12th floor . The king - sized bed was comfortable and the bathroom spot ##less . The 12th floor was high enough that street noise was minimal and did not bother me at all . The service was cheerful and pleasant . Overall - a te ##rri ##fic experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Shan ##L ##a H . And Jordan helped me at the front desk even after shift change they were willing and ready to assist me . Along with Ms Garrett ( who di ##ligent ##ly provides the same services after hours ) . Seriously you made my stay very warm and comfortable and plan on staying here exclusively when in Chicago [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is ok for location and a ' roof over your head ' . . . but check in staff were slow , rude and abrupt . Room was again just ok , aside from the p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper and the broken f ##au ##ce ##ts . This wouldn ' t be so bad if these guys didn ' t have a 4 * classification ! Staff at the Potter ##s bar were ok but exceptionally slow and forget ##ful . Room service was excellent though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Hotel with great views of the City of Chicago . Guest services were excellent . En ##joy ##ed the experience ! Stay ##ed for 5 days on business . Many of the meeting venues were in the hotel . All very good . Food service excellent Meeting accommodation ##s were also excellent . Location was ex ##cell ##H ##igh ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Park ##ing was way too much for overnight parking , took a while to retrieve car when ready to go . Good location , nice restaurant , good food , service was different , I re ##cie ##ved my food about 20 minutes before my other 3 guests got there ##s . Being a gentleman , I waited until they re ##cie ##ved th ##iers so mine was cold when I got to eat it . I don ' t understand the delay in getting food delivered to every guest at the table at the same time . No ##is ##y en ##vior ##ment , TV was playing and they wouldn ' t turn on the game we wanted to watch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pleasant staff and very helpful . Room was spacious and clean ##ly kept . The hotel in close walking distance from nice eat ##eries and bars . The food provided on property was also exceptional . I would definitely recommend the hotel to a friend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean place with good service and location . Not a top luxury hotel in layout or accommodation ##s , but a good value overall . Staff is professional and nice . Not a single TV in the bar / lounge or common areas , so forget about watching the game while your significant other is getting ready . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the s ##wi ##sso ##tel for 3 nights and enjoyed all aspects of our visit . The hotel staff was very professional and I believe his name was De ##met ##rian was especially helpful and friendly . We also enjoyed the pass to the work ##out facility that s ##wi ##sso ##tel partners with . It had extensive options and you could access it through the underground hallway system ( which in and of itself was cool ) . Our room was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable . We had a beautiful view from the 20th floor . We would stay again next time we ’ re in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad was the perfect Hotel to explore Chicago . Effect ##ively on Michigan Avenue . The hotel is comfortable with a great contemporary feel to it . The Hotel team were all so friendly and helpful and the food was delicious . The bedrooms were so comfortable and each had a luxurious bathroom . The best place to stay in Chicago Randolph and Catherine [SEP]
0	[CLS] Good hotel with very nice architecture in the middle of downtown . This hotel is close to just about everything in downtown Chicago . The room are decent , clean and quiet ; the beds are very comfortable for a great nights sleep . The hotel has a couple of restaurants with a wide variety of menu choices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What and amazing [UNK] . I say experience because it was less of a hotel stay and more of an overall experience ! The look and de ##cor of the hotel and our room was absolutely stunning ! The hotel staff was so helpful with directions , helping set up the river boat [UNK] architectural tour ( must do ! ) , and suggesting places to see or restaurants to din ##e at . Did I mention the location ! ! ! W ##OW ! You can easily walk to Michigan Ave , or along the river walk , or catch the train to W ##rig ##ley . I love the Kim ##pton Hotel brand and the Monaco didn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . We will stay there every time we ' re in Chicago for [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed the weekend at the Ta ##lbert celebrating my twin girls birthday . This hotel is so D ##AR ##L ##ING ! The v ##ibe is vintage / modern , very cool , clean and a bout ##ique feel . All of the staff were outstanding , especially the door ##man Charles . The rooms were large and very nice . The bar was perfect and very co ##zy and the food was truly O ##UT ##ST ##AN ##DI ##NG ! This is our new place to stay every time we go to Chicago . We loved it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice clean place to stay . The view of Chicago from upper levels and pool was beautiful . The suites were very nice . Kitchen clean and cute . The beds were nice and comfortable . And it was close to al ##ot of eat ##ery ' s and markets . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel Monaco is a Kim ##pton hotel in the heart of Chicago close to everything . The staff is well trained and extremely service and guest friendly oriented . The rooms are decent . The shower pressure and hot water is ample . They offer limited in room dining which is my only draw ##back . Yes there are hundreds of places to eat in a 3 - block radius but when you ' re in town on business and have work to do in the evening and just want the convenience of room service , their offering di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel over the Thanksgiving weekend and it was a wonderful experience . The room was very clean and nice size . Dan was awesome and helpful ! All the staff was pleasant , smiled , and spoke every time we entered or left the property . The breakfast was a nice touch with a variety of options . We did not make it to the afternoon / evening reception - we will take that up next time , as we plan to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel location is great . Yard ##s from Michigan but without the chaos . You are greeted by a v ##alet with a smile who asks that you check in on the 20th floor . More smiling , happy folks at the reception desk . Our room was remarkable . The view was te ##rri ##fic but the room was taste ##fully appointed ( a bit on the modern side ) . We had breakfast at the hotel daily and was very good . The compliment ##ary " juice " of the day was kinda cool . R ##oof top bar was hop ##ping and comfortable . All in all , young very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , great location and service . We have stayed in Chicago many times . Our new go to place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel in the northern part of the city centre of Chicago , metro station 10 minutes walking , several bus stops nearby . Room ##s quite big and comfortable . El ##eva ##tors more or less from the last century . I ##dea ##lly for a city stay for a couple of days . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an older classic hotel near the loop and in close proximity to the Art Institute , Cloud Gate , " the bean " and Maggie Dale ##y Park . I took my kids for the last weekend in December and we had a ball ! The staff was outstanding and the hotel was reminiscent of and Art Dec ##o era ! The rooms can be small ##ish , but the beds comfortable . The lobby is gorgeous and was bust ##ling . Not once did we encounter a cross staff member . En ##joy ##ed looking at the old movie star pictures that played the Empire Room there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed our room online . Zero issues during our stay . This place is f ##abulous for a get ##away . This is our second time staying here and it ' s been enjoyable . Clean quiet rooms . Close to everything we are looking for . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just finished a 5 day conference with Randy White working as our Ban ##quet Manager . He was amazing ! He was very at ##ten ##tive and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our needs . He knew the schedule of our conference events and checked in frequently to make sure things were running smoothly . Very professional and helpful . Thanks to Randy our conference was a success ! Thanks Randy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quiet spacious rooms with great location . Lo ##bby bar gets very noisy when groups con ##ver ##ge there which makes check in a challenge . Location for access to Millennium park and Art Institute easy . Fitness center has mirrors for view only . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our fourth long weekend in Chicago and our most disappointing hotel experience . The room and bathroom are small and the bathroom lacks a fan , so it steam ##s up and you also hear all your travel companion ' s bathroom noises . U ##gh . The TV clarity is poor and so is the station selection . They charge for W ##i ##F ##i , although they waived the charge at check - in ! The beds were sq ##ue ##ak ##y and the pillows are b ##lah , with little support . Our other downtown hotels , similarly priced , also had a free happy hour for guests , which was an added bonus . You can do better than the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for your Chicago visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location with a comfortable room and the evening social was a nice addition . The room was clean with nice spaces . The space for the breakfast and social was te ##rri ##fic . The quality of the food was not superb for all parts . . maybe a bit better quality coffee or wine available would be nice . It was very convenient in it ' s location and the staff were polite , friendly and professional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently got an invite to the black tie opening for the Chicago auto show . After enjoying endless food and drink and many beautiful cars that you could actually sit in . We chose to stay at the nearby Fair ##mont Hotel . We stayed on the gold level 15th floor . Which has a delicious hot breakfast and a light dinner included with the room at an affordable price . The view was fantastic and the bed was even better . We live in the greatest city in the world . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , excellent location . Staff consistently friendly and helpful . Bed com ##fy . Love the happy hour and free breakfast . Only suggestion would be more choice on room service , with some more healthy options . Will be back in April . Thank you to the wonderful staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is perfectly situated to take advantage of everything that Chicago has to offer . We booked several rooms for friends and family . The shop ##pers in the group were able to take advantage of the Black Friday deals while the younger kids enjoyed the pool . Starting our day with the O ##m ##ni breakfast was a highlight . Great value and a hotel that does not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well trained staff , comfortable rooms , best value for such a big city . I stay there often . Hotel was doing some up ##dating and cleaning . . it was a bit noisy but the staff was a ##pol ##og ##etic about any in ##con ##ven ##ience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel with some nice staff . But , we took a suite and grew frustrated with having to call for coffee / shower gel every day . Dirty glasses left in the room and not cleaned and a coffee machine that broke & took 36 hours to replace . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent the weekend in Chicago with two girlfriend ##s to run the marathon . The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker was a perfect choice for us , great proximity to walk to Michigan avenue and places to eat and shop , but removed enough from the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le to still be peaceful and relaxing when we needed down time . Beautiful inside and out , lovely staff , very nice stay ! We would choose this hotel again in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the Fair ##mont for a conference . I came back to my room a few hours after checking in and the ceiling in my bathroom had started leaking . Maintenance couldn ' t figure out why it was leaking , and they wouldn ' t give me a new room without an up ##cha ##rge . The only thing they did was lay down towels on my floor . It stopped leaking eventually , but it dripped for almost 24 hours . I ' m extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service at this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has very friendly staff who go that extra mile to make sure you are taken care of . The room was always clean , the amenities were great . The only down side was that when there is bad weather , the local television goes out . But the w ##if ##i is great and you can get to everything fast and easy . The hotel was walking distance from just about everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is right in the middle of great shopping . It was never above 20 degrees while we were there , so having a short walk to Sa ##ks , N ##eim ##ans and Bloom ##ing ##dale ##s was very important . Our suite was on 25th floor and we had a wonderful view . It was large enough for me and my 2 grown daughters . I slept on the pull out couch and it wasn ' t bad at all . Thanks , O ##m ##ni , for making our stay so special ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Manager S ##ge ##pha ##no needs to be replaced . He is lacking customer service for such a high end hotel . Was charged for mini bar $ 9 . 00 and did not use along with $ 85 . 00 1 day v ##alet that I did not use . Contact ##ed manager and he refused to check into it and or credit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The front staff said the hotel has new owners . They have some work to do . Restaurant is closed for renovations . Coffee in the am is $ 3 . 50 . The light was out in our room but they fixed it . The air condition ##er sounds like a jet engine . There were not enough towels . We paid lots of money and were disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] for north Chicago it was perfect , and economical for the night . just needed a place to stay for the cu ##bs world series game and it fit the bill . 4 miles away and an easy driver . one problem was that the rooms for a lot of the guests checking in were not ready , and we an hour late checking in . and the staff handled it wonderful ##ly , there were some crab ##by people , and they were very professional , even when taking a bunch of static from guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay at the Hilton . Luc ##re ##cia who cleaned our room each day is the ambassador for this hotel . Her smile , great service , and making sure we had what we needed was amazing . Of course there is a but . . . . I wanted to let someone in the hotel know about their amazing employee and this hotel has no way to do this . What happened to the Co ##mme ##nt cards that would allow me to acknowledge her . S ##hame on you Hilton that I had to go to social media to let you know about your great employee . Thanks Luc ##re ##cia . You are special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a diamond member , I was upgraded to the lake view room . even I used to watch it every day nearby , it was still a good gesture . The breakfast was decent . The dinner was quite different , the first day the service was great and the 2nd day no one saw me and I stayed for five minutes and left for another one . The gym is probably one of the best . I wish they could extent the hour a little bit . 9 ##pm is too early to be close . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean new rooms with good beds and pillows . Quiet with good elevator system . Check in process was not good . Room was not ready upon arrival . Was told they would text me when the room was ready and that never happened . When I returned to check in the attitude of the employee was that they were doing me a favor . Poor customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location along the magnificent mile . Older building which gives it plenty of character but there is a down ##side . Since it ' s older , they can only have either the air conditioning on or the heat . Not both . Since it was still cool , the heat was on . When the temperature rose on our second day there , it became uncomfortable in the room . We opened the window which took care of the temperature but let in the city sounds which really wasn ' t bad . I didn ' t have a problem but I can see where others could . The room was on the small side but was quite comfortable . I would go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for a whole week . The location was great - close to everywhere I needed to be , and near the shops / Mill ##eni ##um park / Ma ##g Mile . I ' m used to staying at much larger hotels in Chicago , so this was a welcome change . It ' s much more manage ##able and the service is more personal . The service here was great - they are all friendly and helpful . Lots of nice touches at the hotel - free ( good ) coffee in the mornings , free wine in the evenings . The rooms were straightforward but nice , and the beds were comfortable . I ' d definitely come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Were in Chicago for three days . The location is in the theater district and within walking distance of the Art Institute can ' t be beat . The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and steered us to some excellent places to eat and to enjoy live music and drinks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Let me first start by saying that I have stayed at the R ##itz , Four Seasons , and the peninsula in downtown Chicago and the Conrad is right up there with all three . The location of the hotel is perfect . The rooms are well designed . We have beautiful views from the room . The staff has been wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . It comes with compliment ##ary breakfast due to diamond status . The only problem is that it is a little noisy at the side of balcony seems coming from some electronic devices . And there is no option to stop the buzzing . Finally get some sleep anyway . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Suite was spacious and clean with a great view - the perfect place to come back to after a long day of exploring . Staff were all super friendly and helpful . Great location : we loved walking to the River ##walk and down to the lake ; and super easy access to public transportation . Also plenty of great food nearby . S ##hout out to Jason who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and took great care of us ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is well located and has a good range of facilities for conference attendees . I stayed on for a couple of extra nights and it was good from that perspective . The con ##cier ##ge staff were helpful . I did have some problems using the electronic room key though . The room was good with plenty of power points . The breakfast b ##uff ##et isn ' t great value though so I only used it once . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have visited before and always enjoy it . As with most old hotels the rooms are not huge but they are clean and comfortable . The bar scene is vibrant and the morning breakfast is good . The overall am ##bie ##nce is excellent . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nice , ex ##cel ##ent . I recommend this hotel y you are thinking to visit Chicago . The location is excellent ( near the shops ) and the metro . The price is good . If I travel to Chicago again , likely I will choose Home Suite ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] View of my particular room wasn ' t great , but the room itself had a great ( comfortable ! ) bed , fantastic shower with lots of ( very ! ) hot water and strong water pressure , and house ##keeping did a really great job ( re ##ple ##nish ##ing towels and toilet ##ries , etc ) . The con ##cier ##ge was friendly and helpful , as was the bar staff at the hotel lounge . Free juice and coffee in the morning and free prose ##cco at 5 ##pm . Great location . The only ( slightly ) negative thing I have to comment on , is that the walls are paper - thin , and you hear pretty much everything from the rooms next to you , and in the hallway . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted for work for 4 nights : can ’ t fault the place , it does well on almost every front , and also tries to have some charm which is hard to come back in North America . I didn ’ t fall in love with the place but at least it tries . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great experience at that hotel . It is well located , has a great bar and restaurant downstairs and the rooms are class ##y , com ##fy and clean . Travis at the front desk made my stay even more comfortable by up ##grading me to a junior suite . He was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , really court ##eous and friendly and I received excellent service . I travel to ch ##ica ##go quite frequently and will plan on staying at the Public again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for a girls weekend . We contacted the con ##cier ##ge , Sheila G ##ar ##g , before our trip and she was un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly helpful . She welcomed us upon arrival , added even more restaurant and site seeing options , and even sent a little treat up to our room . The front desk was very at ##ten ##tive and friendly . The evening happy hour is a nice little touch . This hotel is in a great location , steps from a Star ##bu ##cks and an Irish Pub across the street . We were able to walk to great shopping and the Chicago Institute of Arts . Great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here many times , and this was another excellent stay . The lobby / bar area is beautiful . The location is right in the middle of downtown with plenty of restaurants within walking distance . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is amazing , the staff were great and the location is perfect . They even have me a gift for my birthday . I definitely will only stay here when I visit Chicago . There is also a self parking garage right around the corner if you want to save a few dollar ##d . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I thought this place was great , the wife and I had a stay ##cation there and it was very romantic . Great location by the river , nice room , leopard bath ##robe ##s , easy access to Chicago ' s wonders . Just go outside the hotel for breakfast ( south water kitchen sucks ) . Also there ' s a free wine and coffee hour [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel on multiple occasions . The staff is always very court ##eous . It is always clean . The rooms are spacious . It is close to everything . You can get a room with a view of the river . The only one little small thing I would mention is that there store doesn ' t have a lot in it . There is a large lobby bar that is always lively . It is about 1 . 16 miles from the train station , walking distance to shopping , etc . I felt safe walking alone from this hotel to various locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I went to Chicago to see the Beauty and the beast . Hotel is literally next door what made me decide for it . Walking distance to all downtown Chicago attractions . Our room was very small but well decorated and clean . They have happy hour at the lobby on Friday ##s and Saturdays . I don ##t know if they have it during the week . Staff is very polite and at ##ten ##tive to your needs . Park ##ing is $ 60 a night . If you go to Spot ##her ##o you can get parking in less than half a block for $ 25 a day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Door staff welcome you at each arrival with a smile and small conversation , very friendly . The hotel restaurant , 67 ##6 , has great options for a g ##lut ##en free breakfast ! Room was nice , bed comfortable and staff ready to assist to make your stay even better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The All ##egro certainly lives up to the Kim ##pton standard - the staff is lovely , the rooms are beautiful and comfortable and the bar is top notch . I ' ve stayed at all the Kim ##pton in Chicago and really like the All ##egro ##s location - super convenient to Fulton Market where there ' s a pretty great food scene happening . Big thanks to Iris for taking such great care of us ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my family ' s first trip to Chicago . The hotel was beautiful and in a perfect location . Every staff member we encountered was wonderful ! La ##to ##ya at the Con ##ce ##ir ##ge Des ##k sent us to great restaurants and gave ideas for fun activities . I had to work with one of the managers , An ##is , when my mother fell ill during our trip . Both he and La ##to ##ya were absolutely wonderful and helpful ! Will stay here every time we return to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this hotel on a w ##him after reviewing the website . Before our arrival , we received a welcome letter from Travis , the guest relations man ##ger . Nice touch ! The suite was wonderful as was Travis ! In fact , the entire staff was helpful and friendly . We had a fantastic stay and will definitely stay here on return visits . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is perfect ; the Star ##bu ##cks attached to the hotel is great for interviews . The hotel staff is extra ##ord ##ina ##rily professional , from the welcoming check - in to the willingness to answer questions to the check - out and the door ##man who helps with bags . I really do not consider any other hotel chain . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great 2 night stay here . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and breakfast was outstanding . My room was clean and the AC worked really good . The fact the the lobby was on the 6th floor was weird . I was with a work group and the meeting accommodation ##s were very reasonable too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was recently renovated with spacious suites and very comfortable beds . There is a pull out couch as well but we didn ' t use it . Kitchen area with microwave , coffee maker , toast ##er , dishes etc to prepare meals or snack ##s . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary b ##uff ##et breakfast was delicious . There is also a compliment ##ary afternoon social with beer , wine , and app ##eti ##zers . The staff is very friendly and helpful . I would highly recommend the Hit ##on Home ##wood Suite ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had an extended stay at the public / ambassador hotel for nearly the entire 2017 , getting to know the staff and living through the hotel renovation . The staff is spectacular and the new Booth One is a tremendous addition . Hat ##s off to Rich Melanie and Kevin Brown of Let ##tu ##ce . While I ’ m a Gold Coast resident and the hotel is local , I highly recommend Ambassador for both a business or personal stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had by pure luck selected a corner room with tons or windows and closet space . The room was beautiful with floor to ceiling windows , dual sinks in the bathroom and separate toilet and shower area . The really like the power windows shades . We only stayed one night , wish it has been longer . Check your bill as I drove up in a rental car that I returned later that day , I was billed for parking . Breakfast in the hotel as excellent , but price ##y You can ##t go wrong with this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love this hotel . The rooms are clean and comfortable , it ' s in a great part of town , and the staff is te ##rri ##fic . I have stayed here many times , and I have always had a good experience . There is no doubt that I ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel Monaco is Top - Not ##ch ! We celebrated 2 family birthday ##s and the entire staff was very helpful and friendly and con ##cier ##ge was phenomena ##l . The amenities , presentation and location were all things I ' ve come to expect from a Top - 10 Hotel and The Monaco lived up to it . . especially at an incredible value ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] his was our second time at this hotel ! Location great , you are able to walk to restaurants , shopping and lots of interesting architecture . We enjoyed our daily walks . The service was excellent , . We had a corner suite , plenty of room for the 3 of us . The views were awesome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every ##time we come to Chicago we pick the Talbot ##t for their f ##abulous con ##cier ##ge Gene . He always goes above and beyond to make our visits special and memorable . We had another wonderful weekend and he had awesome recommendations for us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We met in the Gold Coast a year ago and this quickly became our place for weekend get ##away ##s ! I reached out to Travis to set up the same room we had to celebrate our anniversary ! Was great to be back , the v ##alet guys all remembered us and welcomed us home . Grace at the front desk was b ##ub ##bly and excited to say hello ! Sean at the bar was fantastic as was R ##omi ##ero and Marie ! Sad to learn that so many people had left since we were last there in November . The new hallway ##s look great , nice way to bright ##en it up . The new carpet in the room is ok . Thank you Ambassador you will always hold a special place in our heart ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We found a blood stain on the sheet in the bed , house ##keeping was nice and came to change them out . She was the nice ##st staff member there . Everyone else was so dry and serious , definitely not friendly . That Chi Bar downstairs has the worst service I ’ ve ever had . Because if them I would never come back ever . Not a great experience at all . 3 stars because house ##keeping was awesome , if it wasn ’ t for her , 1 Star . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ’ ve been staying at the Palmer House many times over the past several years . Always a great experience . Only complaint was the wait staff at the bar last night . Kind of slow . Otherwise , no complaints . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located in the best neighborhood , near very high end shops . Staff is friendly , helpful up ##beat . The hotel has a lovely , welcoming bout ##ique feel . The restaurant in the hotel is excellent . Will stay again next time in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for three nights at the end of May 2018 . No real issues , very nice room with a large comfortable bed . The hotel has plenty of character . The only ( slight ) down ##side was that the hallway ##s / corridors are a little tired and in need of a little re ##fu ##rb but overall a very good hotel . Location great too and not too far from a couple of nice breakfast restaurants and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Very enjoyable stay and the staff we encountered were all very helpful and pleasant , especially the bell ##boy with 20 + years at the hotel , a really pleasant character he was but can ’ t remember his name . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff at this hotel are so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful , it was nice to feel p ##amp ##ered while on a business trip ! They truly went above and beyond to take care of you . I would definitely stay here again for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If imp ##ec ##ca ##ble service is what you c ##rave , look no further than the Hotel Monaco ! We were greeted like VIP ##s for our recent anniversary weekend and the con ##cier ##ge Sheila was in ##com ##par ##able . The room was beautiful and well appointed , including a magnificent ##ly styled head ##board and marble counters in the bath . Great use of space in furniture placement as well . Gene ##rous closet ##s & co ##zy robes were just some of the premium ##s we appreciated . Hands ##ome , inviting lounge area in lobby with nice extra ##s like wine reception / bites . . . even a fun game to play while you wait for the elevator . Our stay at the Hotel Monaco was truly un ##su ##rp ##ass ##ed . We will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great time . Issues are minor : 1 ) parts of hotel were under renovation while we were there ( pool and lobby ) , and I was not aware this would be the case ; 2 ) no compliment ##ary coffee ( not even coffee maker in room ! ) ; 3 ) snack ##s are available for purchase in room and are placed out in the open , right next to TV - - it ' s very tough on kids ( and grown ##ups ! ) to stare at lots of y ##um ##my treats but not be able to eat . Wish they had been tucked away in cabinet or something where we could avoid . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The people here were so helpful and friendly . Hotel was clean and close to a lot of things to do in the area . The beds were interesting because of them being so low to the ground . The de ##cor and style was not my thing but it was not awful . Park ##ing is crazy at $ 67 a night . Would have liked a pool or something for the kids to do when we got back for the evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My only complaint was the quality of the bed pillows could have been better . Otherwise we were extremely happy with all of the service , location and the helpful ##ness of all concerned . We would stay here again . The wait staff in restaurant were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 2 nights to enjoy the holiday in Chicago . The location is good for the loop and ma ##g mile . Re ##ceived a nice upgrade to a suite . The staff is friendly and they provide great service . We are planning a visit early next year and Abdul took lots of time to answer my questions and worked to meet my requests . The restaurant , Fi ##sk & Co , has pleasant staff as well . We enjoyed their o ##yster happy hour . We relaxed and enjoyed the holiday lights around Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a weekend get ##away . We arrived at 3 : 30 on a Friday afternoon and there was no line to check in . The staff was friendly and quick . I reserved a nice Grand Tower Suite suite which was large , clean and well equipped including a Ke ##uri ##g coffee machine , robes and slip ##pers . The king bed was comfortable . The con ##cier ##ge was friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location for dining , shopping and a s ##tro ##ll to the air and water show . The staff was extremely friendly and the rooms were super clean . Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed the jazz trio for a couple hours on Friday night around the bar . Will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I chose this location because it was close to all of the things we wanted to do during out stay and I ' m very glad we chose it . We were near public transportation , had no issues getting an u ##ber or taxi , and were around many restaurants and shopping stores . Our room was very clean and the staff were very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect and cute room decoration . Great mini ##bar at a reasonable and affordable price ! Room service was quick and effective . But , when we first encountered our room , the bathing tub wasn ' t at its whites ##t form . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and the hotel was very comfortable . The elevators need an upgrade ! ! Overall the Hotel has a great bar and menu in the restaurant . They should also look at putting auto on lights in the closet ##s so you don ' t have to use the pull chain . Also . look at putting in dim ##mers for all lights ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for two nights over St . Patrick ' s Day weekend . The city was very quiet , and the hotel was also . The staff ##er at registration booked us into a perfectly fine but pretty ordinary room . The chance came up to ask about a transfer to one of the more unique rooms - - there are many in this hotel - - and like that , it was done . Lo ##bby bar was peaceful for a really pleasant winding down after long walks around the city and at the lake . I did not get the names of the people on staff who so professionally helped us switch rooms - - but if management happens to read this , they were working late morning on Saturday , March 16 - - and they made the difference between a four - star and a five - star review . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is one of our top three spaces in Chicago . We don ’ t stay at the hotel , we just visit this space for the artistic architecture . We grab a drink and walk around in awe looking at the funk ##y designs and op ##ulent accent ##s . Duck ##D ##uck ##G ##o pictures of this place and then visit . You will not be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check - In was a breeze , but bags to forever to get from bell ##man . Had to call to ask where luggage was . But everyone was nice , and AL ##WA ##Y ##S helpful ! Room was nice , and house ##keeping was wonderful . Would highly recommend ! Nice hotel ! Sue [SEP]
0	[CLS] O ##m ##ni Chicago is always our favorite place to stay in Chicago ! O ##m ##ni Chicago is central ##ly locate ##s for the f ##abulous shopping on the Ma ##g and stuffed pizza right around the corner . The staff is always professional , friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a couple of nights for a family vacation . Beautiful lobby and great history on display . Very good br ##unch at Kitty O ' Shea ##s ( one of the hotel restaurants ) . Re ##quest a high floor for the better views . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There is not a lot else to say than " Great to stay if you want to discover Chicago " ! The hotel is very good and the rooms spacious , clean and well equipped . We didn ' t enjoy any service like breakfast or dinner because you ' ve got plenty of choices with a better value for the money . The location is perfect with easy access to everything in walking distance . Whether it is Navy Pier , the cruise ##s to discover the channels or any other place , you can walk it . Park ##ing is a bit of rip - off but that ' s the case for all of those hotel chains . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to stay an extra night and within 1 hour we had a room book at the H ##ya ##tt . We arrived expecting to have them hold our luggage until check in but our room was already for us which made it super convenient and allowed us to get on with our day much sooner than expected . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed the Loop location of Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago . Room was clean , spacious and quite . The king sized bed was firm , and comfortable . The bathroom has a tub and separate shower . The water pressure is lacking . Small fridge was nice , as it does not contain pressure sensitive , over - priced items ; you can actually use it for your own purpose . Staff is okay , with the cleaning staff the best , bell service next , yet front staff lame . W ##i - Fi is a joke . Good location , okay price , useless , over ##p ##rice ##d restaurant . Good for conferences . En ##joy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A bell ##hop entered my room un ##ann ##ounced while I was half dressed . There was no knock or warning , he just walked in . When I explained the incident to the staff , I was given two drink tickets for the trouble . Then when I used the one drink ticket on a Diet Coke and a glass of $ 14 wine , the Diet Coke was com ##p - ed from the check . I know that the normal protocol is to com ##p the cheap ##est item being a server / bartender for years but the fact that seeing me half dressed was worth a $ 5 Diet Coke is insulting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Although our stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was brief . We were welcomed warmly by well trained staff and made to feel comfortable . This is my second stay at this hotel and I look forward to the opportunity of staying there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for several nights with friends who were travelling with us . What an amazing hotel ! Its so big its easy to get lost ! Room ##s were super . Staff amazing and the whole v ##ibe was brilliant . St ##ets ##ons restaurant serves some of the best food ever ! The location of the hotel is perfect . Love ##ly views of the river and well situated to walk to shops . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Q ##ua ##int hotel in an awesome location . The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and our room was great . Spa ##cious with comfortable beds . Despite overlooking a decent ##ly busy street , noise was not an issue . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the All ##egro during a business trip to Chicago . This was our first time in Chicago and it could not have been better . The hotel is convent to great dining and the theaters . All of the staff was so helpful and was very at ##ten ##tive to our needs . The hotel room was beyond spot ##less . I was a little hesitant because it is dog friendly , but this was not a problem as the pet rooms are on the lower floors and the upper are not used for animals . Also , somehow I accidentally made reservations for two rooms and did not know it but not a problem because upon arrival they just cancelled the second room . Some hotels would have charged for this . If you looking for a great stay at a reasonable price this is your hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was the first time I stayed at a Kim ##pton property in Chicago . It is very similar to the one in Alexandria , VA . The location was near everything . Food , shopping and theaters were within walking distance . The deal we got was " Stay & Vale ##t " . I highly recommend it ! No worries about parking . The deal offers in and out parking privileges during your entire stay . Just pull up to the door and they handle it from there . I believe there was a self park option across the street as well . The room , though small was comfortable and well decorated . Check in and Check out was a breeze . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely the worst Hilton we have been to . The Executive rooms are a joke , as is the breakfast add - on . This executive room literally faced another building , had nothing extra in the room , and was dark with an odor . Front desk employees are un ##friend ##ly and have a racist demeanor . You are better off at Embassy Suite ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the perfect location for shopping in Chicago . Room ##s are a good size with very comfortable beds ! The higher floors will be quiet ##er to traffic noise . The gym and pool are outstanding . De ##fin ##ite ##ly worth checking out . So much history to this beautiful building ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful , historic building ! Love ##d old p ##ics and murals . Meeting rooms were comfortable and inviting . Hotel rooms were adequate but not cleaned daily . So thrilled to have Star ##bu ##cks on premises . Would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in June 2018 Good hotel , staff were friendly and welcoming . Happy hour from 5 - 6 ##pm for hotel guests , received free prose ##cco or sang ##ria upon showing hotel key card which we tried to take advantage of throughout our stay , was great ! Hotel lobby was lovely , had perfect amount of seating and bar , decorated nicely and buzzing in the evenings . Room was nice , view of the building next door wasn ##t great but next time we ' ll request a room with a view . Dec ##or was a little dated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were delighted with our stay at the All ##egro . It ' s a fantastic location , right next door to the Cadillac Theater . Kim ##pton did a wonderful job turning this older building into a charming hotel . The lobby has a re ##tro , cool feel to all of the furnishings , artwork , and light fixtures . There ' s a 5 p . m . reception every evening in the lobby , and you kind of just want to spend time in this lovely setting . The rooms were also beautiful - everything is updated , but keeping some details of the original building . The compliment ##ary wine / cocktail reception in the evening , and coffee / tea / hot chocolate in the morning were very nice touches . I really like Kim ##pton hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Management and staff services were excellent . Food service was very good . Location was perfect for guest and family . Bar lounge food and drinks were reasonably priced . Room was clean ; bathroom was im ##ma ##culate . Unfortunately , the room was very small and provided limited seating . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Couldn ' t have made a better choice for our 25th anniversary . The staff is fantastic , from Diana at check - in to Ash at the door . Just fantastic and helpful people . The hotel is located in the center of it all . Don ' t go ##og ##le where to go eat , just walk around the block and pick a new restaurant for lunch and dinner . Our room was beautiful ! We were in 1904 . That ' s the top floor , southeast corner . The suite had a kitchen , pull out sofa and a separate bedroom . Beautiful views , super clean room and it am ##az ##es me how quiet it can be in the room . Get up early for breakfast . It really gets packed in the later hours , but the selections are awesome . We love this place and will definitely be coming back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] You won ' t be disappointed if you choose to stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel in downtown Chicago . The location is f ##abulous and close to everything . The staff is outstanding and will take care of your every need . . . their attention to detail is amazing . The hotel has been re ##mo ##del ##ed and the rooms are very clean and beautifully decorated .

The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is the place to be when visiting Chicago ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is the second time I stayed at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago and both times the stays were f ##abulous . The staff was at ##ten ##tive , court ##eous , and polite . Despite being a " conference " hotel , service was outstanding ! Ku ##dos to the front desk staff , the workers who cleaned my room so well each day , and the service technicians who helped me through a problem . Will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker small suite room was beautiful and very quiet . Everything was wonderful . Service was at ##ten ##tive , the beds were comfortable , de ##cor updated and everything was clean . We had a great experience at this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] High luxury hotel ! At ##tended a wedding there . . . it was really amazing with all those sparkling ch ##and ##elier ##es and f ##abulous service . The restaurant had a large choice of dishes for breakfast , especially continental style . The bed in the room so comfortable with p ##amp ##ering sheets and du ##vet ##s . . . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location was nice and the room was clean ! Ho ##rrible hotel for a family . Bed ##s were small and the rooms were even smaller ! Hotel staff was not helpful and acted bothered when I contacted them . We asked for extra blankets and the ones they brought to the room , looked like they pulled them out of the garbage and they didn ’ t smell clean ! We stay in Chicago 10 - 15 times a year and I will never book this hotel again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Always great to come back to Chicago and staying at Hilton Chicago was amazing ! This classic hotel brings all of the history and el ##egan ##ce , but still keeps a warmth and friend ##liness that cannot be matched . Do not hesitate to book when coming home or just to spend a weekend in this incredible city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel . Only issue I initially had was the charge for use of fridge . After a chat with the con ##ce ##ier ##ge , the charge was dropped , and I was informed that there will not be charges in the future , so a m ##oot point for future travelers . Other than that very small hi ##cc ##up , I have no complaints . Everything is great , service is wonderful . Hu ##ge pool , great fitness center and in the middle of downtown Chicago . I recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at this hotel both on business and for leisure travel . My partner and I enjoyed the access to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and location on the Chicago River . On one stay it was fun to watch the runners on one leg of a marathon . The hotel is very close to the University of Chicago MBA building used for executives . Nearby is an interesting building used by a broadcaster that has stones on the wall taken from all over the world . The staff re ##sp ##ons ##ive ##ness is impressive . They helped my arrange a taxi to Evans ##ton as well as to the main campus of Chicago or to visit family members resident in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel room and accommodation ##s were less than desirable . The amenities that you would normally have in a Hilton . Like a coffee maker . Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tor etc . we ’ re not there . The rooms were small and bathroom ##s tiny . The parking was valid ##ated and then at check ##out were charged to you room @ $ 50 a day . Big surprise ! Location was near everything and staff was nice . The re was no con ##ce ##ier ##ge to ask questions or help with logistics The entrance and where to park was confusing . Everything was self help . I will not stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] My son ' s wedding reserved a block of rooms and Linda Home ##l and Au ##dra Coleman were outstanding in their service to us . Any changes , no matter how many , how complicated or how close to the event were handled calmly , professionally , and in a manner that made me think we were the most important event there . Thank you Linda and Au ##dra ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is a bout ##iq ##e hotel . The lobby is small and efficient . There is an included breakfast room for continental breakfast coffee and tea . The lo ##cat ##on is convenient . I walked to the theater district in a ##bo ##urt 10 - 15 minutes and then headed the other direction for 1 - - 15 minutes to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for shopping . The room was large and clean [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed conference for small organization here . A bit more expensive than nearby hotels by $ 100 but well worth the s ##p ##lu ##rge ! The comfort , service , quality , and accommodation ##s are excellent add to that the warmth and gene ##ros ##ity of the professional staff and you have the pleasure of a well executed conference that provided a beautiful view of the magnificent city and offered every access , every requested need met and no request un ##met . Work met , family friendly , comfortable rooms and luxurious amenities . Well appointed large rooms and quietly situated on the magnificent mile ! The food is f ##abulous too ! Thanks Conrad Chicago ! World Class ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] There are so many things to love about the O ##m ##ni Chicago - - the location , the food , the rooms , the casual luxury . . . But perhaps the thing that makes the O ##m ##ni so special is the warm , welcoming , friendly service you can count on every visit . The team at O ##m ##ni - - from the person who greet ##s you at the front door to the front desk staff to the house ##keeping and room service employees - - are friendly , helpful , genuinely interested in making your stay great , and overall just happy people . They seem to truly enjoy their job and their warm enthusiasm is con ##tag ##ious . Bravo , O ##m ##ni ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and view . The room was clean and well appointed . Overall great property with pleasant staff , good ( but expensive ) dining , and close walk to shopping , sights ##ee ##ing , great restaurants , and transportation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The clean and updated modern hotel is tucked in the middle of the vibrant River North district . The front desk staff are so helpful and friendly with pet accommodation ##s , directions , local hot ##sp ##ots . The food beverage and house ##keeping staff were so clean , polite and court ##eous . The breakfast bar on each floor was filled with healthy fresh choices too and management was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and generous with arranging a beautiful conference room for two of my business meetings . Top - notch will visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We remember the Ambassador East and P ##ump Room from the past and were hoping for something similar . Whenever we were passing through the lobby the new restaurant , Booth One , was either closed or closing , including the bar . That made no sense for mid afternoon or 9 : 30 at night . The bed was comfortable . The furniture didn ' t fit the room , the sofa was dirty , the television and floor lamp were oversized and in the way , the bathroom mirror was cracked and house ##keeping has no ability to clean the corners of a square sink . A red ##ec ##ora ##ted lobby and fresh coat of paint does not go far enough to re ##vi ##tal ##ize this establishment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel and location Staff is professional and court ##eous Room ##s are comfortable Food was great Enough hang ##ers in the closet which is always appreciated A ##pp ##re ##cia ##te having quick access to the market for late night snack ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay at the All ##egro most often when we visit Chicago because of the great location , staff and the hosted wine hour . : ) On our recent stay , we were happily greeted by Bryant who checked us in with a smile , and was especially a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting with a special request for a future stay . ( Yes , we are booked to return in a few months . ) Yes , the rooms can be small ( but not all of them ) . Our biggest room complaint is that there isn ' t much space in the bathroom to set out toilet ##ries for two people . One of the things ( besides hosted wine hour ) that we most like about Kim ##pton hotels is their commitment to diversity , especially evident during Pride month . Thank you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My boyfriend booked a suite there for our anniversary . The suite was incredible well furnished and class ##y : baroque details above the bed , au ##da ##cious choice of patterns for the linen ##s , lovely no ##ok ##s with pillows next to the windows , where , with the sun , it was a pleasure just to lay down with a book and a cup of tea . The private j ##ac ##uz ##zi is a must . The staff was great and very kind to us . But , as a minus for the service , I still don ' t understand why the W ##if ##i is not included in the price of the room . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front staff was nice but breakfast staff ( although , me ##xi ##can guy was really nice ) , grab n go cafe staff , all rude and not helpful . If you are going to Chicago , I would recommend getting hotel near MA ##G ##NE ##FI ##CE ##NT MI ##LE ##S , and other hilt ##on type brand at least . Not this one ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Very friendly staff . Love ##d breakfast our room . I Wish there would have been other options for W ##i ##F ##i . I wasn ' t going to pay 10 bucks , on a 300 dollar room . . The surprise birthday treat for my 10 year old grand ##augh ##ter was great surprise [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago is running very smoothly despite the weeks - long strike by hotel workers . When I arrived , I was greeted promptly and escorted me past the noise makers . Sean at the front desk was very professional and polite and helped find a room that worked well for me , allowing me in well before normal check - in time so I could work during the afternoon in a comfortable space . My group visited the hotel ' s dinner restaurant and breakfast restaurant and both were very good . Everything is running smoothly so k ##udo ##s to all the Hilton employees who are stepping up to make this happen . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##led to Chicago in January 2017 for a business meeting - - the meeting was successful , the accommodation ##s were great , and the recommendations for food were perfect . The trip was made perfect by the help of Thomas at the front desk . He was a constant help with everything . Very friendly and made life easy for the extended stay . Thomas is great ! Sterling J . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in the inter ##continent ##al for two night . The staff were welcoming . The hotel was clean . Great location right on magnificent mile . The room was a little warm and the air con didn ' t seem to turn down . Otherwise loved our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I traveled to Chicago for our daughter ' s volleyball tournament and stayed at the Hilton Chicago . The hotel is historic , but you would never know it . It ' s rooms are s ##pec ##ious and updated . The staff was friendly and helpful . Since this hotel is situated on Michigan Avenue , there is a lot to see and do within walking distance . However , if you need to travel a bit further , public transportation is close , taxi ##s are waiting outside the hotel , and U ##ber drivers are an easy option . Overall , this is a great place to stay when visiting Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was travelling th ##ru Chicago on business and decided to stay down town . I was glad I did . This hotel is very nice and is within walking distance of everything in the down town area . I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good not great rooms are nice by older , gym is small but works . Bar was quiet and not too busy . W ##if ##i works good and staff was cool and nice . I ' d say it is walking distance to a bunch of r ##ad places downtown . It ' s better for singles or business people , it ' s not a family hotel for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice location , near the front ##lake in a relatively quiet street . Room of good size and also the bathroom . It ' s clean with co ##ffe ##maker . El ##eva ##tors to upgrade ( don ' t try to be more than 6 . . . ) . Co ##rre ##ct breakfast [SEP]
1	[CLS] The 14 story hotel opened in 1927 , costing $ 3 , 000 , 000 to build . It has , obviously survived the stock market crash , wars and flu ##ct ##uating economies . Among the many famous people who have stayed there are Richard Nixon , John F . Kennedy , Chief Justice Earl Warren , The Rolling Stones , Muhammad Ali , Daryl Hannah and Hugh He ##f ##ner . It is rumored that Al Cap ##one frequented the top floor where his brother supposed operated a casino and speak ##eas ##y . Only one of the hotels 3 elevators was able to reach that floor and in the 1980 ' s a secret door ( for quick escape ) was found leading to a stairway . The areas available to us during our tour ( Chicago Open House Weekend ) were nice but left us to believe that some up ##dating might be in order . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was perfect for our needs having a real fridge in the room was amazing . You go on these trips to eat and have fun and when your left ##overs don ’ t fit in a mini fridge it matters . I loves this place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Big hotel but poor service . Room wasn ’ t ready for over an hour when I tried to check in at 4 pm . Room services dishes outside door for 24 hours . Vale ##t made me wait 10 min ##s as he was out of the office washing his car . Not that impressive for price but nice looking hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed in for a business trip . Front Des ##k attendant was lovely & charming . I asked if there were any rooms with a King bed , but I was assigned a room with 2 double beds . The room does b ##oast a view overlooking the river which is quite nice . The room itself , though , needs some love . The furniture is chip ##ped & stained . The walls are stained . The shower curtain is stained . There are no distinguishing features that make the room stand out in a positive way . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a disappointing hotel experience & definitely not 4 - star hotel material . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for one night . Upon arrival I was greeted cheerful ##ly and the bell ##hop assisted me with my luggage . Once I mentioned I was celebrating an engagement , I was upgraded to the Presidential suite due to the fact that most of the rooms were booked for the night . The room was very comfortable and the hotel was a great location for shopping , and dining ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a really cute hotel , with lots of nice little touches . It is in a great location in the heart of the loop surrounded by tons of bars and restaurants , however with that the room was loud at night , I could hear the music from the surrounding bars when trying to go to sleep . There was also trash that was being emptied in the morning that woke me up . The breakfast was standard , but offered enough to fill me up ! Park ##ing at the hotel is expensive , I would suggest checking out spot hero because there are tons of self park garage ##s around . Sad ##ly I did not get to enjoy the drinks / snack in the evening . Overall I would stay here again for price and location , but I would pack a fan to drown out the noise ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was large and very clean . The bed was very comfortable and the hotel was very quiet for sleeping . Close to Chicago River and very scenic at night . Staff was cord ##ial and helpful when asked for advice [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a long time SP ##G member and Travel to Chicago often . However , this was my first time staying at the She ##rato ##n Grand . I should have stayed here sooner ! The staff at check - in and throughout my stay were wonderful ! Some of the best in Chicago . Well appointed rooms and everything you would expect from a She ##rato ##n . Keep up the great work ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great quiet hotel in a good location . I was in town for NE ##OC ##ON and we walked everyday the the merchandise ma ##rt . I ' ve stayed in Chicago closer to the Michigan Ave . and it can be noisy due to traffic . This hotel was quiet and comfortable . I would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We ' ve stayed in O ##m ##ni hotels across the nation , it ' s our preferred hotel line . And the one in Chicago stays true to the brand . The staff are one , if not THE , best group I ' ve encountered . Always friendly and helpful , always greet you with a smile , and always go out of their way to help you in any way the can . Chicago O ##m ##ni is no exception . They ' re awesome . The place itself retains a little of old Chicago el ##egan ##ce but is balanced with modern aesthetics . My suite was clean , spacious , comfortable and welcoming . Although I was there for business , it is ideal ##ly located for shopping and surrounded by amazing restaurants - from 5 star to mom - and - pop joints . You cannot go wrong with the Chicago O ##m ##ni . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in town for a few days , and decided to stay at the She ##rato ##n . This is a huge hotel in a great location . The lobby was buzzing ! The bathroom could have used a little work , but overall this is a great property ! I will definitely stay here again . The view was awesome too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a wonderful experience ! ! ! A first class hotel and a first class experience . Room was very functional , very attractive , and clean . Staff was outstanding . Food and drink was more than great . Great central location in the Loop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very positive experience with our stay last weekend ! The staff was friendly , experienced and service oriented . The room was exceptional - very clean , functional and had an amazing & comfortable bed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very nice . My room ( 30 ##9 ) had a large closet and , it was a very nice , quiet , clean room . The only challenge to anyone with knee problems is that the tub was very high - - and if I stayed again , I think I would request a hand ##ica ##pped room for that reason . The location is great - - and there are restaurants within walking distance if you want to r ##oam outside the hotel . It was a very pleasant stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall very good experience : close to shopping on Michigan Ave ; all staff extremely friendly and helpful ; rooms updated / nicely done ; bed comfortable . Breakfast b ##uff ##et fell below our experience compared with Home ##wood Suite ##s in San Diego and Ohio . The only fresh fruit was a basket of orange ##s . Yo ##gu ##rt was not in individual containers , but in one dish ( impossible to tell if Greek , ca ##lor ##ies per ounce , etc ) . No past ##ries - just bread and bag ##els . Warm food included eggs ( as expected ) , but then sa ##usage pat ##ties or sa ##usage g ##ra ##vy - no bacon . Again , small issues , but not what we typically experience at Home ##wood Suite ##s elsewhere in the US . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is ch ##ic and fun . The food is good . The meeting rooms are flexible . Some are on different levels and not the e ##asi ##est flow . Sleeping rooms could use a coffee maker . But the staff is remarkable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a great hotel ! As Hotel All ##egro is located in a beautiful historic building , the room was small ##ish , but comfortable and q ##ua ##int . The king - sized bed was extremely comfortable , especially after a long day . The staff was friendly and welcoming and seem to enjoy what they do . They even have someone on the ground level welcoming guests as they are coming and going . I also love the happy hour . . . a very nice touch ! It is located in a great part of town , where you are in walking distance to many restaurants and things to do . When I go back to Chicago , I will definitely be staying here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visit Chicago often . The Ki ##nz ##ie was great . Great location , great room , good breakfast - although strangely off the hallway on an upper floor . There were 4 of us - very comfortable in a 2 bed room . Although our view was a brick wall , we were quite happy in our room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed at the O ##m ##ni several times and it is always a great experience . Location is extremely convenient ( right in the middle of Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ) , close to all kinds of shopping , restaurants and sites . Staff is professional and friendly . Room ##s are very nice , clean and modern . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great proximity to a variety of restaurants and Millennium Park . Walking distance to the lake as well . Ask for a room with one of the window seats overlooking W ##aba ##sh - - a great place to curl up and watch a movie on a cold winter evening ! Watch out for hot chocolate bar in the lobby to warm up after a cold walk by the river ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco is a wonderful bout ##ique hotel , but what made it especially great is te service I received from the door ##man Michael B . I had two heavily packed bags that I was going to have to carry up the stairs to get on the el train . Michael walked the two blocks and carried my bags up the stairs . I couldn ' t have made it without him . Thanks for the outstanding service ! Also , my room had a huge , comfortable window seat with a spectacular view , great for relaxing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about my stay was amazing ( except the construction this morning ) ! Having the Palm on site , 24 hour convenience store , L ##OC ##AT ##ION ! Beautiful views ! Walking distance to the museum ! Just awesome ! Ruth was so nice and polite at check in ! Not that the other agents weren ’ t but she really went out of her way to make me feel welcome ! Thanks again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent , I ##ve stayed here a number of times but not in the 10 ##ye ##ars . We celebrated Thanksgiving B ##runch here . We were able to walk to the Thanksgiving Day Parade and perfectly located for some shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a king - bed corner room , which has windows on two sides . This type of room is worth the extra cost . The front desk staff were very helpful . The wine served at their happy hour was better than what you would normally receive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk customer service is horrible . I was waiting in line to check in but they were letting people skip the line in front of us . The room selection was bad . Take the time to listen and make everyone wait for their turns without skip ##ping the line . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel and the rooms , pool etc . the price was kinda high but other than that we loved it . The pool area was city view and my kids loved that . The breakfast seemed ok thou I did not get to eat any . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t there for a girls weekend - was the perfect place to stay . Clean , luxurious , friendly and close to everything . This hotel had comfortable beds and thick , high quality towels . I like clean and this place was im ##ma ##culate . Each floor had its own fresh coffee and rolls just steps away from our room . In the evening , we went to a happy hour in the lounge with the drink token ##s that were given to us at check - in . The entire staff at the Ki ##nz ##ie was extremely friendly and helpful . The location was central to all shopping and restaurants . I won ' t stay anywhere else when coming to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I really loved our experience at the Kim ##pton . We were delighted about the compliment ##ary happy hour and loved the lounge atmosphere . The room and bathroom though a little small had a very nice large t ##v and super com ##fy beds . I didn ' t particularly like the bathroom French doors which were a bit awkward . The closet even holds a nice yoga mat but I can see difficulty in doing yoga in such a small room ! The fitness facility was excellent but unfortunately we didn ' t have any time to use it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel and setting with a helpful staff . The rooms are a bit on the small side , but are well done . My favorite part was the Pro ##se ##cco Happy Hour ( how fun ! ) . We traveled for a meeting within the block at the Thompson building , which was very convenient . The location was just a few block ' s walk to the Chicago River . The Cadillac Palace Theatre is next door , so very convenient for that . The bed was comfortable and we had a nice and uneven ##t ##ful stay . En ##joy ##ed using the v ##alet parking option . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the overall experience was good . I suggest to reduce the cost of the parking . And add more kinds of food in the agency club . I also recommend that to has some activities for the kids . I also would like to add more advantages for your members . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed this hotel but a few things we did not like . There is no W ##i ##F ##i at all , room was very small , bathroom was extremely small , great water pressure and shower te ##mp was hot , sink water pressure hot , face ##t too close to sink to wash hands , need better shower curtain to not wet floor , need to re ##nova ##te the wall ##paper , and up ##hol ##ster ##y on bed , need to clean / wash carpet . Walls were thin . Could hear the people next door . Due to CO ##VI ##D restrictions , we were able to text the front desk and get fresh towels . Also they had a really N ##IC ##E Pro ##se ##cco Hour . Lo ##bby was depicted as pictured as well as the entrance . Star ##bu ##cks is located next door for a quick coffee pick up . Overall stay was good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 5 nights and enjoyed the welcome and service . The room we had was on the 29th Floor with a lake view and had plenty of space . One small moan would be about the size of the safe . . . . very small could do with up ##dating to a number coded one . the meal in the steak ##house was good . We found the con ##cier ##ge desk always helpful during our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone was extremely nice . Room was clean and comfortable . Check ##out was sea ##m ##less . The property is beautiful in most places . While the carpet in the hallway ##s is in ##dic ##itive of the original in the Tower , it looks s ##hab ##by and should be re ##con ##side ##red . Thank you for a great stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I spent a night in this hotel to celebrate my baby ’ s first birthday . People were so nice and polite , they even gave a present to my little one ! Everything was settle perfectly to avoid CO ##VI ##D infection , and they did a great job with breakfast , keeping it delicious even though it was to go . I would totally recommend it and hope to visit again soon ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Palmer Hotel by Hilton for one night on October 25 , 2019 . I was very impressed with the high quality of customer service provided by the hotel . I loved everything about my stay and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago . The location is perfect ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wasn ' t really sure what to expect . Really glad I picked Hotel All ##egro . Very convenient ##ly located near all the theaters . Easy access to bus stop , Di ##v ##vy bikes , and walk ##able to most everywhere . Con ##cier ##ge answered all our questions and gave great recommendations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located in heart of some of the best shopping and restaurants in the city ! Our son decided to join us last minute and the hotel upgraded us to larger room the day we checked in . I also left one sand ##al and con ##cier ##ge called back with in 10 minutes and said it would be in the mail the next am ( no ch ##g ) We had a delicious breakfast at hotel and enjoyed our outside table . The room was newly re ##mo ##del ##ed and very comfortable . We visit family frequently in the city and will definitely return to the Talbot ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pect ##ac ##ular architecture , very good food and service . Great location with lots to do . Room ##s are a little small ##ish but it ’ s an older hotel . Clean ##liness very good . Staff re ##sp ##ons ##ive . The exception ? The beds are rather uncomfortable and rather hard , but not in a good way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was in the perfect location for downtown Chicago . The room was clean and large enough for our family of 5 . The check in and check out process was so easy - just a click on my cell phone . The kids were greeted with good ##y bags . The staff was very friendly . We would stay at the O ##m ##ni again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , clean , staff very friendly and helpful . Short walk to shopping . Room had a great shower , bed was awesome . Bart ##ender was great service quick , had the pork slide ##rs , fantastic . There is a hotel history tour Friday ##s , I wish we could have done , 14th floor was a speakers back in the day . It was also old Playboy club so I ' m sure the tour would be cool . Wish W ##i - Fi was free . Will visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t is a lovely hotel in a great part of Chicago . It ' s a little off the beaten path , on a one way street , making it less ha ##rried and noisy than others . It is tucked into a wonderful part of Chicago and accessible to shops and restaurants . The staff is welcoming and helpful without being in ##tr ##usive . It ' s a great find . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay was very enjoyable . Room was very spacious and had all the ne ##cess ##ities that were needed . Only downfall was trying to use the digital key . If that could be fixed , the stay would have been perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really good for families and great staff and services . Pool was really good , breakfast was high quality , rooms were clean . Staff was really helpful with travel needs . We arrived early and the staff let us store luggage , they called when the room was ready , so we went out and about and then came back to a nice freshly cleaned room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thanks Travis and Dan for your warm welcome and help with all of our questions / concerns . Made our trip stress - free ! ! Great location , walk ##able to shopping and eating or a short U ##ber ride . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a trip for a group of 8 people . Bus ##y time of year and the hotel staff was spot on perfect . The set up was easy and well organized . We all had a good time and I will be going back to this location in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Fair ##mont hotel for a business trip . The location was superb . It ’ s 5 - 7 min ##s walk to Millennium Park and the River Walk , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile so on . The room is spacious , nice and clean . Love the s ##ham ##po ##o and lot ##ion . I arrived early and the front desk was able to let me Check - In early . Be careful , the hotel do charge $ 20 per day for their mandatory resort fees , whether you use any of the services and amenities during your stay . I ’ m most likely won ’ t stay here again due to this fees . There are other hotels around the area that are just as nice or nice ##r . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ing in took about 10 minutes . Process was a little longer with employee than normal . Nice facility , great location for walking to shopping , restaurants , and parks . Security in hotel was available . G ##rab and go restaurant was convenient with good choices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For sights ##ee ##ing , the location can not be beaten . Pretty much all major attractions in the city at walking distance . Nice and spacious rooms and a famous and historical indoor pool . The AC could be updated , it is very noisy . All in all , a great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had an exceptional experience with Do ##y E Gil ##dar ##t , Jr . , Hilton Grand V ##aca ##tions Representative . Do ##y assisted me with booking a Las Vegas vacation . He was very pleasant , paid attention to what I want / where I want to travel , and offered very helpful recommendations . He explained everything to me , and asked if I had questions to ensure I knew what I was signing up for . If you ’ re in the market for a grand vacation , contact him via Facebook ( Do ##y Edward Gil ##dar ##t Jr ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Price ##line chose this place for us and honestly I wish I would ##ve gone with my original choice . The price was only a couple dollars cheaper than the hotels that had pools and j ##ac ##uz ##zi ##s and water , coffee and tea that we didn ' t have to pay for . Vale ##t was 70 $ for one night . . j ##ee ##z . . . the bed was incredibly uncomfortable . There was no option for late check out . It just was very basic and for 10 / 20 $ more we could ##ve stayed in a better place . The bathroom was nice , that ' s about it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are shopping or sight seeing . . This is a perfect location to stay at . . The hotel is also extremely nice with all suites with 2 rooms . . . . Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tor in each room and 2 very large TV ' s . . . Large bathroom and excellent bed . There is a bar and restaurant but you can also walk to some of the best in the city from this location as well . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is dated , room shows signs of wear and security for room was compromised with door - handle hanging from door ! Phone in room does not work so cannot reach anyone for service . Restaurant eggs were ' hotel eggs ' . . . not so good . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were truly impressed with this hotel . The service was outstanding , the room was very comfortable , and the location is perfect . The per ##ks we received were very unexpected but greatly appreciated , they made our stay even more memorable . We often visit Chicago and have finally found our home away from home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first stay at a Kim ##pton Hotel . I now understand all the h ##ype , and truly enjoyed my stay . This historic property is charming . The staff is te ##rri ##fic . The free coffee set - up was perfect . The restaurants were a pleasant surprise . My room was just right for one person on a business trip . It may have been a little tight for two people - particularly the bathroom , which is small but functional . Lots of great amenities . Strong recommendation here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was attending a conference across town and was getting depressed in a rather ' past its prime ' hotel when I saw a mention of the Talbot ##t . I checked their site , and the rate for a studio type room was $ 14 more than the de ##pressing place I was in - took me about 15 minutes to check out and move . From the minute you arrive , the Talbot ##t is both welcoming and comfortable . Every single staff member greeted me with a smile and the room itself was perfect - king size bed , gigantic TV with super - easy controls , great living area space , and Jonathan Adler products , to boot ! The Talbot ##t is in a perfect location for restaurants , theater , and shopping . I have found my go - to hotel in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here 4 nights for the Chicago marathon and had a view of the river . It is close to downtown and the park and very easy to get about . It is also only 10 minute walk from the L . The staff are friendly and helpful with restaurants and star ##bu ##cks in the basement level . We had a fantastic twin double bed which were super com ##fy and easy to adjust the temperature of the room . We had a suite as well that had a huge lounge as well ! I think the only thing to remark was the bathroom and some of the fitting ##s do look a bit dated . However do not let this put you off ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location and view were excellent . However , the re ##mo ##vable area of the toilet seat was filthy . It was the same for both rooms I stayed in . Had to change rooms due to noise from the next room . The staff was great . The hotel even did a security check which impressed me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So ##phi ##stic ##ated contemporary accommodation ##s . Suite ##s provide extra space and are totally worth the upgrade . Floor to ceiling windows with automatic d ##rap ##es was a very plus ##h touch . Walking distance to all the best shopping in the city . Door ##man gave his local breakfast re ##come ##nd , Sunny ##side up Cafe , which was amazing . We needed g ##lut ##en free options , so this was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived to check ##in seeing a prominent sign that vehicles over 6 ' 1 " could not park in the garage . That ' s not an unusual size today so that should be noted prominently on the website . The person checking us in acted like they had never run into this issue before , and at first tried to get me to try and find street parking even though my rate included parking . After push ##back he let me leave my truck parked in the check ##in area . By morning there were two more trucks parked out there , so this must be a common issue and should be addressed . Also - the website indicated v ##alet parking was included with the rate but this location no longer offers v ##alet parking , that should be updated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a really nice three days in this hotel . The staff here are extremely helpful and friendly from the moment you arrive . I was a little early and they still managed to check me in as the room was available . Li ##fts are really fast ! The room was really comfortable and well presented and clean . The restaurant downstairs serves really nice food . The only negative ##s I had were that there were no coffee making facilities in the room and the gym was a little small and old . But I would highly recommend this place without any doubt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel with friendly and court ##eous staff , clean rooms , and an excellent location . Restaurant ##s with in walking distance , and so is the Navy Pier . When we go back to Chicago we plan on staying at So ##fit ##el Ma ##g Mile again . A ##wes ##ome stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel . Room was well maintained and great for a long weekend for 2 . The hotel is kind of off the beaten path but close to most things near millennium park and Michigan Ave . We walked to just about everything and if went out of the loop area , the L station was only a few blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , nice rooms and the staff felt like old friends or family members - very pleasant , helpful and knowledge ##able of the city / facility . I really enjoyed myself and will definitely book again next time I ' m in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over ##look ##ing the El ##eva ##ted street car , it is noisy , with tiny bathroom ##s and no room service . Restaurant is over ##p ##rice ##d and very me ##dio ##cre . Having a few funk ##y pillows in the room and a communal table at the bar does not make a bout ##ique hotel Poor ##ly staffed I would stay away [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the hotel I usually stay at when wanting to spend the night in the city . The rates are very reasonable considering the prices of rooms in the city . Most don ' t offer the charm and am ##bian ##ce , location , free cocktail hour and great rates . It is an older hotel but the de ##cor is trend ##y and fun ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] spent two nights in this great hotel perfect location for all the sights and great view from 23 floor . breakfast was lovely so was the service even looked after our bags after we checked out to do last minute sights ##ee ##ing [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very beautiful hotel in downtown Chicago Close to everything . The con ##cier ##ge was very helpful in setting us up for a wonderful dinner at the last minute . Bed was very comfortable . The room was very clean though a bit small . Typical for a old building . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well situated . Ma ##g mile adjacent and close to Navy Pier . Breakfast in hotel restaurant better than average but would have liked a real coffee bar . Next time I would probably stay near millennium park and art galleries . However nothing bad to say and very close to high end shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you want to be treated like you are ins ##ign ##ificant and the hotel ’ s financial gain is above yours , by all means try this hotel . I hope you don ’ t lose your room due to a “ g ##lit ##ch ” after waiting 10 ##hou ##rs , the v ##alet doesn ’ t lose your car and finally found it 40 ##min later , night manager doesn ’ t shove a key into your hands and tell you to take it and no we are not going to com ##p you for our g ##lit ##ch , and really hope the 24 / 7 con ##cier ##ge doesn ’ t ignore your multiple requests until they finally respond a day late , and really hope that they don ’ t lie to Hilton about already addressed your multiple complaints when they didn ’ t . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nice and clean hotel with pretty large rooms . Nothing to complain about but nothing really up ##lifting to write about either . Good staff cleaning by the book nice price and yes I would not mind staying here again [SEP]
0	[CLS] Right in the heart of Chicago . The staff was excellent at check in and whatever we needed . Sunday morning B ##runch was a little under ##sta ##ffed , but still enjoyable . I would plan on staying at the Conrad sometime soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed in Shu ##la St ##eak House . The music was loud and uncomfortable for a restaurant at 6 ##pm . Had to leave before ordering because of the volume .

1	[CLS] The hotel is located right near The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and only a few blocks from the water . The staff was very friendly , the price was reasonable , and they had a nice restaurant with good food . The room was clean but definitely lacking the style of a bout ##ique hotel . They had two elevators and one was broke so it was really time consuming trying to get an elevator and they definitely need to get that fixed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great location , friendly staff , especially le ##ah the front desk lady who upgraded our stay in k ##im ##pt ##om hotel all ##egro . Vic ##ini ##ty was clean and very comfortable . convenient rooms , and shopping option are p ##lent ##iful . [SEP]

1	[CLS] We have always wanted to stay here , but usually stay at the London house . This year we stayed at both . I ’ m so happy we stayed here . If your a clean freak , you ’ ll love it here . I loved the spacious room . A double queen gave our f ##am of 4 plenty of space , and the teens love the private window box to sleep in . The location is perfect , right on the river and just a few block walk to ma ##g mile . Hands down the friend ##liest staff in the city . This is my new go - to hotel choice . Thanks for awesome service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt was an awesome experience for my family . The New Years Eve celebration was exciting , lively and full of positive v ##ibes . The front desk staff is trying to anti ##ci ##pate your needs before you get there and have great customer service skills . They even added additional security NY ##E so the guests wore wrist ##band ##s and they had check ##points . The breakfast b ##uff ##et was heavenly and wide variety for all 6 of us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is perfect , walking distance to so many things . The staff was all very sweet to me , genuinely happy working there .

My room was be ##au ##iful and so comfortable , the bath tub was an amazing addition . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very well placed , walking distance to every good spot in the city , from city tours to the navy Pier . The service is very disc ##reet . Nothing particularly special , apart the excellent con ##cier ##ge services ( V ##erne and O ##s ##val ##do will tip you on everything with a smile ) , smooth sailing otherwise . Very good breakfast . The room was nice although expecting a bit more for a magnificent . Unless you get the 32 floor which has great view on the Lake and on the John Hancock tower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a perfect big city hotel with all the amenities . We enjoyed the suggestions from the con ##cier ##ge staff . They made some sight seeing reservations for us . Their restaurant suggestions were spot on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room next to elevator and I couldn ' t sleep not to mention they didn ' t have the NBA finals game 2 . . . in their bar but they had 25 TV ##s . Although it was during Co ##vid - 19 the hotel was not very busy and therefore the problems I faced were very fix ##able . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Intercontinental Chicago is a beautiful and convenient place to stay . Te ##rri ##fic for business and pleasure !

I highly recommend . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived on Tuesday evening very tired after flight from Heath ##row . Joshua on reception made us feel very welcomed and eased us through booking in and to our wonderful room with a fantastic view across the lake .

Can ' t thank the staff enough for their first class service and a great room in a great hotel . [SEP]

Standard room was comfortable ; great bed , k ##eur ##ig coffee maker in room ; large flat screen ; mini bar . Would definitely stay here again . Great value and great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice , historic hotel . Usually that means small rooms , but was pleasant ##ly surprised by how large the rooms were . Bath ##rooms were very small , but was clean and everything works . Only complaint is that with our room facing Michigan Ave , the road noise was very loud , and traffic starts at 5 ##am so it was bother ##some . Service was very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for anyone that rides the South shoreline train . The hotel is right next to Millennium Park , 1 - 2 blocks from S . Michigan Ave . and the river . Friendly staff , the hotel was clean and the beds and view from the room is beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this hotel for my trip to Chicago for Lo ##lla though Hot ##wire . The price was right , and the rooms were very nice , clean and quiet . The location was right of the Ma ##g Mile which made it very convenient for our time out to Grant Park . The parking was a bit price ##y - $ 75 / night but you can call the front desk and they will direct you to a cheaper parking garage . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for my bachelor ##ette party and it was such a great idea ! We got a room with a couch and we didn ’ t realize it would be a pull ##out coach and basically the size of a studio apartment . It was so worth the money ! We ended up parking in the garage around the block and it was cheaper than v ##alet at the hotel . The staff was great , very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They even brought a yoga mat to us in the morning ! Would stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wasn ’ t expecting much as I got a deal on travel ##zo ##o for $ 120 / ni ##te 2 double beds .

1	[CLS] We had a one night stay at Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago , and received S ##UC ##H great customer service from Ke ##enan . He hooked us up with a better room , to keep us from waking up to construction noises . Thanks Ke ##enan ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] PR ##OS : Things got much better when we switched from our original room . Our original was dark and very dated . We switched to a room on a higher floor with great views of the city . Had stayed here some 25 years ago , and had some fond memories of the hotel . Great location . Amazing pool . Wonderful location . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed in a spacious room and bathroom . CO ##NS : It ’ s a big hotel , not something we normally look for . Room ##s lack character , no charm at all - a little dated and run down . Very imp ##erson ##al service . Focus ##ed on a business client ##ele . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Just spent a cold weekend in Chicago . The Conrad was very co ##zy . Love ##d our room with a very comfortable bed and 65 inch TV . We took advantage of the on site bar and restaurant as well as nearby establishments to avoid the cold . We enjoyed all of them . Try the Sunday br ##unch at O ##ster ##ia Via St ##ato 2 blocks away . You won ' t be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Right on Michigan Avenue Ma ##gni ##fica ##nt Miles , 100 yards from Chicago river , this property was perfectly located . Good sized room , fitness center and pool all added to the attractive ##ness of the place . Michael Jordan ' s St ##eak ##house at the ground level is another plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was a mixed bag for me . When I select a hotel , I care about location . This hotel is perfectly located and so very walk ##able . I care about comfort . The rooms in the hotel as clean , but rather dated . Some are incredibly tiny . Our corner room was room , quiet , clean and the bed was very com ##fy . The bathroom was small , and the hot water and water pressure were disappointing . I care about service . Genesis at check in was super helpful . The housekeeper ##s were friendly . The door ##men were great . The bar tender ##s were te ##rse , but pro ##ficient . I care about clean ##liness . Our room was clean , but the rest of the hotel felt dusty . There was always trash by the elevator . This place was at one time grand . Now it just feels a bit sad . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent a 4 days Father / Daughter trip at the So ##fit ##el and we both enjoyed the So ##fit ##el and and Chicago . the location is great to see the city and many places are very near and of interest . The con ##cier ##ge service is extremely helpful and has good suggestions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful and helpful staff . Great location and room selection accommodate ##d were great for a ladies weekend in Chicago . The room does not include a mini fridge for personal use only for purchasing mini items . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton of Chicago is an excellent place to stay when visiting this city . The service was outstanding from check - in to house keeping . It is a beautiful Hotel with outstanding location to Grant Park and the museums . The park is across the street and the Field Museum and Sol ##ders Field is within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Yeah , it ’ s in a good location with clean reasonably sized rooms . But the breakfast is app ##all ##ing . It ’ s a help yourself b ##uff ##et with very limited options which you eat in foam bowls and paper plates using plastic cut ##ler ##y . Selection is limited to don ##uts , m ##uff ##ins rolls and a yo ##gu ##rt . There were a few sick looking boiled eggs floating in water and a large bowl of mixed cereal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the So ##fit ##el for 4 nights while in town for a Cubs game . Would definitely recommend this hotel - location is great and rooms are spot ##less . Nice bar and restaurant on - site as well - always a nice bonus ! Staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 3 nights . Every room chair had badly ripped and torn fabric . Bed frame was a piece of furniture , with exposed padded sides , worn , ripped and torn , the bed and box frame didn ' t fit . The toilet looked pretty industrial locker room ' is ##h . Climate control didn ' t work , at all . I spoke to the hotel , they said they were aware , nothing they could do . It was so warm in the room I got up 2 nights in a row and showered again to get cool enough to rest . Common areas were fine . Staff , other than the room issue , were 5 star . Ex ##pen ##sive place . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything was excellent . The rooms were nice , clean , and very spacious . All of the employees were very friendly .

Our room had window seats overlooking the river and Trump Tower - so much fun to curl up and enjoy the city view . Co ##zy robes completed the amenities we enjoyed - not your standard white , but a fun tiger stripe ! We did not request a pet gold ##fish or yoga mat ##s for our stay , but those were available as well as a bike that could be borrowed to r ##oam the city . [SEP]

1	[CLS] It ’ s a bout ##ique hotel in the theater district . Fair ##ly quiet . The lobby staff members were nice . The rooms are older so it feels like a 3 - star hotel . The bathroom was clean but there were a few pet hairs on the sheets when I pulled the blanket back , so I had to request fresh bed ##ding . One recommendation for management is to design ##ate certain rooms or floors for pets . Pet hair , odor , all ##er ##gens . . . please consider guests who may not be comfortable sleeping where pets have slept . I have no other complaints . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a wonderful stay ##cation with my boyfriend at the So ##fit ##el Chicago this past February . The location is incredible - you ' re walking distance to some of the best shopping and restaurants the city has to offer .

I ' ll be returning late April to stay for my birthday weekend and cannot wait to be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Above and beyond great customer service by Du ##f ##rel ##e . My family needed to change our reservation and he did an amazing job a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting our needs .

1	[CLS] For the price of this hotel , I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the rooms . The leather furniture in our rooms was very cracked ( to the point where the cracked leather on the chair would have ripped my dress ) , and the box springs on the beds had visible black marks on them . The lobby and attached bar / restaurant was beautiful however . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you want to step back in time where op ##ule ##nce was so extra ##va ##gant . . . don ’ t wait ! ! The Palmer House Hilton is a beautiful hotel .

I ’ m so thankful that Hilton has invested in this truly historical hotel . Our stay was perfect [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was my first time in Chicago and i loved it . : ) From the moment u ##ber took us to the Hotel and we were approached by Rufus . He was super , warm welcome . The following day was my Birth Day , this was the reason of my trip . in the afternoon i went to the Bell / Con ##cier ##ge Des ##k and approached Rufus to let us know where to have lunch . He introduced us to Robert , one more big asset in your Hotel . I told him that it was my birthday the following day He felt emotional due to his de ##ceived Mom Birth Day being the same day . These two guys made us feel like a million dollar . . i hope the Hotel Manager gets to see this , he has excellent first impression guys . Rufus and Robert Thank you for making our vacation un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble . Dora [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel . However , it ' s night 1 of 6 and we are all up sick due to the overwhelming amount of marijuana coming into our room from the hallway / nearby rooms . This is our first vacation to ch ##ica ##go with a baby and we are app ##alle ##d . A no smoking policy should mean no smoking of any type . If they allow smoking of marijuana , it would be nice to put guest who are not here to smoke it / guests with children as far away from the smoke ##rs as possible . We are hoping nights 2 - 6 improve . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel . Nice location , walking distance to many sights . Great breakfast , but a bit price ##y . Had twin room with two bathroom ##s . Great gym and an indoor pool as well .

I ordered a Guinness at the bar and got some water ##ed down version which tasted awful . Stay Away ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Lo ##bby area of this hotel is clean and vibrant . Good restaurant with excellent service . I stayed in the West Tower .

0	[CLS] The staff here are without question dedicated to making experiences enjoyable and memorable . It ' s the details that make a difference and they devote all efforts to guest experience . The rooms are fantastic , the property is new , and the food is killer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good gym but lacks light , great rooms , full of light though , very nice to just stay in and work in your bath ##robe . Lo ##bby is just ok . Not much more to say . . . good location . They brought me al ##mond milk with room service and did not charge which was nice . Coffee in the room , always good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] staff was wonderful , helpful , friendly and recommended some great dining options . Room was wonderful and bathroom was large and shower was great . The hotel offered great value and location was excellent and very close to Oak Street beach where we were attending the A ##VP beach volleyball championships . The beds were very comfortable and clean . Only negative was lack of television channels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The arrival process was fantastic . I needed to check in early and that was not a problem . We had a small issue with the elevators , which we were able to resolve quickly . The stay was perfect . Staff was most helpful . End ##ed up checking out late , and again that was no problem . I never felt as if I were asking for anything extra . Nice job . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was quiet and in a wonderful neighborhood , the Gold Coast but we could walk to downtown . Our room was lovely and spacious . Hotel staff was very helpful in all respects . It wasn ' t too expensive . All told , a great place to stay when in Chicago . Only draw ##back was the lack of a restaurant but we heard they are going to restore the restaurant in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in the studio king which was the right size for us . It started with Mi ##lis ##ada at the front desk , who was cheerful and extremely helpful while we checked in . Right after we headed to Gene at con ##cier ##ge who gave us a recommendation for the boat tour . Mill ##isa ##da made us feel like we were important to her and the hotel . We had a couple of small hip ups to us and she took care of them right away because I ' m guessing they were big to her . We only ran across one employee that was not smiling or willing to help you at anytime . Great hotel and this was our 1st visit to Chicago and if we go back we will look to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a spontaneous Sunday evening in Chi town and got an un ##believable rate at this luxury hotel . I felt like I was in Paris ! Wonderful view , high end ( La ##n ##vin ) toilet ##ries . . . I didn ’ t want to leave ! Very , very nice [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 3 nights and were very disappointed for the price . Staff was average . Nobody asked if we needed help with luggage when we arrived . No one ever helped us retrieve a taxi . The second night we were awakened by someone entering our room . The front desk apparently made a key card for our room by mistake for another person staying there . Very scary experience . When we called down to front desk the man that answered sad no we didn ' t do that . Must have been house ##keeping coming in No we saw the family that was coming in ! W ##i Fi and t ##v was terrible ! Next time we will stay somewhere else and we will try to get the annual meeting changed to another site ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am an I ##H ##G S ##pire member and when I ##H ##G integrated the acquired Kim ##pton Hotel in 2018 , I decided to try one and this is my first Kim ##pton and I had a great experience . The room is large , very clean , well appointed and super comfortable . Everything is a notch higher than the usual I ##H ##G brands - even the bathroom am ##eni ##ty is of very high quality . The hotel is in a great location but can be a challenge for getting food in the evening , and it is very convenient for transportation . Blue Line station bound for the O ' Hare Airport is about 2 blocks away and it made catching my morning flight way easier than I expected . I would definitely come back again on my next business trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Short cab ride from the train station . Easy walk to Water Tower Place . Close to the river for boat and people watching . The M ##J bar and restaurant were very nice . Having Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel was handy . The Wine Happy Hour was fun as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in the nice ##st style of suite offered . The room was huge with great views because it was on a corner . Everything looked great , but unfortunately the furniture wasn ' t very comfortable . The bed was lump ##y . The s ##ty ##lish couch ##es were not great places to sit . All of the employees were very friendly helpful . The room service menu was impressive . The bar downstairs is nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are taste ##fully decorated and comfortable . I have stayed here before though , which is why I was initially unhappy with my room allocation ( very small ) an issue which was not easily resolved . This combined with a very loud carpet dry ##er ( so loud it almost drowned out the TV ) being left switched on in the room next mine , really left me feeling disappointed about a hotel I had previously very much enjoyed staying at . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is close to the lake and a few blocks from the London House and Trump tower . The elevators are cool with no room number buttons to push inside , they are active with floors chosen by the elevator . Was here for a business s ##ym ##po ##sium . The rooms are large and very up to date . Only draw ##back is it is off the beaten path . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hotel is very well situated close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . From entering the hotel to check ##out the experience was great . Very friendly and helpful staff , great rooms and all in all a fantastic stay to make our first Chicago visit very memorable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very worth the reasonable price . Cha ##rming de ##cor and very clean . The staff were very helpful and friendly . I had a personal incident , and the attendant was very g ##rac ##ious and kind in assisting me ; not something one experiences too often . I was thoroughly impressed . I had a delight ##ful time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wife and I visited this hotel and it was our first time staying there . Hotel seemed to be in good shape and the rooms were clean and well maintained . We stayed in 320 ##7 which was at the end of the hallway and had a bay window . Pro tip : Excellent breakfast sandwiches in the Columbus Ta ##ph ##ouse in the morning ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location . Front desk acceptable but not great . Not sufficient elevators for hotel size . Room size nice . Overall ok experience but small things like no s ##ham ##po ##o in bathroom annoying . For the price should have bee ##b better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect Location . Great St ##ets ##ons rest ##au ##ra ##ut in the hotel , as well as a big bar , and star ##bu ##cks . Walk around the corner to G ##ior ##dan ##nos pizza , steps to Michigan Ave , overlooked the river walk . We were able to walk to Navy Pier , Mill ##eni ##um Park , Fountain , Oak Street Beach via Michigan Ave shopping . It was comfortable , clean and friendly check in . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Thank you so much everything was perfect ! I enjoyed my stay after a very hard day at the Ch ##eese ##cake Factory . Everyone was polite , and so welcoming . Thank you for all that you do ! ! ! Keep up the good work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a two day conference . Quick overview : Room ##s were very nice Staff was all wonderful and very re ##sp ##ons ##ive Location - - great ! Con ##ven ##ient walking to many great sites View from our window was of Navy Pier and the lake ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly Service , clean efficient Hotel in the heart of Chicago . Easy access to the museums , shopping and theater district . The con ##cier ##ge is very available and has always arranged great restaurants and is able to assist in transportation , tours and even theater tickets . The on ##site bar and restaurant is excellent . The staff cannot do enough for the guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came to see all the Christmas decorations stores and lights Navy Pier , Zoo lights and Hancock building . We also saw some of the beautiful old downtown buildings including the R ##ook ##ery and the amazing Marquette Building . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family of 2 adults and 3 kids stayed over the weekend and had a wonderful visit . While the beds were only double , they were very comfortable and the “ roll ##away co ##t ” was actually a comfortable twin mattress on which my son slept very well . Any noise from other rooms was minimal so we slept great . The fitness room was really just a small gym and had a variety of quality equipment . Yes , the bathroom had the p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper and older shower fixtures but it didn ’ t really bother us as house ##keeping did a great job . The lobby was always hop ##ping and the check in was filled busy , so none of these things seem to bother others either . Staff was very friendly , we ’ ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at many Hilton properties this was top notch location and beautiful lobby . Good bar and service . Walking distance to theater . I like the location and will stay at the palm ##er house next time in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] I especially enjoy the view from my room , I was able to see the Festival of Lights Parade . Also , the bed was very comfortable , I slept like a baby ! I would recommend the H ##ya ##tt as a great place to stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location on the Miracle Mile of Michigan Avenue . Michael Jordan restaurant attached is excellent . People were all nice and helpful , taxi ##s always out front . Room was nicely appointed and everything clean and updated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , small feel with first class service and tons of style ! They have a suite that is perfect for family travel . The hotel has a great bar and wonderful food but if you just step right out the door , there are dozens of choices on surrounding blocks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here celebrating our anniversary and left very satisfied and thankful for our experience . We received a nice and warm greeting , easy check in , great bell service and con ##cier ##ge . The rooms were beautifully done and im ##ma ##culate . We enjoyed the wine from 5 - 6 , the coffee in the morning and the very friendly and at ##ten ##tive staff . The restaurant attached was also quite good . The location is perfect and very central . We would stay here again in a heartbeat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Apart from the convenient location there was nothing we liked about this hotel . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not 4 ##star ! No ##is ##y , tired ( especially the bathroom ) and basic . P ##ractical ##ly impossible to connect to the w ##i - fi . The Lock ##wood restaurant ceiling is beautiful so a visit for a drink would be sufficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a Saturday night at the Talbot ##t . The hotel had a great bout ##ique atmosphere and we had an excellent experience . The staff was very ho ##sp ##ita ##ble - - everyone we interact ##ed with was friendly and helpful . The room was clean and under ##state ##d . We had a slight issue with the room keys not working properly but the staff quickly resolved the problem ! The location offers easy access to great restaurants and shopping . We enjoyed our stay and would return again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had amazing experience with Noel today 25 ma ##r . he is court ##eous polite and perform good customer service we recommend that this person must be commended for the tremendous work and professional customer service Noel well done for amazing services Keep It up and more power [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a s ##wan ##ky cool hotel . Very nice room with lots of space and a large bathroom . I ordered room service which came quickly and was delicious . High ##ly recommend ! Looking forward to my next trip to Chicago so I can come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , comfortable room . Excellent location . We upgraded to a room with a city view and it was spectacular , but it cost us $ 15 a night ( our original room faced another building ) . I did feel that the hotel ni ##ckle and dim ##ed us for any extra ##s . We wanted a refrigerator for some left - overs from a restaurant and it was $ 25 . They won ' t let you put food in the mini bar and there are sensors inside so you get charged if you remove anything . They did have a nice convenience store downstairs where you could get food and Star ##bu ##cks coffee . Price ##s were reasonable and we appreciated its availability . Overall we liked the hotel but we certainly paid a lot for it . We were there during the Chicago marathon and they increased the prices , as usual . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was recommended by a client I was visiting . Staff were at ##ten ##tive , breakfast by the elevators on each floor was a great idea . A short walk to a number of very good restaurants and the river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Josh checked us in and was very good . The entire hotel was very clean ! Our corner room had views of the river , lake and the parks . TV was huge and modern . El ##eva ##tors were very fast . The fitness center was excellent . This hotel did not feel as ups ##cale as other hotels in this category . It seemed small . It was connected to the p ##ed ##way which was nice to stay out the weather . It was a short walk to the parks and Michigan Ave . Navy Pier was not far either . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic location across from Millennium Park with great views of Lake Michigan . The hotel was built in the early 1900 ’ s , is large , and historic . We stayed there as part of a wedding group as they had a special rate of $ 179 . Of course when we checked in , they offered us an upgrade to a Lake view room for an extra $ 50 per night . We took it and had a fantastic corner room on the 17th floor with outstanding views . Only thing I found odd was the $ 3 per bag charge to check a bag for temporary storage - especially since they just stuck it in an open room off the lobby where the attendant sat . Not sure if we ' d stay there without the special group rate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is absolutely beautiful and the building is full of history . However , they could put some more care into their rooms . The bathroom , in particular , was out ##dated and could have been cleaner . Also the shower curtain was a mesh material the wasn ' t imp ##er ##me ##able to water , so the bathroom floor flooded whenever I took a shower . There is no free w ##if ##i , no refrigerator , no coffee maker , and no microwave in the room . The mini ##bar is reserved for the items placed in there by the hotel and has a sensor that charges you if anything is disturbed . The TV reception was horrible - the TV constantly went in and out or didn ' t work at all . Also be aware that the hotel is adjacent to the L - train , which runs all night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel several times - most recently on February 24 . Up ##graded to suite with certificates . This is an excellent hotel , typical of Fair ##mont and we had nice view . T ##the front desk was very helpful with late ( same - day ) change to date of my reservation , which they likely did not have to accommodate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel well located . Great breakfast b ##uff ##et ( $ 25 ) . Large room but poor use of space . Large desk where they should have chairs and a table . Hard to use room with 2 adults and two older kids . Need ##s micro and non stock ##ed fridge one more family friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s and furnishings were clean , spacious and comfortable . The compliment ##ary breakfast and evening Social were expert ##ly provided and delicious ! Beautiful views from the top floor pool and fitness center aided our enjoyment . Just a few blocks from the River ##walk and even closer to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , staff , services were all top notch . A small g ##lit ##ch with a room was taken care of immediately . We have been here before and were impressed again . The social hour is a great plus . The price for the location was a bargain . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay ! This is the only time we ' ve stayed at a Chicago hotel twice , as we like to experience different hotels . Our first stay in July was so good , we decided to stay here again in late November . Drake and the entire front desk staff were great ! We needed di ##st ##ille ##d water for a c ##pa ##p device . The hotel didn ' t have it , but they went out and got it for us and brought it directly to the room . We will be staying here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Happy with the room , view , clean ##iness , and front desk service . Great area to walk to waterfront within minutes and down the river walk - see picture . Food $ $ in hotel . There is a Star ##bu ##cks . One note - Over ##night parking is $ 55 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Man ##dan ##a in the Gold Lounge was O ##UT ##ST ##AN ##DI ##NG ! Great customer experience ! She was friendly , kind , helpful , & most of all , made us feel like we were guests in her home ! Thank you Man ##dan ##a ! I forgot to put my smile card in the “ Smile Contest B ##ic ” for you so I hope your General Manager can give you two votes during our stay , one for me & one for my husband ! You are te ##rri ##fic ! Thank you for your warm hospitality ! : - ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Swiss ##ô ##tel for the second time on a trip to Chicago . The staff here is amazing . . they make you feel welcome and are helpful in every way . The views from the room are gorgeous . . beautiful lake and river pan ##ora ##mic pictures in every direction . Room ##s are very comfortable and attention to detail makes you feel like a special guest . The location is great . . you can walk to many restaurants and take the Red Line to W ##rig ##ley . We love the Swiss ##ô ##tel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First visit to M . K . and I was not disappointed . Close to the Ma ##g Mile and walking distance to many great restaurants and other attractions . The check in process was easy and they happen ##d to have our room ready for early check in . Everyone there was very pleasant and a ##cco ##mo ##dating . While the room wasn ' t huge , it was comfortable , clean and met all of my needs . P ##lent ##y of storage and counter spaces . I personally did not experience any issues with the three elevators and didn ' t have to wait long for service . The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas and they even had c ##ider , co ##coa and cookies for their guests one evening . I would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We traveled with our 3 boys to this hotel . We had great service from the staff . Guillermo ( ? ) Who helped with the social offered to make my children something special when he overheard they didn ' t like the food . I told him no , but it was kind of him to offer . The room was quiet ( except for some street traffic ) and clean . The front desk was great with food suggestions and directions . The location was great as we could walk to the red line or just walk to so many things close by . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni was a perfect hotel for our family to stay at . Court ##eous staff , large rooms , great food , and located in the middle of it all ! We walked to Oak Beach and down to the ma ##rina and millennium Park . You have to stay here if your heading to the Wind ##y City ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a te ##rri ##fic hotel . This was my second stay , and I ’ d stay again . The rooms are spacious , attractive and comfortable . The bathroom ##s are the best I ’ ve encountered . The staff are friendly . The location is great . The only thing that de ##tracts is that the lobby - level restaurant and bar is lack ##luster and not up to the standard I ’ d expect in a hotel that is so otherwise excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have a great experience conference room Great rooms are clean every day The only thing I didn ’ t like shower ##s no pressure and water other than that everything ’ s fine location of the hotel for Chicago is perfect view from the window Was nice thank you H ##ya ##tt [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful 3 night stay at this Hotel . The location was within walking distance of Michigan Ave and State St . Also close to river walk . All the restaurants that were recommended were within walking distance . The hotel featured compliment ##ary breakfast and cocktail happy hour . All bed ##ding and de ##cor in our room was excellent . High ##ly recommend [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had gone to the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel this past weekend because there was a wedding there . I loved the customer service . As soon as I arrived the bell ##man Alfredo greeted me so nicely and I automatically felt welcomed . It was a nice experience receiving that kind of assistance . I would definitely go back to the Ki ##nz ##ie ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This place was awesome ! Staff was friendly , we definitely recommend this place . They accommodate ##d our family to the best of their ability . Everything was excellent I loved the view but I only wish we had more coffee cream ##er . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed over night as Hilton / honors member . Room was fine , price was right and we were generally pleased . However @ 9 : 12 a . m . someone from house ##keeping knocked on the door and when we didn ’ t answer it within 10 seconds she unlocked the door and came in . ( My wife was still sleeping and I was sitting in the chair . ) . The lady apologized and said she “ had to do it . ” Pre ##su ##ma ##bly their policy is to get people up and out of their room as ##ap so they can clean it for the next guest ? I called and spoke with the manager ( Rose ##mar ##ie ) who said she ’ d have the house ##keeping manager call me to explain their policy . Of course I never re ##c ’ d such a call . So much for making sure the guests are satisfied . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the first time I have stayed at The Ambassador . I had a Jr . Suite which was nice , two rooms separated by a curtain . The room was clean and comfortable . One the down ##side , there was no coffee pot or fridge in my room so I had to go out and get coffee or water on a daily basis . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location but generic room for bout ##ique prices . Fe ##lt no different than a Holiday Inn Express or Hampton Inn . The room lacked any kind of character of a bout ##ique hotel . Room was clean enough but not spot ##less . Staff was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There is no refrigerator , no microwave , fl ##aking paint in the bathroom . Park ##ing pass with Q ##R code does not work . No way to contact the on ##site bar / restaurant because the do NO ##T H ##AV ##E A P ##H ##ON ##E . Way over ##p ##rice ##d considering all of the above . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved at the hotel and was immediately welcome at the Front Des ##k as a S ##pire member , asked about my journey that day and was there anything special I needed . After that the check in process was quickly executed and I was on my way to the room . The room , and most probably others , was well appointed with furniture and all other amenities . A visit to the M ##J Bar ~ G ##rill followed and although pretty packed ( Friday evening ) the Wait ##sta ##ff found me a table and I was soon part ##aking of a glass of wine and in ##du ##l ##ging in several app ##eti ##zers . Next day , thanks to the Con ##cier ##ge , I was on my way to a walking tour . Great staff , highly professional , gave visibility to each guest from what I experienced . If you are in Chicago this hotel is highly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is amazing . Staff are so friendly and the rooms spacious and spot ##less . The view from the top floors is spectacular but the best part is the sheer luxury of the bed , bathroom and extra touches . We spent three nights there whilst exploring Chicago before heading off on Route 66 . A grand start to our trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] To be fair , the quality of sleep was superb . It is just a shame that the service is not that of similarly priced She ##rato ##n hotels . If you have been to the European branches , the hotel just doesn ’ t offer the same personal ##ised welcome upon check - in , and for the price , at least a fake emotion is better than nothing . Also , the room upgrades are great for the higher floors , which helps to lower the street noise . But that is it ; although the executive lounge is large and has great views of Chicago , it is very poorly maintained and badly cleaned after guests ( although the hotel cleaning staff do try their very best and are friendly towards guests ) . I think these issues could be addressed by better management and setting higher standards . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An absolutely amazing location in an architectural ##ly interesting building ! The staff is imp ##ec ##ca ##bly trained and welcoming . Top marks for the people element ! Bath ##rooms are large and spacious with amenities you expect at a Star ##wood hotel . I thought the red carpet / muted colors were an interesting choice in terms of interior design , though I ' m sure this is intentional . Will absolutely recommend and hope to stay again soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely the best gym in all of Chicago ##land hotels . Indoor pool , sa ##una , track ( yes , a track ) and every dumb ##bell / an ##ae ##ro ##bic piece of equipment you could possibly want . Oscar , who great ##s you at the sign in area is absolutely fantastic . His professional ##ism is only best ##ed by his memory ( remembered my name in - between three week stay ) . Equipment is well maintained , cleaned daily and new ( love the p ##elo ##tons ! ) . I choose Hilton Chicago for the gym over my next favorite the W ##it . Great work Oscar ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel nice good rooms with separate lounge we had club room which included breakfast only downfall was unless you are hilt ##on gold member or above only internet in foyer there is a couple of computers in club room [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived at the hotel after 2 flight changes and 2 flight delays and no baggage ! the con ##cier ##ge Sheila was absolutely brilliant in dealing with the airline and transport company to get our baggage ( it arrived 3 days later ) , she also is a wealth of knowledge about Chicago - the best places to eat and drink ( try the ribs at Carson ##s ) , a good place to catch a beer or two with very large food portions is the Emerald loop across the road ! make sure you ask Sheila about riding the ' L ' system ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in a " Superior K ##I ##ng " room . It was spacious , nicely appointed and well maintained and clean . The bathroom was marble and had ample counter space . The location is very good . It is at the end of the main shopping district , just off of Michigan Avenue . It is very convenient to the shops but just a bit north of the real congestion . It has an excellent bar with excellent bar tender ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second stay at the Talbot ##t . We like the quiet location . The rooms have been updated and are spacious for the city , also quite affordable compared to other hotels . Use Park ##w ##hi ##z to park nearby and avoid a pretty steep v ##alet bill . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t was a pleasant surprise . I ’ ve stayed in ch ##ica ##go many times over the years and at multiple hotels . I saw them ta ##l ##bot ##t on trip advisor and decided to try it . I would definitely return for a personal trip stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I left a valuable Chan ##el purse in the security box in our room . I had not realized this until I returned back to NYC . I called the Hilton Chicago and was connected to Michael who was understanding of the situation and did what he could to help me . His supervisor was able to successfully secure the purse , and I received a call from Michael who updated me and gave me further instructions with register ##ing the lost item on a platform that the Hilton uses . This all took about 15 minutes . I am in a service driven profession and am impressed with how this situation was handled . Michael was em ##path ##etic with my situation and did his best in a time ##ly fashion . Trust is something earned , and I am grateful to report such a great experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was pleasure to stay in So ##fit ##el . The size of room and comfort are excellent . The bed is perfect . Although I have a back problem , I was pain ##less . It is at the center near to walk almost everywhere if you like walking . If I go there , my choice will be again So ##fit ##el . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good hotel for business . Really excellent staff . Clean with wonderful beds and great bar . Well located near river and bus tours . Only mild criticism was that food could have been hotter . Would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay a lot , room was big , bathroom was enormous , N ##ess ##press ##o coffee in the room , huge closet ##s , clean , can ' t think of anything we ' d change . Great property and staff , easy access to bus to museums , within walking distance of main attractions . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend . Vale ##t parking a bit steep at $ 70 / night , but that ' s probably the norm downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] By far one of the best Hilton properties . The staff , architecture , am ##ent ##ities and location are outstanding . Any questions we had were answered promptly and with a smile . From the front desk to the con ##cier ##ge . . . Thank you [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in Chicago for work at the International Machine Too ##l Show ( I ##MT ##S 2018 ) . The company put us up at the Intercontinental . This is a great Hotel with plenty of places to eat or get a drink close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is amazing with very friendly and helpful staff . B ##uff ##et in the conference area was efficient and delicious . D ##O NO ##T eat at American Kitchen and Bar . . . . worst service ever . Me ##ssed up several of our meals , one took so long to remake most of us were done eating . Not friendly at all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A beautiful bout ##ique hotel in an ideal location steps away from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , high - end amenities and close to some of the best shopping and food in the city ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has amazing amenities , is located right in the middle of everything and the staff goes above and beyond . The rooms are incredibly clean , comfortable and spacious . My family will definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We noticed garbage on the floor and dust b ##un ##nies and co ##b ##we ##bs on the ceiling . This is in the Premier Corner Room , with a view . It is unfortunate that we have to write a review to bring this to light but after not ##ifying the front - desk we were kept waiting on the manager . We were told that the manager would see us , but we were kept waiting . We were told a final cleaning was done before check - in , but look at the photos . They prove otherwise . It is unfortunate that such an expensive room , during the CO ##VI ##D - 19 pan ##de ##mic , where environments need to be clean and sa ##ni ##tized , weren ' t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here many times . What makes it special ? Beauty , top notch service and " extra ##s . " Extra ##s ? Like a breakfast island surround by water in the lobby . And access to the Illinois Center next door : several stories of every con ##ce ##ivable sports equipment and courts . It is just a fun place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The property has gone down hill for years . The rooms are dirty , carpet is dirty and chairs are worn out . The walls need paint and new wall ##paper . Go there , have a drink , take a picture of the lobby and leave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was spot ##less , service was 1 - 1 at check - in and really friendly with a great sense of humor . Harry Carey ##s just on the other side of the street , perfect location ! Look ##ed like a brand new hotel ! Very modern and s ##ty ##lish . The map on the wall was so unique and historical to Chicago ! Love ##d having breakfast right on my floor so I didn ' t have to get changed before having a morning cup of coffee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t is the only hotel we stay at when we are in Chicago . This bout ##ique hotel has every am ##eni ##ty you could dream of , it is surrounded by numerous restaurants , shopping , night ##life , etc . . It is pet friendly , 2 blocks from a dog - friendly park . There is a bar and excellent restaurant in the lobby . And I ' ve saved the best for last - - the staff members are the friend ##liest , most a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting of AN ##Y hotel I ' ve experienced , and I stay at many around the country . A special shout - out to David and Charles , who are the i ##cing on the cake of the F ##abulous Talbot ##t ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing hotel with lots of facilities specially complementary breakfast and evening social . St ##uff members are great they deserve all the appreciation . Special ##ly the team who works at breakfast area and evening social ( dinner ) area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Just checked out of Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel , and I ' m already missing it ! The front desk staff is court ##eous , efficient , and problem solve ##rs and I appreciated them after a long journey to Chicago . The rooms are s ##ty ##lish , well stock ##ed with amenities , towels , and the pillows are divine ! This hotel is within walking distance to many eating venues , from the Public House next door to a Ruth ' s Chris or even Harry Cara ##y ' s . I ' m definitely going to add Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel to my stable of selected places to stay across the country . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is huge and so can be crowded , however it also has a classic old feel to it and does reflect the energy of a bust ##ling city like Chicago . The staff are very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting in a way that you would not expect in a hotel so large . The room does show it ' s age and does not necessarily have all the latest things like power plug ins for charging or an updated bathroom , however the room is unusually large for a city hotel and is very comfortable . The location is great . Near to the sites and shopping . The lobby is beautiful and still contains the ornate fixtures that were original to the building . We plan on returning back again and I would definitely recommend the hotel to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a former hotel executive , I am genuinely impressed with this property . I found this hotel to be a clean and co ##zy g ##em with great location next to the river . Staff is genuinely nice and not over re ##hea ##rse ##d par ##rots repeating the same lines . This usually happens when top management carefully picks the right staff and teaches common sense customer service . Like in most Kim ##pton properties , restaurants offer innovative and high quality food , will definitely stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is my go to hotel for all trips to Chicago . So ##fit ##el is a luxury US brand ( not always true in Europe ) that most travelers over ##look . Because of this you can often find bargain rates . This is a beautiful architectural treasure with wonderful rooms convenient to Michigan Avenue and most downtown locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent H ##ya ##tt . Great location although a little hard to find the parking area . views were great . there are a lot of excellent places to eat within walking distance . we would glad ##ly stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed into the room on a night with an outside te ##mp of 6 degrees . Room was 59 degrees . Despite c ##rank ##ing the heat , the room only reached 64 degrees by the next morning . Beautiful small bout ##ique hotel , but newer windows and ins ##ulation are needed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice location , big nice very clean room , no co ##ffe in rooms for people who likes their morning co ##ffe but will five u a good reason to get out of u ##r room and get it downstairs . I like their customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker in downtown Chicago in September . It had a great bar in the lobby that served great drinks . The rooms were very up to date with an excellent shower and bathroom . The rooms were a little small but completely adequate . The beds were super comfortable . The rest ##ura ##nt was great for breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay at the Palmer House . The lobby is beautiful and service in the hotel is outstanding . It ' s location is close to the theatre to see Hamilton , a 5 minute walk tops . The restaurant was very good before the theater and the server asked us if we were going to ensure pro ##mpt ##ness of our meals . Afterwards drinks and dessert was available and very relaxing in the lobby , which has such a great v ##ibe . Stay ##ing on the " executive level " 23rd floor was nice because of breakfast in the morning and snack ##s at dinner ##time were included . The afternoon / evening bar was cash but the rest was included . Our room was facing the lake and was very room ##y . Sure it could use a few touch ups but nothing terrible . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been to Chicago numerous times and quite honestly , I can ’ t give a bad review on any motel I have stayed in . It ’ s hard to even class ##ify them as ‘ motel ##s ’ , rather luxurious retreat ##s from the norm . Obviously , you ’ ll pay a little extra when you when you stay at a place like this , but it ’ s money that ’ s technically , not lost . The service and the feeling of security with staff that are always available in the entrance and curb ##side are comforting . I really dig this place ! Some people take issue with the logistics of the elevators , but it ’ s really not that big a deal . We walk miles in Chicago , so ten extra steps isn ’ t bad . This is a great place to land when you ’ re in town , would recommend to anyone ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Friendly staff , beautiful de ##cor in the middle of everything . The view from our room was AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! The Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby was also a nice touch . Will definitely be returning . Sorry to take so long to review . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a great weekend get ##away . This was an amazing hotel . The room that we got was so amazing with such a great view of the city and the also the lake ##view . We were treated so well with champagne and straw ##berries in our room for our anniversary . De ##fin ##ite ##ly going to use this hotel again in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is clean , quiet and the staff is friendly . It is convenient ##ly located just a block from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and all manner of restaurants and tourist ##y types of things . Most of things I do are within walking distance of the hotel , but U ##ber is easy to use from this location [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby here is on the 20th floor so the views from the bar there are great . We ate dinner here when we stayed and the wait staff was fun , the Am ##ish chicken was heavenly and the wine selection top notch . The only draw ##back of having the rooms below the lobby and being so close to the Mile , is that it was a little noisy and the window sound ##proof ##ing wasn ’ t as good as some places I ’ ve stayed , but overall really fun night ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Hotel and location . Quiet , classic and private . Great neighborhood and walking is easy . Excellent spot to stay for Cubs games as well . Perfect location to get out to W ##rig ##ley and not far at all . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great place to stay with a warm and friendly staff . Upon checking in to our room we were handed a welcome bag for our dog , which was especially consider ##ate and made our visit that much more enjoyable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our room , the lobby is a g ##em , the food is delicious , the staff throughout provide service as one would hope to have - - we just love staying at the Palmer House . The b ##uff ##et is pretty stunning and it is " fun " to re ##li ##ve and im ##mers ##e yourself in how things were for high - end travel in earlier times . I purchased a lovely leather travel bag at the well - appointed gift shop ##pe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions were incredibly nice , and Leah R . was excellent at reception ! We greatly enjoyed the stay and appreciated the close proximity to the Midway Airport CT ##A orange line train , which was just a couple of blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wow ! We had a family get together in Chicago and many of us stayed at the Ambassador Hotel . . . a favorite when it was The Public . Everything was on point ##e . . . rooms were great , compliment ##ary coffee , dogs welcome . . . perfect location , great restaurant and bar . everything under one roof ! The crown ##ing glory was R ##IC ##K at the front desk ! ! ! Great way to start your hotel stay with a guy who is hospitality person ##ified ! Friendly , professional , a ##cco ##mo ##dating . . just a great first impression guy . . . thanks R ##IC ##K for the conversation and coffee . . . you made our stay perfection [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a nice and memorable stay at P ##U ##BL ##IC - - a hotel of the people . The service was wonderful , the room was aesthetic ##ally plea ##sing , and the location was absolutely perfect . I look forward to staying at this incredible hotel again in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great hotel location and price . looked around for a while and this was best combination of price , location and rating ! room service was very good but p ##ric ##y . they offer parking at the hotel but for a very steep price . that seems to be the norm for Chicago hotels but you can find parking much cheaper a block or two away . ( that was my biggest issue with the hotel ) . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The location of the hotel is perfect for sights ##ee ##ing and visiting all the restaurants throughout Chicago . Everything was a short walk away or a quick five minute car ride when we didn ' t want to walk . R ##ubi ##e from the front desk is awesome ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this hotel to attend a conference meeting which was at the hotel . The price is more expensive than other hotels in the area . The room is big and the view of the river was awesome ! The staff is friendly and at ##ten ##tive . However , I paid for the breakfast package and it was confusing to everyone ( staff and me ) about how this works . Also , breakfast was from 8 - 11 and my conference started at 8 so I was unable to use the full package . Upon check out , I was charged for the breakfast ##s ( $ 100 . 91 for 3 breakfast ##s which did not include drinks ) and had to have these meals taken off my re ##ceipt which seemed to i ##rri ##tate the staff who checked me out . [SEP]
0	[CLS] There was absolutely nothing wrong with the service here . Everyone including the v ##alet was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I was disappointed in how run down the hotel was . I have stayed at Hotel Monaco in Phil ##ly and it was amazing . Hotel Monaco in Chicago , not so much . The pictures and description of the room is not even close to the room I was given . I will never stay here again . Please don ' t waste your $ 29 ##9 dollars here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have not stayed at the Ambassador since I was a child ! Need ##less to say it had changed a bit . I like the new v ##ibe . Mini ##mia ##list , to be sure . But some of the old ways l ##inger . . . free shoe shine for their guests . Fr ##ans ##isco did a spend ##id job on my old , ( in desperate need of a shine ) boots ! Thank you . Very quiet , com ##fy beds . There were some minor condition problems with the room , all in all I would return . Good deal ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First visit to this location , and it did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint in the least . Great location , wonderful service , and an over all beautiful hotel . Had a lake view room on the 20th floor , and you could not ask for better sea ##nery . Room was comfortable but on the small side but under ##stable considering its a historic old hotel . Breakfast was very good , opted to get the full b ##uff ##et . Over all a good experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had just finished r ##v holiday so needed a bit of luxury , certainly was luxury perfectly situated for walking into shops sights ##ee ##ing and buildings . B ##rill ##iant staff most helpful . Good prices and rooms are beautifully decorated . Beautiful 20 ' s style throughout . We would definitely recommend wishes could stay longer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful and court ##eous staff , great location , nice rooms . Would highly recommend this hotel . Next time I find myself in Chicago I will try to stay there . The only issue is that I have to put more characters for this review to be active . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister and I came to Chicago in February for a music gal ##a . We chose the So ##fit ##el because the rooms are very nicely appointed and the beds very comfortable . The hotel has a great restaurant and is very close to the Hancock building , shopping and restaurants . The hotel staff are kind and helpful . There is a lovely lobby sitting area as well as a great lounge . If you value clean ##liness , comfort and close proximity to the magnificent mile this hotel will not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] New location with new modern upgrades in room and excellent bar / restaurant and rooftop lounge night ##life . quiet ##er location off Michigan Ave . con ##cier ##ge and staff are excellent and know the area secrets well [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at this hotel has always been very nice and helpful . We got an update and the suite was outstanding , the room was very clean and spacious . I will definitely be booking more w ##k ##nd get ##away ##s at the H ##ya ##tt [SEP]
0	[CLS] After enjoying the wonders of this incredible city , it was perfect to come back to fine accommodation ##s and service from the superb So ##fit ##el . Sleeping on a cloud made it even better . Why settle for anything less - I don , t work for So ##fit ##el nor am compensate ##d for this review , just enjoy quality experiences . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about this experience was great . The suite was sweet . The room was bright and air ##y and the H ##VA ##C worked well . Bell service the fastest I have experienced in 50 years of hotel stays . Hotel personnel were all pleasant and competent . And , using a T ##RA ##VE ##L ##Z ##O ##O rate , the price was better than right . Location was right on Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile so it couldn ' t be beat . Alto ##get ##her , a great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time staying in the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . I was there for 5 days on business and it was an absolutely darling bout ##ique hotel . The hotel is located in an excellent location in Chicago , right next to the river and within walking distance of everything . There is a happy hour every night from 5 - 7 ##pm with unlimited wine and beer which is lovely . B ##UT the most lovely part is J ##OS ##H - I could spend the entire review just g ##loat ##ing on Josh alone ! What a great people person and a delight to be around . He really made our stay a blast . His recommendations of places to go were directly on point and our last day we joined him at Jeffrey ' s . We had the time of our life . Thanks Ki ##nz ##ie and thanks Josh for a great experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The convenient location by the river , close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile and with a great view from the city are the highlights . Hotel is also close to several restaurants . Room is comfortable with a great view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great trip to Chicago ( other than flight cancellation last Friday . The Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal is a very nice property in walking distance to many eating and entertainment opportunities . At all times I received excellent service beginning at check in and all the way through my stay . You have a very professional and court ##eous staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] check in staff and check out staff were rude , room was b ##ot available even at 5 pm and room I was given was not clean . Overall , not a great experience at this hotel and only stayed here as we had a conference at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ambassador for the night when going to see Pearl Jam . The service was outstanding and the hotel is beautiful ! From check in with Mel ##ika to ordering room service we could not have asked for a better experience ! We have stayed at many hotels and B & B ’ s in Chicago and this was the best place we have stayed to date . I highly recommend them for your next trip ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had wonderful anniversary visit ! The hotel was great and the staff were tremendous ! ! We recommend this hotel highly . They made our visit comfortable , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , pleasant and enjoyable ! The Intercontinental is our favorite ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are fine , bed comfortable and location is good . What makes this an excellent review is the gold level service . We got instant great responses and support from restaurant recommendations . They even provided us with band ##aid ##s and running shoes . The location is central , the elevator fast and overall a good choice in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a 31st floor room - lovely views and it was quiet . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . Excellent location . Service was good but not amazing - for example our room was always rest ##ock ##ed for one person even though there were 2 in the room . Perhaps they need more staff on during the busy times . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Staff members of the Palmer House are incredible . I ’ ve never met a more polite group of people . They made our stay in Chicago a memorable visit . Thank you ! If you ’ re staying in Chicago and aren ’ t lucky enough to stay at The Palmer House , be sure to walk th ##ru it . This is the most no ##stal ##gic . The de ##cor has been kept to the time period and absolutely stunning . If you ’ re one to require a large room , this may not be best suited but , it ’ s well worth checking out . The service fantastic and food was great ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] the o ##m ##ni in down ##ton ##w Chicago is a safe , secure and f ##re ##ind ##ly place to stay when visiting Chicago . the staff is exceeding ##ly help ##fu , the meeting rooms are clean and convenient and the social areas are comfortable and inviting with fantastic views of downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful and the staff was excellent . They all were very friendly and helpful . The v ##alet and bell staff were great . The hotel is in the heart of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . We were steps away from all kinds of restaurants and shopping . We loved the suite with the door between the bedroom area and the living area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Modern , taste ##ful , professional people , great amenities , super location . Close to shopping & restaurants . Would definitely stay here again . It was a business meeting and the food for breakfast and lunch were delicious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in Chicago for a concert at the United Center . Park ##ed the car in the ramp just a block away for $ 43 . Used U ##ber for less than $ 10 to get to the show . The hotel was clean , classic , and the staff was outstanding . I was offered an upgrade , and g ##rac ##iously accepted a Jr . Suite . I was on the 9th floor , so I was not bothered by any street noise . The room was nice , but a little warm . I could not get it below 70 degrees . The bed was very comfortable , and the bathroom had a wonderful walk - in shower . The restaurant and bar were nice and open . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A pretty and accessible g ##em of a small hotel in the Gold Coast area . A favorite place for a weekend in town , as well as , s longer stay . Shopping is very convenient as is access ##ibly to theater , Opera and museums . Many great restaurants nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Extreme ##ly disappointed . Don ' t bother staying here . We were charged are very high rate because of marathon weekend and regret ever choosing this hotel ! Out ##dated rooms . St ##aine ##d & torn carpet , poor lighting , burned out light bulb ##s , s ##cu ##ffed base boards . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were celebrating our 40 ##tt ##h wedding anniversary and so jet ##line cruise ##s put out holiday together . We were given suite 91 ##7 and the reception were able to accommodate our early arrival with a suite upgrade . Had $ 75 taken as a hold in case we ruined anything . Move ##d into our room 91 ##7 and had separate sitting area but we we ’ re surrounded by all the extract fans External ##ly to 3 sides that were 24 consistently noisy for the 3 buildings in that area , added to the refrigerator noise was too much . Not much to offer at the hotel , no de ##ts given of breakfast or meals so your on your own to sort stuff out . Wouldn ’ t return as p ##lent ##iful of hotels with more to offer that we would choose over this one . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall it ’ s a good hotel and the location is amazing . . . just by the Chicago River . . . but the W ##i ##F ##i signal is bad . . . I tried a lot of time to re ##set . . . but the problem continues . . . and also I was upset because a I thought they had a pool [SEP]
1	[CLS] Price ##y hotel . Charge ##s for w ##if ##i , refrigerator , $ 33 b ##uff ##et breakfast , no compliment ##ary newspaper . Mini bar and snack tray auto charge if you remove an item so you cannot remove items to use the mini bar as a refrigerator . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful but long lines to speak to her . Near Navy Pier . W ##al ##green ##s and Whole Foods nearby . Walk ##able to loop L station . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the opening of the door the first time through to the last goodbye it was a great visit . Mr . Jones at the front desk took great care of us and ensured we had everything we needed . The amenities were just right and the touch points with the team as much or as little as you desired . Breakfast on every floor was nice . A perfect grab - n - go city style setup . The restaurant on the corner has unique and ta ##sty fare with a reasonable late night menu that delivers to your door . Quite nice all around , we ' ll be back . Thanks Ki ##nz ##ie ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My recent stay at the Intercontinental was short but so pleasant . It is in a prime location on Michigan Ave right by the river . Easy walk to everything you want to see ! The service is equally as nice as well as the fitness center and pool ! I would highly recommend the Inter ##con ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms and breakfast each day were excellent . The staff was very polite and enthusiastic and made you feel welcome . They tried hard to make your stay really wonderful . It is important that I recognize Ivan from the breakfast staff . I expressed a concern about an issue he took upon himself to solve . All the following days he made my stay extra nice because he resolved my issue . Thank you Ivan for personally assisting me . The only complaint was the internet reception was not good in our room . Finally we got a boost ##er that worked but it was still slower than I would have liked . They are up ##grading the system so I hope it will be high powered and fast for the next visit . Thank you for a nice stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at the Talbot ##t couldn ’ t have been more pleasant . Their service was the amazing . The hotel furnishings give you a mid century modern feel . The room was spacious and spot ##less . I loved the old school door ##bell . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a conference and the hotel is nice - the location can ' t be beat ! Very lose to Grant Park and the lakes ##hore trail . Beautiful view of the park , museum and Soldier Field . The room was nice and the bed comfortable . The bathroom had a tub and shower . P ##lent ##y of elevators and they move quickly . The restaurant on site is nice and the conference facilities are fine . I would definitely stay here again for business or for fun . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super ##b lo ##cat ##il ##n , very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff beginning with front office manager , Marcus Li ##pse ##y and con ##cier ##ge , T ##iara . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed and pillows and very quiet room . Clean , as advertised and within walking distance to everything . I plan on this being my home away from home every time I visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in Chicago for a conference and this was a good place , close to attractions with plenty of meeting space . The room and common areas were nicely appointed , but hallway ##s were very dated . The bathroom ##s need to be updated with adequate lighting added . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is such a stupid little thing but no in room coffee except room service . Super in ##con ##ven ##ient . Yet my Hampton Inn night before for 1 / 3 the price had coffee in my room . This is just dumb ! I wish someone would explain the thinking behind this . And it was on top of waiting at the front desk for the team member to rear ##rang ##e things to give me a room . I think for this level of hotel and this price it should be better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was amazing and the room was so modern and com ##fy . We absolutely loved it and the stock ##ed mini ##bar . Bed was great and the carpet was so ##oo ##oo soft ! ! I know weird . . . but whenever I stay in hotel I always wear socks because the carpet just bugs me . Not this hotel I was just rubbing my feet all over it . It was so nice . Lo ##L . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend the breakfast sandwich , I wanted to buy another and take it to go because it was so good . Overall amazing stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nice and clean Fe ##lt safe Close to food and night clubs Staff was helpful and pleasant I would come back to this Hotel and would recommend it to my friends The fact that you are in Chicago and the location the price was a very good value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice clean room . We would have liked coffee / tea making facilities in the room . The was very little information about Chicago which we had to get elsewhere . Other than checking in and out we had no contact with any staff . We didn ' t use the bar or restaurants [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed 5 nights at this property while attending a convention in Chicago . The downtown location is near many restaurants , the river , and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It offers the standard Home ##wood rooms , which appear to have been recently renovated . Mine was very clean and well maintained . Be prepared for quite a bit of noise from the street . . . . sire ##ns through most of the night . The inside of the hotel is quiet . The included breakfast was pretty good , probably better than average for Home ##wood . My only complaint was that the banana ##s were over - ripe to the point of being m ##ush . There ' s a small gym on the 19th floor . The equipment is OK but the TV on the el ##liptic ##al didn ' t work ( a common problem ) . Regardless of a couple of small problems , I ' d certainly go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was alright , beds kinda small but after I left I was charged an additional $ 132 from what the in ##vo ##ice says was the contents of the mini fridge / bar . I did not consume a single item in here and due to this charge will be choosing to stay at another hotel should I ever be in the city again . We were going to put our bottles of water in there when I noticed the sign that says you ' d be charged if you use their fridge for storage so we left our water out at room temperature . I did pull out a can or two just to see the contents and put them back . So if that ' s the case I got charged $ 132 for looking at 2 cans of soda and putting them back . Total ##ly unacceptable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff is always friendly and excellent . The corner rooms offer amazing views . Great up ##ke ##ep of the facility and my rooms are always very clean . Close walk to Navy Pier . The Palm restaurant is attached to the hotel which is convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is f ##abulous . Right on the river . Room was very comfortable . Service great . High ##ly recommended . One small suggestion to the management : I appreciate having the many USB outlets on the lamps but personally I ’ d much prefer power outlets . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room faced a brick wall which was OK with us . The 6 : 30 garbage pick up didn ' t bother me because I was awake . However , the AC fan has one speed , H ##IG ##H and , it blows right on your neck . I was instructed on how to turn it off as there were only controls for the te ##mp and not the fan speed . Fortunately , it was a cool night and we were comfortable . The worst was the tub which had NO H ##AN ##D RA ##IL ##S ! Aren ' t hand rails / grip ##s an OS ##HA requirement in hotels ? I have traveled all over the world , take 4 - 6 trips a year and , yes , occasionally a two hundred year old hotel in Europe doesn ' t have hand grip ##s but , never in the US ! It also didn ' t have a bath mat . For this reason alone , I could never stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great conference hotel but too big for my preference ! Nice couple of bars and an excellent gym . The location of my room was a little dark and dated . Also has a pool and roof terrace . Good location for access anywhere in the city and McCormick [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Swiss is a great get ##away spot . You can always find great deals like park and stay that will not leave you disappointed . We love going here for a couple of days over the holidays I would highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##sist ##ently stellar service , from the moment you walked in the door , till after you left . Professional staff ( thanks Cassie ! ) left no detail to chance . Room ##s were well appointed . Hotel in a prime location . One of my best travel experiences ever ! Thanks Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro ! ! ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] From check in to check out , everything was great . Room ##s were spacious and luxurious , very clean , nice views and quiet for being in the middle of a busy city . The location made it feel like we were in the middle of everything . Most everything was within walking distance including some of the best restaurants and sites in the city . It ' s a short L ride to W ##rig ##ley . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We made this establishment home for a get - a - way weekend . We don ' t typically drive to Chicago , and we always stay downtown . We op ##t for hotels that are within good walking distance from places we like to frequent . This hotel isn ' t far from the Chicago River or Navy Pier , and many dining establishments . Check - in and check - out were sea ##m ##less . The lobby , elevators and our room was clean . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for a week and loved it . Front desk ( on the top floor ) was super helpful and everything was clean . The bathroom ##s are beautiful and more than likely will stay there every time I visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly place to spend a few nights . Friendly staff and clean rooms on a daily basis . The hotel felt safe and secure as they locked the doors at night and only accessible if you had a room key . Also well located for what we wanted to see and do in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room and hotel very nice and clean . Friendly staff with excellent service . The breakfast and manager ’ s dinner was exceptional . Very clean clean convenient to everything downtown and only 4 miles from W ##rig ##ley Field [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this property in early November 2017 and it was great . The hotel de ##cor is beautiful and the staff is very friendly . The hotel hosts a compliment ##ary wine hour each evening was great . It ' s my 2nd Kim ##pton hotel experience and both were great . I would choose Kim ##pton hotels for future trips . The only downfall was the size of the room . I reserved a room w / a king size bed and it was very small and the bathroom was especially small . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay . Con ##ven ##ient to the convention center . Food service was good . Room ##s were quite comfortable and room ##y . Hotel was quite clean . Con ##cier ##ge was very helpful . Location was very good . Close to everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This historic hotel has been updated and is an ideal location on Michigan Ave . Great for business and lots of families here as well . It has a large pool and excellent fitness facility , all located on the 8th floor . Service was excellent and lot ' s of restaurants and sights ##ee ##ing right in the neighborhood . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really wonderful hotel with floor to ceiling windows . Our room had an elegant feel yet it ’ s extremely modern . Staff was friendly and helpful . It ’ s located central to most tourist attractions and a 30 minute scenic walk to the Art Institute . If you ’ re there and Hamilton is still playing go see it it ’ s amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon check - in the agent was helpful along the stay the bell ##man , Rest ##ura ##nt staff helpful very detailed on your service . When requested room service it was done in a time ##ly matter . In addition plenty of options for dining . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The best stay ever ! ! If ever on a business trip the H ##ya ##tt Regency is the place to be . The location was the best and the view was everything . It was so great , I plan on bring my whole family back for a visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ing the hotels location and views ! We had a super experience checking in . Our agent was Nicole H and she went above and beyond in making our room location and features exactly what we needed to make our stay the best ever ! Stay ##ed on 33rd floor and the views were great ! All the staff are very nice and will definitely will stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Though it was a short stay , I would rate this hotel as G ##RE ##AT ! They have a compliment ##ary happy hour at night and tea and coffee in the morning . Georg ##ina provided excellent service with an awesome upgrade . I would highly recommend this hotel based on it ' s location , service , and am ##bian ##ce . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We usually stay at a chain hotel , but thought we would try The Talbot ##t after reading the reviews on line . we were very happy with our decision . Great value ! Excellent staff ! Very good food and great service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My partner and I stayed at this hotel for a week over the Christmas period . From the minute we walked in to this hotel , we instantly fell in love ! Custom ##er service was amazing and checking in from travelling over 18 hours was just a breeze ( thank ##yo ##u ) . Perfect location for shopping . We can ’ t wait to return . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Third time ’ s a charm , but so was the first and second . My flight was delayed after my conference and I was able to walk to the millennium park , see Buckingham Fountain , and the Art Institute of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a cool historic hotel right across from the also - famous Drake Hotel , another serious historic monster at the north end , and right across from the beaches of Lake Michigan . K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker has an old world charm and a pleasant attention to service . The rooms are decent size and in good condition . Pretty reasonable value also , and you ' re literally a stone ' s throw from Michigan Ave . Louis V ##uit ##ton is a couple doors down . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I must say that my stay in h ##ya ##tt was near perfect . I got the river view of lake mi ##chi ##gan and it was mind blowing . Room and bathroom was very clean and well serviced . hotel reception and staff were very helpful an ##f friendly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love the Ki ##nz ##ie Chicago Hotel ! The location is ideal , the rooms & furnishings are wonderful , love the variety & convenience of breakfast , plus their fun Happy Hour ! Best thing is their staff . . . friendly and so helpful . Ki ##nz ##ie is my first choice whenever I visit Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent staff , great location - convenient to public transit , River North and the Loop . Wine reception . Window seats , animal print robes . What more will one say ? Op ##t for a River view room if you can . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thank you Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel I was pleasant ##ly surprised when I entered my suite , room # 62 ##9 It was very clean , spacious and just beautiful . The floor to ceiling windows made my view , well it was amazing & W ##aking up was breath ##taking ! The front desk employees Robert & Alex were very professional & friendly . I will be staying here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I found this hotel on a Travel ##Z ##oo deal . The Talbot was AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! ! ! Clean , I cannot stress this enough , so clean ! And the water pressure was on point , a lot of places miss this . We can ’ t wait to come back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nicole is a superior part of the experience here in Chicago . Everything with her service was excellent . She recommended an upgrade for a reasonable rate that turned my stay from routine business trip to an awesome Lake and Sky ##line vacation ! I also needed a reference on where to buy a watch ( forgotten at home ) and she knew the best places to direct me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t used to be a lovely hotel with a bit of an old - world feel . But it has been renovated into a very ordinary property with down - sized rooms , a cold draft ##y entry ##way and restaurant , and minimal room amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a very nice stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand Hotel . The staff did a great job at check in and helping throughout my stay . The bed was one of the most comfortable I ' ve slept in . The location is great with easy , walking access to many restaurants downtown , Navy Pier , and the lake front . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Too many mi ##s ##cue ##s with my stay . Room service card never got picked up , therefore , no breakfast . Tri ##ed eating lunch in the pump room and the kitchen was closed . Room was much smaller than two other rooms I was in , which we all paid the same amount . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At check in time , the staff asked me if I want to pay $ 25 for they available better room . Very shocked , as a Gold member , if hotel has available better room , it should be compliment ##ary offered . And another thing is the whole hotel run out the slip ##pers , which is something should not happen in Conrad hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We needed to book a room with very short notice and J ##ac ##lyn was so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! She gave us a few options , all were reasonably priced . I ' ve worked in customer service and sales for over 15 years and I felt she went above and beyond to help us ! Swiss ##ote ##l is in a great location , just a short walk from Michigan a ##ve and Grant Park . 10 / 10 , would definitely come back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wen ##t to Chicago for a special occasion and stayed at the Hotel Monaco . Un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly great stay ! From the exceptional staff in all areas to the wonderful room with a fantastic view of the river . You cannot beat this hotel for a wonderful all around experience ! i personally don ' t ever want to stay anywhere else in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been visiting the Palmer House every Thanksgiving weekend for thirty years and love the location , amenities and service . However , this trip made me less than thankful . We enjoyed our stay as always , but when I got home , I found over $ 250 in charges on my credit card . E ##vide ##ntly the mini bar is " weighted " , so if you move a can of chips from one location to another it automatically charges you . When I called to in ##quire about the charges , hotel staff was rude and ridiculous . Not up to the usual Palmer House standards . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is great - the people are great - the location is perfect ( right on Michigan Avenue , so within a short walk to shopping in many of the best stores , also to several wonderful restaurants ) and the breakfast b ##uff ##et was amazing . High ##ly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first solo business trip , and the Conrad had everything I needed . I was away from school , although classes are still in session , and the hotel has a business printer , which allowed me to stay on top of my classes . I loved my stay , it was very relaxing and comfortable . The hotel is close to a lot of food places - - Shake S ##hack , Friday ##s , etc . and that was very convenient . The service was amazing and the people at the door were nothing but nice , sincere and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble people . 10 / 10 would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great room , quiet , the con ##cier ##ge was helpful and friendly , the wine bar staff was knowledge ##able and the happy hour perfect ! ! The wine bar served cheese and small plates but the go ##ur ##met chocolate was the star [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a good stay here . Within 2 - 3 blocks of the Goodman , next door to the Palace and close to many good restaurants . Macy ’ s just down the street . The staff was extremely nice and helpful . It ’ s a beautiful hotel - historic and full of style . The room had all the amenities that we needed . It was a little small but very comfortable and a great price ! We will definitely keep this hotel in mind especially when we come for a theater performance ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel often and like to stay where I know . A couple years ago I ended up here by chance , and I ’ m glad I did ! When in the Wind ##y City this is where I want to be . Great location ( right on the Mile ) , on ##sight dining , 2 lounge ##s if you desire a cocktail , amazing staff from the moment you step out of your cab , and very comfortable rooms . I ’ ve enjoyed both the fitness center and pool . Breakfast was better than a lot of places I ’ ve been at . I have Zero complaints about the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago ! Great location , Great Staff , and Great am ##men ##ities ! My favorite place to stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Off ##ered an upgrade upon check - in . Oh , lovely . Great . Okay , that ' ll be X amount more . Si ##gh . . . Okay . Higher floor . Perhaps better view . Not sure . But I suppose glad I did . And I thought they were just being nice . Room was nice . Property was nice . Location was convenient to what we wanted to do and see . [SEP]
1	[CLS] like the location we went by the 4th of July we had a good time watching fireworks on our room we had a good time and booked again but we were disappointed they closed the swim ##in pool to built another fitness center Bad idea for tourist . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was spacious . The street noise is bother ##some ( not much the hotel can do about this ) , and the " social hour " put on by the hotel was disappointing . Two of the three nights we were there consisted only of salad ##s with nothing hot in the way of app ##eti ##zers . The staff were very friendly and did their best to accommodate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came to Chicago to celebrate our anniversary . Our stay at the Hotel Monaco could not have been more perfect ! Staff were always super friendly and warm . Very helpful too ! We were so excited when we were given a complementary room upgrade ( to a room with a water view ) when we mentioned it was our anniversary . The river view and window seat were great , bed super com ##fy and all the amenities we needed ! The wine happy hour daily was great too ! ! The hotel itself was perfectly situated for everything you want to see and do near downtown / millennium park area , River North , and very close to several L lines to take you anywhere you need ! We ' d happily stay here again if ever lucky enough to come back to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here five nights for a conference , which was also at the Hilton . The building is really old and historic which is very cool and kinda freak ##y at the same time . The elevators shake and rat ##tle as they go up and down , but you font feel ins ##ec ##ure . For me , the location was awesome , as it sits outside the very dense , tourist ##y area of Michigan a ##ve , but still close enough to travel there . I wouldn ' t hesitate to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came here to stay one night and due to weather issues we ended up ta ##cking on a second night . Very at ##ten ##tive and polite staff , upgraded our room both nights to a 2 bed without hesitation . Co ##ck ##tails at the ma ##rt ##ini bar were excellent , breakfast was excellent at ni ##x and so convenient to have great food and not have to brave the cold to go find it ! excellent location , close to great restaurants and shopping . Save ##d us money because we never had to pay any cab fare ##s , everything was in walking distance . F ##Y ##I Walton is a 1 way street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful large rooms , exceptionally large bathroom , very helpful staff ! Michigan Ave is just steps away from hotel . You can easily walk to Water tower place , Nord ##strom , N ##eim ##an Marcus , Sa ##ks Fifth Avenue , Cafe Lu ##xe , and Do - rite don ##uts is a block away for a fantastic breakfast sandwich or out of this world don ##ut ! We went there both mornings we were there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was quiet , excellent sleeping environment . The meeting rooms were easy to find . Your sign ##age made it easy to navigate . All the staff were great . I felt safe at all times . I liked your small coffee ##maker in the room [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great location . Just off Michigan Avenue . Close to all the shops and an easy walk to Navy Pier . Friendly staff . On arrival was greeted with a big smile and very clean rooms . High ##ly recommend . Will stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] My industry has a conference in Chicago every year and I always stay at this hotel whenever I attend the conference . It ' s nice having a bedroom that ' s separate from the living room and having a full kitchen . The rooms are always nicely kept and the staff are always helpful . A big bonus is having a full breakfast b ##uff ##et , including eggs , bacon or sa ##usage , fruit , yo ##gu ##rt , o ##at ##me ##al , cereal ##s , past ##ries , and various juice ##s . I like it ' s location close to the Red Line , Michigan Ave , and downtown . The one complaint I have is that the hotel tends to be on the dry side . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a nice location . It is clean and the bell staff is great . The front desk staff was not great . We had an issue with a misleading promotion on their own website and there was no effort to resolve the issue . The beds are not queen sized , they are double beds and had we known we would not have booked . Otherwise , a nice average hotel I n a great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel , great location , very good service , bar was lively and restaurant was good too . Room ##s were bright and very comfortable . . . sounds silly , but I loved their comfort ##er and pillows . One recommendation , have a pitcher of water near coffee in restaurant for those who don ' t want to use a plastic water bottle . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in Chicago Downtown , very close to Mill ##eni ##um Park where the Bean ( Cloud Gate ) is located . A couple minutes walking you will reach the reach the Chicago river ##walk and the Michigan Avenue ( the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ) . The people are friendly , the service is good , and also it was safe walking around the area at night . All in all it was a good experience . If you need breakfast , there ' s a Del ##i called Bo ##ck ##win ##kel ' s just behind the hotel open from 7 ##AM . The sandwiches are good . Warning : for people from South East Asia region , who are used to the 5 - star experiences in hotels throughout SE ##A , you will find yourself comparing the services and the amenities . My suggestion is , D ##ON ' T . Different customs , just enjoy the location and the friend ##liness of the staff , [SEP]
1	[CLS] We took advantage of a travel zoo special and hit the jack pot , the location of this hotel was perfect . The hotel is very clean and the staff was f ##abulous and kind . Would stay there again and highly recommend this location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is a beautiful hotel , in an ideal location , with a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff that have gone above and beyond to make every stay exceptional . K ##wa ##me and Edward at the front desk hooked us up and helped us check in early , reviewed our it ##iner ##ary and made great recommendations on the best spots to eat , drink , and visit during our down ##time . She ##r at the con ##cier ##ge desk setup all our reservations and transportation . Everything has been more than we could ask for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##abulous is all I can say . A ##rri ##ved with my family on Saturday and as requested our room was ready ! River view room and what a view , especially loved the window seats ( larger than a seat , more like a sofa ) . Staff was at ##ten ##tive . . . . . . housekeeper ##s , v ##alet and front desk . Sign up to be a Kim ##pton em ##ber for the free w ##if ##i , $ 10 room fridge credit and upon our return form day one of sight seeing they left 2 cup ##cakes and thank you card . This is in a great location , across for the river , around the corner from the " L " subway line . Quick trip to W ##ril ##ge . In case this is important to anyone , We all slept like rocks on the very comfortable bed ##ding will definitely be looking a Kim ##pton hotel in the next city we visit ! ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] What this even better was the prime location of hotel . When I return I will return to stay here . I get it was an older building but yet it was maintained clean and room temperature was comfortable . Everyone was very friendly and helpful [SEP]
1	[CLS] I moved to this hotel from a hotel in S ##ko ##kie , IL , which I didn ' t like . I wish I had come here at the beginning . I got a Junior Suit , which was more that 750 sq ft apartment . Fantastic de ##cor , nice and clean bathroom , high quality linen ##s and towels , breakfast area with table and chairs , living room ' s sofa is so big and com ##fy that I slept on that . Next to the Millennium Park , and in the heart of Chicago downtown . You do not need any car / taxi to explore the city . It is very close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room over looked the Mill ##in ##ual Park , could see the lake , the Natural History Mu ##es ##um and the Plan ##ata ##rium . Beautiful views , nicely appointed room , close to many attractions and very kind employees . Was there for a conference and felt welcomed and valued . The price was very reasonable for Downtown Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Intercontinental for a full week while in Chicago teaching and had a fantastic experience . From check - in to check - out all was wonderful , not just good . The staff was helpful and tried to anti ##ci ##pate what I would want . My room was quiet , providing for a great nights sleep . It was comfortable and a pleasant place to spend time resting for the next day . The work ##out room and pool are NO ##T TO B ##E MI ##SS ##ED ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel room was perfect . Only four elevators for a 26 floor hotel . We waited 15 minutes for an elevator on the 14th floor at check out because every door that opened was full . Staff was awesome and location was superb . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a central ##ly located hotel - near Michigan Ave . shopping and Looking ##glass Theatre . Our hotel room was large - with lots of floor space and has been modern ##ized so it was very comfortable . The hotel lobby was lovely . We did not attend the history talk but apparently every Friday there is a free talk about the hotel ' s history . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister and I came in to town for a quick girls trip and had a f ##abulous stay at the All ##egro ! We were able to get an early check - in , Todd was very helpful ! Our room was super trend ##y and clean ! We enjoyed their compliment ##ary champagne social before we headed out for dinner and a concert . We enjoyed a great conversation with Da ##ja and Bryant who shared great information about the hotel ' s history ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly will book again for another trip to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel . Third time to stay there and I always enjoy it . I was in Chicago for a conference , but instead of staying at the conference hotel , I walked daily in the snow and cold weather to stay at the Monaco . That is how much I enjoy the hotel . Great people - friendly service - excellent location . I will def ##ini ##nte ##ly be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was overall a nice hotel . Very clean , polite staff and we were treated equally for the 3 days we stayed here . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary W ##i ##F ##i because of our room . . . B ##O ##UN ##S ! The only complaint I would have is there ’ s no microwave or anywhere to heat your food up . I also believe it should be noted on the website that the Fitness center / room is being renovated and the walk to the closest one is 5 minutes away . They do provide you with an v ##ou ##cher to use the work ##out area . Nice view [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location close to Park and within walking distance of the bean . Service at hotel was great . C ##VS across the street . Love ##d my stay . Bus and taxi was close by . We walked and caught the free trolley to the Navy Pier . I would stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every year we plan a Christmas trip to Chicago with friends to enjoy the holiday spirit along the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . We usually stay at the Intercontinental because from the minute Will greet ##s us as we step out of the taxi to the reservation desk where we are greeted with a friendly smile the service continues to be excellent until we check out . If you are looking for a hotel with easy access to shopping . food and fun the Intercontinental is an excellent choice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Warm and friendly staff in a small , persona ##ble hotel . Everyone seems happy to be working at the Talbot ##t . Great location within walking distance of Michigan Ave and wonderful restaurants . I love the Gold Coast area of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , beautiful Gold Coast neighborhood . Stay and walk . Lo ##bby is beautiful , great bedrooms , bathroom / hallway ##s clean but seemed down a notch in quality , layout and aesthetics compared to the rest of the property , adjusted for price . Had amazing coffee in Library room off main lobby . P ##ump room , didn ' t eat there , but for history and setting , likely worth the try . Co ##m ##fy bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great central location however info on amenities not posted in room as they typically are - otherwise , we may have taken advantage of them . We had 2 adjoining rooms which was good because the room with 1 king bed was incredibly small . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights at this grand hotel . Very favorable experience overall . Great location near lake ##front , Lincoln Park , Old Town etc . Bed ##s are low to floor but very comfortable . Bath ##room is small but service ##able . I was given a room directly in front of elevators , but thankful ##ly noise was not bad . Great bar in hotel also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a loyal Hilton customer . I have come to expect certain things since co ##vid ; reduced amenities being one of them . However I was shocked to find that after I booked the hotel again closed their pool and fitness center . I was not aware of this until check in . The other gym ##s in the area were open . This hotel is on a major road leading out of the city . On the weekend there is a constant stream of people showing Off their cars and motorcycles . Even on the 11th floor you can hear it plain as day . The room was clean and well stock ##ed . I would stay here again but with lower expectations . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Train your employees to listen to your customers concerns , even if there is nothing they can do for them . If someone requests a wake - up call make sure it happens , luck ##ily I set my phone and the in room clock . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Outstanding customer service from all staff we came in contact with , great food on ##site , clean and charming rooms , excellent location . Stay ##ed for 4 nights and also held a dinner for 35 in their Reed Room . We were extremely pleased with everything about our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 4 nights at the Fair ##mont in Chicago . Fair ##mont Hotels have a great reputation . This property was dated , needs an update . Their is only one small restaurant which was very expensive and lacked any imagination [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is beautiful , very high end and class ##y . We came as a family with young child to spend time together . Our reward to our son was being able to go swimming at the end of the day . We booked the hotel based on it having a pool . The pool was closed an according to the front desk staff it has been closed for quite awhile . No coffee maker in room , no refrigerator , room was surface cleaned , but don ’ t look under beds , thick dust , empty water bottles and found a pair of someone ’ s running shoes . The toilet backed up , tub c ##log ##ged and bathroom sink broke . The hotel is past its prime as things are falling apart . [SEP]
1	[CLS] W ##O ##OW , what a beautiful hotel , it was amazing . Staff very friendly , very clean and perfect location for the museums . It was fantastic in the snow over looking the lake . It was amazing building , with amazing American history . We loved it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 7 nights and couldn ' t be happier . The friend ##liness of the staff from the port ##ers to reception to the bar is 10 / 10 . Everyone genuinely looks happy to be there and some of them have been for 10 + years . Room ##s are spacious , lots of closet space . I had an issue with my room and they immediately fixed the problem and sent a beautiful bottle of red wine to say sorry . I travel a lot for work , and I have to say I am yet to find fault with this hotel . Chi ##c , clean , and amazing service . Thanks for an amazing stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable . The bathroom was modern with separate bath and shower . Location great - I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go . Quiet - I got great rest . It was great to have the k ##eur ##ig coffee maker for great coffee 1st thing ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything about this hotel is just wonderful . It feels co ##zy and inviting , and the staff were all wonderful and extremely at ##ten ##tative . The updates that they did the hotel have a very luxurious feel while keeping the charm of the hotel . will definitely be back ! PS L ##O ##VE that they are dog friendly ! ! Made my life so easy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel although older has been updated many times . The rooms are very nice and always spot ##less . The check ##in was pain ##less as was the check ##out . The staff from lobby to rooftop bar were engaging and friendly . Obviously a well managed property for such a big facility . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is very central ##ly located in the Loop and is beautiful inside . I like the fact that there are several stores located inside with things that someone would actually be interested in buying . Some of the stores also stay open until 10 , which helps . The front desk was also very pleasant and helpful , albeit under ##sta ##ffed . Here is the rub : Over - priced and very loud rooms because the CT ##A trains sound like they are coming into your room . Come here for the location . However , I personally prefer the Palmer House , which is also nicely located , elegant , quiet , and normally cheaper . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent experience . Will go back again . If you can pick a room with a view above floor 20 . We were on 9th floor . It was still an excellent experience but I would op ##t for more height . The only draw back was the carpet in our room was dirt ##ish . It was v ##ac ##um ##med just needed to be changed I think . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were very pleased with our stay at the Hotel . The ##as very co ##zy , clean and comfortable . We truly enjoyed the large tube , only wishing the shower had an attachment because of my height [UNK] . The staff Arturo G ##ar ##za was very , professional , friendly , engaging and patient , he really made feel welcome . I would definitely recommend this Hotel to all my friends and family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Man ##dan ##a , s ##har ##on and mug ##i are very at ##ten ##tive and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Always eager to serve and share local knowledge . Looking forward to our return . It ' s hard being con ##cise with a minimum 200 character review . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is nice , the bed was a bit pit ##ted put comfortable , there were black - out shades , and the room was generally clean . W ##if ##i worked well . The continental breakfast is fine , and it ' s convenient that they set out food and coffee on every floor . From 5 - 8 every night , there ' s a sort of happy hour , and the hotel gives each adult guest one coin / night , which you can trade in for a drink . There is , however , a hidden fee of $ 16 . 50 / day ( $ 14 . 95 plus $ 1 . 53 in tax ) , which the hotel doesn ' t ad ##vert ##ise . When I checked in , I even asked if there were additional charges and was told there weren ' t , but there is . I don ' t like this little game that hotels play so that their advertised prices than look lower than their competitors ' . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for several nights at the end of August . Location was very convenient to various attractions and restaurants . The rooms had modern , ch ##ic de ##cor but were still comfortable . The free breakfast was nice , especially since each floor had their own spread . The only down side would be a not so great view of the H ##VA ##C systems of the various buildings next to our room . But we understand that when we get a room at a city hotel this is a chance we take . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this hotel for a lot of reasons . Room was not huge but big enough , but it was what the hotel offered which was great . Weather ranged from nice and warm to freezing cold and snow ##y over the 6 days there . But no matter , hotel had numerous eating options and two bar / restaurants , and many more close by . High ##light was the G ##ym & Pool . G ##ym very well stock ##ed and maintained . even had an indoor running track . La ##p pool only 20 ##ft but great for laps . Also had a couple of spa pools . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel . Service was amazing . Great views of the area . Close to lots of great dining options , shopping , tourist ##y stuff etc . . . . traffic in the area s ##tin ##ks . Clean rooms , really comfortable bed . Good shower ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was very close to where I needed to be , the rooms were a little noisy but comfortable . However , it has been a long time since I stayed in a room that didn ' t have a coffee ##maker or at least have free coffee in the lobby ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful and clean , great location . Staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We wish the hotel bars and restaurant had been open . Room ##s had been recently updated . Only negative was the toilets flushed very loudly and you could hear your neighbors toilets flush ##ing in the middle of the night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our last stop on a cross country road trip with four children . The v ##alet , check in and breakfast staff were outstanding . All were very at ##ten ##tive and patient . I ’ ve stayed other places in Chicago but can say with certainty this will be a repeat stay for us . Hu ##ge shout out to Jeremy from the breakfast staff - if management sees this , you need to know that he deserves an award for his at ##ten ##tive ##ness and patience ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my second stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . The first time was about 2 years ago . The staff made such an impression that I was excited to have the chance to stay again this time around . Edward greeted me warmly and upgraded me to a corner room even though I hadn ' t requested a change . He also assisted me when I checked out . Just as pleasant first thing in the morning when I was leaving as he had been when I checked in . The room could have used a bit of p ##olis ##hing up , but the bed was super com ##fy and the bathroom was the perfect size . I have stayed in many different hotels in Chicago , some p ##ric ##ier , some cheaper . This one continues to be my favorite ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I hope other hotels in Chicago have better rooms and food for the money . The rooms are old and not well maintained . It took two days for my room to warm up to comfortable level . You have to walk out of hotel to get a proper coffee in the morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] i cannot recommend the ambassador highly enough . the location is great , the property lovely , the staff amazing , and the value un ##par ##alle ##led . we had a standard room and the simple ch ##ic style was perfect . super home ##base for a weekend get ##away ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We will be back ! We had the perfect stay at the O ##m ##ni Hotel in Chicago . We absolutely loved the location , the staff was excellent , 67 ##6 serves delicious breakfast and drinks and the room size was outstanding for downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although I only travel to Chicago once every few years , I always stay at the Inter ##C ##on . For years they have provided great service , a beautiful hotel and a fair price . They continued the tradition on this visit . Every aspect of arrival was spot on , from the bell ##man remembering my name , to the friendly greeting at the front desk . Room was perfect . You have to check out the pool and spa at this hotel . Amazing , and again all the staff is great . Had breakfast at the hotel . Great quality and a good value . Also met friends on two nights for Happy Hour in En ##o Wine Room . Half price weekday happy hour wine , with excellent choice in wine flights . The hotel is enough to keep me coming back , but the staff make it the only hotel I consider when traveling to Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently attend a business conference at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker hotel and was impressed with beautiful grand ##eur of the property . Room ##s had upgraded amenities , extremely comfortable beds , in a vintage style surrounding . Location was perfect and surrounded by a variety of restaurants and ups ##cale shopping . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was absolutely perfect ! From the moment we checked in , everything and everyone was incredible . A great location , an exceptionally clean room and friendly , helpful staff make this an obvious choice for anyone traveling to Chicago . High ##ly recommended ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was huge and has a beautiful city and river view . I loved the very complete gym which even had smooth ##ies to have after the work ##out and flavor ##ed waters . ( I was there pre - co ##vid ) . The bar on main level had very y ##um ##my drinks and the bartender was nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A beautiful hotel . I booked the trip one month in advance through Ex ##ped ##ia for 2 nights . It was fully paid for and I confirmed that with an in ##vo ##ice . I had to add an extra night and was told that I could pay for the additional night when I arrived . I also brought a dog for which a $ 250 re ##fu ##nda ##ble deposit was needed . When I arrived I gave them my credit card to pay for the additional night , and I gave them my boyfriend ' s card , telling them this is only for the dog fee . They charged my boyfriend ' s card over $ 1 , 000 for two nights and charged my card for one night . They said there was a mistake but are refusing to re ##fu ##nd us the $ 1 , 000 . This is at ##ro ##cious and fraud ##ulent of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although the rooms were small , there was a lot of charm at the Ambassador Chicago . The staff was incredibly helpful when we asked about dining recommendations as well . V ##isi ##t the restaurant on site for a great cocktail , and then make sure you head down stairs to view all the old photos of famous people who have visited the restaurant over the decades . Lots of history here ! Also , very close to the lake . The walls were thin , and almost everyone in our group had a story to tell about their neighbor . That ' s my biggest complaint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After check in while so ##tto g in the room a gentleman knocked on the door . He had liquor in his hand . I later found out he was rest ##ock the mini bar . That in the card in the room said was complete ( they could of charged me ) I had asked where the ice machine was and he told me to read the signs . As I walked the hallway . There were no signs . I later found out that it was on another floor . So my suggestion is ask all your questions at the front desk . Last thing is the elevators state ma ##x 6 people . On my way down 10 more people sq ##uished on . They need bigger signs or something because that elevators jerked all the way down . I then walked the 9 floors as i di ##s t want to get stuck . So don ' t walk too much so you can climb the stairs [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed numerous times at s ##wi ##sso ##tel ##s around the world . This time staying at the Swiss ##ote ##l on W ##ack ##er road in Chicago was somewhat a disappointment . No s ##ham ##po ##o , soap etc . in the room Bed had an unpleasant smell and feel to it Breakfast at the Palm restaurant in the Hotel took a long time and was served cold . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly though . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The bathroom lighting was seriously def ##icient , and the room itself would be greatly improved with addition of another lamp . But the lobby of the hotel is charming , the room was comfortable , and the price was right . Despite the def ##ici ##encies , I would definitely consider returning to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has all of the amenities you ' d expect in a downtown hotel and do so at comparable price for this level of hotel brand . The rooms are clean with updated bathroom amenities . I highly recommend the " quiet " rooms . I know for a fact that our friends in the room next door pounded on the head ##boards late night to try and wake us . Not a p ##eep was heard on our side . NO ##T . . . A . . . P ##EE ##P ! No idea how they did it but that feature alone will make us come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the historical feel . The building was like stepping back into the 20 ' s but with all of today ##s amenities . So Friendly ! Everyone was so helpful . Love ##d the text to check up on us halfway through our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would stay here again . Beautiful and amazing views of the river , Navy Pier , and the lake . Like ##d the desperate run and shower as well . I ate at The Palm bar and had two great bartender ##s ( Adam and Michael ) and met so many fun and interesting people . My only complaint is the $ 70 a day parking ! So worth staying at this hotel though . Room ##s are massive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked the corner suite , and it was very nice . Especially the city view . The service was great from the door ##men , front desk and house ##keeping staff . I will definitely stay at this hotel again . The location is right in the middle of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice older / historic hotel . The location was perfect . Check in was a problem but only because we didn ' t know each person had to be listed on the account to check in and the office manager made the reservations . Had to call her to get clearance . ( Won ' t forget that again ) . The rooms are nice and clean but on the small side with is normal for an older building . Big ##ges ##t complaint is that there is about a 4 " x 6 " space available in the mini fridge for guest use and the rest is stock ##ed with gross ##ly over ##p ##rice ##d drinks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a te ##rri ##fic stay in a junior suite at this hotel . The room was elegant ##ly decorated and very comfortable . The staff was very helpful and friendly . Location was very good , one block from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and a few blocks from an L station . Breakfast was perhaps a bit on the price ##y side , but ta ##sty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of a Route 66 trip . We picked a car up after our stay here so we didn ' t have to use parking . The hotel is in a great location , by the river , near the Lake , close to shops and downtown locations . Check in was very quick and staff were always friendly and helpful . The hotel is spot ##lessly clean in very good condition . Our room was on the 11th floor , we never had to wait longer than a few seconds for the lift . The bed and pillows were very comfortable , the hotel was quiet at night , even on the last night we were there when it was very busy . We didn ' t eat at any of the hotel restaurants . This is a perfect hotel to stay in in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Room was perfect . A ##rri ##ved late , staff could not have been more helpful . Need more time to actually enjoy Chicago next time . S ##yr ##inge greeted me when I pulled up and brought my bag in for me . From the Kay ##lin got me an upgrade and into a room in short order . When going to check out Craig took my bag immediately so I could get to my meeting on time . All around excellent service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very impressive hotel . Room ##s are top notch - - clean , spacious . Bath ##room has a nice supply of towels and separate tub and shower . You would be hard pressed to find anything wrong with the Conrad . Location is excellent - - near Rush St and Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All of the Fair ##mont properties that I have stayed at have been first rate . The Chicago - Millennium Park was excellent , too . The rooms are very comfortable . I would recommend up ##grading to Fair ##mont Gold . The 15th floor Fair ##mont Gold Lounge is well worth the added cost . The only improvement needed at this property is an interior update to the first floor - it seems a bit dated . The fitness area is well equipped and brand new with a complete locker room and a steam room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had always wanted to stay at Public as I had heard it was a European style bout ##ique . I had high hopes when we arrived as the public areas reminded me of a Vienna hotel . That joy lasted until we entered our room . Taking into consideration the Gold Coast location I was disappointed in the room / bathroom size . The first words uttered were " looks like it was furnished in early I ##KE ##A " . Al ##as , the rooms look dated and could use an update , but are service ##able . I was expecting something better appointed , similar to a Euro Bo ##uti ##que or hip like The Standard . The service was excellent and the staff very g ##rac ##ious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean , elegant , wonderful location . I was very pleased with this hotel . The staff was friendly and professional . The gym was great and well maintained , plenty of equipment , fresh fruit , and water station . The minute you enter the lobby you will be impressed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Business meetings , room seemed to be newly renovated but in fact it had been a few years . speaks to the level of clean ##liness and maintenance the room are held to . Good outlet and charging support at the desk . the night stand could use outlet ports but was able to work around that . Had a question on H ##VA ##C it was so quiet you could not hear it running told the front desk and before I could get back up to my room maintenance was there Anthony very sharp art ##iculate answered all my questions exceptional employee AC was fine that ’ s just the way it worked . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Honestly , this reminded me of the scary hotel elevator ride at Disney . The hotel is in a great location and rooms are very clean but the whole thing feels very dated . I get Art Dec ##o but the pipe ##d ( 20 ##s ? ) music becomes very nausea ##ting and the ma ##rt ##ini bar was rather un ##friend ##ly . Feel ##s like it ’ s a theme hotel as opposed to something truly authentic . Limited interaction with hotel staff and I do t recall being welcomed once when walking into the hotel ( I stayed there for four nights ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At the beginning we had problems with getting the room we had booked . We still didn ' t get the corner room with double beds , but after being put in the 3rd room , we were offer a compensation for our trouble . All in all , it was a nice stay with satisfaction in the compensation . Yes , the elevators were small , but who wants to ride with a group of stranger anyway ? L ##OL The room was clean and bed was com ##fy - - - location was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Palmer House is a great hotel with a convenient location to the parade route , stores and restaurants . Staff is friendly and professional ! Room ##s are smaller because it is a historic hotel but enough room to kick back after a morning at the parade . The food is good at the B ##ur get Bat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is one of my favorites . The rooms and amenities are great . The con ##cier ##ge level is the best ! The service and restaurants are top notch . This hotel has everything . You won ’ t need to leave the building , but you might want to . It ’ s in the heart of downtown and the water features are all ##uring . : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in the perfect location ! You can walk to shopping , coffee shops , and numerous restaurants within minutes . The staff is so welcoming and the rooms are f ##abulous ! I must also say that the drinks in the bar are superb and the staff was very friendly . This will always be at the top of my list in Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago Hotel is beautiful and very elegant . It is convenient ##ly located near Michigan Avenue and the Ma ##g Mile . Several main attractions are in walking distance . I highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here on a Friday night . Check in was fast and easy . Room was ready early . The room was very nice . The room is not large but very comfortable . Everything is updated and very nice . The bar / restaurant is great . Was pretty busy and workers are really nice . Sa ##t at bar for happy hour . Came back late night and then had breakfast at the bar . Food was really good and service was great . We will definitely stay here again . The location is perfect and can walk to restaurants and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room is nice . The bed is comfortable . The bathroom is nicely updated . The TV channels are limited in my choice of viewing , but watching TV is not really why I am in Chicago now is it ? : - ) There are a lot of walk ##able attractions and restaurants nearby . There are awesome black ##out shades in the room , allows for a nice afternoon nap ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you want to stay in a nice place and be s ##cam ##med , then this is the place for you . We booked and paid through hotels . com . Upon checking in they charged us $ 100 for incident ##als . Which we authorized . The next morning the hotel charged us for the nights stay . We immediately called and the hotel admitted charging with no reason . They did not have authorization either . They used our credit without permission . After receiving the run around , they hung up on us . We then called hotels . com and repeated the situation . After asking if hotels . com and fair ##mont were splitting the interest received from holding our money , they hung up on us . The hotel said they will not re ##fu ##nd our $ 400 for five days . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel charges $ 63 for overnight v ##alet which is okay prices for Chicago . We woke up In the morning to find a bunch of massive scratch ##es in my Mercedes that were brand new . Vale ##t denied it , obviously , and refused to compensate for the hundreds , if not thousands , of dollars of damages to my brand new car . Can ’ t be b ##uffed out and will need to be fixed with a new paint job . R ##id ##ic ##ulous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Reserve ##d a king sized bed and confirmed the night prior to check ##in . A ##rri ##ved on time and they offered us a double ( full - size ) bed . After pressing , we received a queen To ##ile ##t not functioning Show ##er was g ##rung ##y Great con ##cier ##ge service Very close to Hamilton venue [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##cel ##ent location ! Fun activities with inn walking distance ! A ##wes ##ome bars & restaurants ! Too many too choose from ! L ##y ##ft & U ##ber service available with inn 2 min after request ! Try So ##fit ##els restaurant . . Nice ! Dr ##ess well , hotel too nice ! Re ##ception folks very friendly and good looking ! Love the accent [SEP]
0	[CLS] A great Hotel in The heart of the city without being in the noise and c ##raz ##iness . Our room was spacious , comfortable and had a great view . The lounge in the lobby was beautiful and inviting . We had a great breakfast in the restaurant [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had an unfortunate case of the room being dirty at check in and I completely understand some times things happen , but it ' s how they resolve it that matters . I asked to speak to the manager on duty and Robert was amazing ! ! ! Not only did he re ##ct ##ify the situation but he kept in contact with us throughout the stay to make sure we were okay and even when we departed he email ##ed us his well wishes and invited us to come back at the hotel for our daughters graduation . He showed that the kin ##zie truly cares about their customers ! I will definitely stay here again when in downtown Chicago . The rooms and amenities are excellent . Every single employee ##e I interact ##ed with was very friendly and helpful . See you in May Robert ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were at the Monaco for a long weekend in October and had just the best stay . We arrived early about 11 and Gwen Williams checked us in and was g ##rac ##ious to find us a room on the 10th floor with a window seat . It was across from the elevator but she assured us that the room would be quiet and she was correct . We enjoyed the wine and app ##eti ##zers each evening . The hotel was lovely , the staff were delight ##fully helpful , and the window seat was wonderful . It was large enough for both of us to lie with a birds eye view of the city and the river . We are so happy we stayed at the Monaco . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a business trip and enjoyed the hotel . Service , room and location were nice . But I have to dock stars because this hotel ' s t ##v system is so guest - un ##friend ##ly . They actually di ##sable the HD ##MI ports on the t ##v ' s , in what I can only assume is an attempt to force you to buy their PP ##V movies ? So if you ' re dreaming of watching your Ch ##rome ##cast or Fire Stick , think again . And as any fellow road warrior knows , it ' s the little details like this that help when away from home . If the hotel reads this : please enable the HD ##MI ports on your t ##v ' s ! It ' s 2017 and travelers have come to depend on these . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Gold Lounge is amazing . Man ##dan ##a at breakfast and the evening guys made me feel so special . Very at ##ten ##tive but not overly so . It was especially wonderful with the Christmas decorations . The food and atmosphere was warm and welcoming . Love ##d the view . I will never go elsewhere for a Chicago hotel and look forward to my next stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This location could not be much better , Near center , river , lake ##front we were there for the marathon close to start . Excellent staff very close to all services . The hotel has many services with very good and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a perfect choice if you are looking for space , a kitchen , free breakfast ( and evening reception ) and a good location . Just a block away from the Red Line Train ( super easy to get to W ##rig ##ley Field and connect to all other lines ) , 2 blocks from Michigan Ave ( The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ) and 3 blocks from the River . This was a great option for our family while there to see the sights of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Palmer House for a weekend of shopping and enjoying Chicago . The hotel is located close to Millennium Park , shopping and great restaurants . The rooms were clean and comfortable . The bathroom was small but that is expected in a historic building like Palmer House . The lobby is awesome ! ! Words cannot describe how beautiful it is . There are several shops within the hotel and a Star ##bu ##cks . Would recommend staying here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our company has been hosting this event for 10 years . This was the best facility hands down ! Check - In , El ##eva ##tor Cap ##acity & Speed , Conference Space , Room te ##mps , Food , Walk time from Room - to - Session , Internet Re ##lia ##bility for 1 , 000 + attendees and staff , and immediate response to every need we had by the Operations , Sales , & Marketing staff . The H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago has set the bar very high ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited last week for a conference of 450 people from New Zealand The service we received from all staff was excellent The hotel is in a great location to downtown Chicago From beautiful walks along the river and lake waterfront To boat cruise ##s , with detailed architectural history I would be keen to visit this hotel and city again in the summer [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was central ##ly located on Michigan Ave . The staff were all very helpful and friendly . The room was well appointed , clean and the bed / pillows comfortable . Try the restaurant . The food was excellent . They even had g ##lut ##en free toast ! Great bar and selection of wine and cocktail ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just a quick T ##HA ##N ##K YOU to Ki ##bro ##m and Mo ##ro for helping me with luggage , organizing U ##ber rides and coming up to my room and helping carry everything ! Great guys , helpful , knowledge ##able and always professional ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel and the facilities were great . Clean rooms and wash ##rooms . The location was amazing , walking distance to most major places in town . Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nobody in front desk . Never . No towels in two days . Co ##vid 19 . No sheets clean . The excuse CO ##VI ##D - 19 . That made my room . The restaurant 1 person . The self parking nobody . The elevator with trash . I m going to be here for one more night and that ’ s it . We have to pay 63 dollars per day for the parking and there the trash [UNK] are full . We have to learn a lot of America [UNK] but She ##rato ##n have to learn the service of Mexican hotels . go to Los cab ##os or Can ##c ##ún an d we show She ##rato ##n what is customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the O ##m ##ni during I ##MT ##S and the stay was wonderful . Their staff treated our team very well . Service was superior and they were always friendly . My room was clean and well appointed . I was comfortable and was able to relax after a long day at the show . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was our first time to Chicago and the security measures and the staff made myself and my son feel safe . They were super friendly and during Co ##vid - 19 I could not have asked for more ! ! The location was perfect as well for sight seeing and food options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was here for a trade show checking in was a bit of a challenge as there were tons of us there trying to get in and registered . Cars ##arra was able to roll with the punches and get is taken care of and settled . Folk ##s take for granted what people in the hospitality industry do . The staff here were able to manage our large group and still maintain everything else . It was well done and I appreciate the efforts . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , overall a good experience , but not without a few hi ##cc ##ups . Soap and towels and s ##ham ##po ##o . Under the bed was filthy . Martin ##i Bar with live entertainment was very nice . Love the pianist . Price was fair , parking across the street was very handy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were really pleased to discover that the Hotel was so central ##ly located from the Lake , the Park , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile the River ( walk ) and so many wonderful restaurants and historic buildings . The rooms are spacious and clean - it was nice to have the extra living space and not be confined to one small room . The breakfast b ##uff ##et changed daily and had fresh options such as fruit and yo ##gu ##rt . We really enjoyed the happy hour in the evening which is offered Mon - T ##hur ##s . Jeremy , who works in the hotel , was so friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting - he really excelled with his customer service and made sure all the guests were having a good time - along with making sure our wine glasses were full . We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room is average with modern de ##cor . There are plenty of outlets , USB ports and light sources . However , the room needed to be dust ##ed , the bathroom mirror needed to be replaced and the bathroom had a must ##y odor . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We really enjoyed staying at this hotel . The room was great , exactly what we wanted . The staff was all very nice and helpful . The only issue i had was the pool . The floor around the pool and hot tub was very slippery . Other than that we really enjoyed our stay [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had a wonderful stay at the Talbot ##t Hotel Chicago ! Very nice hotel with exceptional service . Very welcoming atmosphere by the staff and they really go out of their way to make you feel welcome . The location of the hotel could not be better and the rooms were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We will definitely stay here again when we visit Chicago . Make sure you take advantage of their food & beverage discount program ( if you choose to not have your room serviced you get a $ 10 discount per day to the on ##site restaurant and it was f ##abulous ) ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] room I had was smaller than I expect but didn ##t bother me as much . The customer service was phenomena ##l Mi ##che ##al and Ben were great the hotel time . They really brought a welcoming v ##ibe which was awesome . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will be staying here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I come to this hotel for Sox ##fest every January and the hotel for the most part is pretty good . In one of our rooms though , the p ##lum ##bing kept make noise at night time . It ' s classic hotel and the rooms are nice . Hopefully they work on some upgrades . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel many years ago and had a great experience . The hotel has added rain shower ##s which are terrible . A slow d ##riz ##zle in more what you get . The H ##VA ##C system in the rooms are also terrible . The rooms go from freezing cold to very hot . You will be waking up every 20 minutes to either throw the covers off you or s ##c ##rou ##ng ##ing around to avoid freeze ##r burn . I am disappointed my the entire hotel . The cleaning staff is also terrible . Don ' t expect to have clean towels or bathroom supplies unless you are into na ##gging staff for 2 days . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ##dice the manager was helpful in re ##sol ##ving a small issue for mutual satisfaction . Hotel is right behind the water tower place and very close to attractions , and Northwestern hospital that we were visiting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have stayed at this Home ##wood in the past and were very pleased . This time was no different ! The room was ex ##cell ##ant , the breakfast was delicious , and the staff was very court ##eous . The location is very convenient . Home ##woods never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was in a great location in the city right down the block to Millennium Park , the staff in the club lounge remembered our names on sight and what an amazing view of the Lake and city . We enjoyed the couch right under the window with the exceptional view of the lake and park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the location , the view , the amenities , and the friendly and pro ##mpt service . Their pool was out of service , which was a b ##um ##mer , but not big deal . I ’ d love to stay there again . Staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel All ##egro in Chicago is a beautiful hotel . Service was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Wine receptions was very pleasant and relaxing in their beautiful lobby . P ##lent ##y of places to sit and visit . Room was fairly spacious and beds comfortable . Will go again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was great , Shopping is within walking distance . The room was clean and very friendly staff . The restaurant at the hotel was lovely but noise . The Library Bar is fantastic and must nice ##r to have the dinner at the Bar [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel lacks attention to detail . Coffee is not re ##fill ##ed and toilet ##ries are left missing . Diamond members are treated as regular guests . If you want luxury , try the London House or the W ##it , This hotel under performs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I generally stay at another Hilton property approximately 3 blocks away . However , in December the rates were attractive and we decided to stay at the Conrad . The staff could not have been more friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . From the v ##alet to the bar staff , all were outstanding . The room was very modern and comfortable . Nice thing the room was extremely quite from both outside noises and interior noise . The location is just off of Michigan Ave and Rush street so you are close to tons of shopping and restaurants . The only negative is if you want to catch the " L " you need to walk a few blocks . Overall , this is wonderful hotel and is a delight to stay in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All personal at the breakfast are very low trained persons . Even the basic ##s are unknown . No good morning , no friend ##liness , no correct behavior at the dishes , no thank you , no eye contact and so on and so on . The Breakfast itself is very nice . The Hotel is also very nice , the Room ##s are large and clean . The Location is perfect . Te ##mper ##at ##ur is ok . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So cool to find a hotel with with great views of the river from window seats in the rooms . Staff very friendly and helpful , loved having a makeup mirror in the bathroom . Bed very com ##fy , and location is great for the Ma ##g Mile . Would absolutely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just one word . . . . Excellent ! Everything was great . Thank you . I was there for a four day meeting and the staff was fantastic . Everything was sea ##m ##less . I would highly recommend The O ##m ##ni for a couples stay or a meeting . The location is perfect , right on Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service Great ! ! ! Matt ##resses not comfortable . Location Perfect . Con ##cier ##ge so helpful planning our daily sight seeing trips . Noise in room at night very loud . Heard all street traffic . Would stay again , but would want to make sure they have bought new mattress ##es and would not get a corner room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is quite comfortable and well located within walking distance of many good restaurants , businesses and sites . The rooms are clean and the staff are polite and very helpful . One q ##ui ##bble , lighting in the room could be a little better , but that ' s a matter of personal preference . I recommend Hilton Chicago to any business travel ##ler . [SEP]
1	[CLS] More of a business hotel than a family one . Park ##ing location was it easy to find ( it could be because we were from out of town ) . No water fountain in the lobby or on any floor . Custom ##er service was average . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second stay at the Palmer House for a wedding . It is external ##ly a beautiful hotel , downtown Chicago in the heart of the city . Beautiful main hall , ceilings , and de ##cor . Room ##s are awful however . Out ##dated , tiny , poorly working shower / f ##au ##ce ##t , no ventilation , it just felt old and dated . I am not sure if its the room that we got , or the hotel itself . However , just over ##p ##rice ##d and poor value for the sleeping conditions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place for a meeting or for Fun . Had a business meeting all week and then stayed for fun . Staff were professional and friendly and just amazing with the team and for myself personally . The hotel was clean and lovely - great room . The restaurant was R ##EA ##LL ##Y GO ##OD [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was must ##y and had a strong odor . Way over priced for the quality of the room . The de ##cor seemed out ##dated and very under ##w ##hel ##ming . The restaurant was decent and the 20th floor lobby provided privacy . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff at this hotel did an excellent job taking care of me and my travel items . Very friendly and helpful ! This hotel is a great value and in an excellent location for access to downtown Chicago and surroundings . I recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a cost effective place to stay in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d this hotel . Had not heard of it before . The location is great , service is outstanding . Room ##s bigger than I expected and nicely updated . I would definitely stay here again next time I am in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The kn ##icker ##bo ##cker has a great location we walked to the pan ##cake house a few blocks down and had su ##shi at the mi ##rai nearby . The staff at the breakfast lobby though is super sour and un ##sm ##iling and so are some of the front desk but the bell ##men and con ##cier ##ge are really cheerful and helpful : ) I would stay there again ! [SEP]

[SEP]
0	[CLS] An old and faithful hotel . Next to Buddy guys legend and next to almost everything that matters in Chicago if you don ’ t bother to walk a couple of miles . The restaurant , although not price ##y , is not cheap for the not so good food it offers . Another annoyance is that , after doing check out , if you have to store your luggage , you have to take it outside . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed at the Ambassador while exhibiting an art show in Chicago . Travis made me feel right at home and comfortable in the L ##O ##FT room suggested . Love ##d the design and look forward to future stays when in Chicago . Would def ##inate ##ly return and suggest the Ambassador to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Chicago . 5 / 5 experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I tag along whenever my husband has a conference here . I love everything about this hotel . The rooms and big and quiet . Their black out shades are state of the art . The 67 ##6 restaurant / bar has excellent food and views . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . The food was excellent from room service to the 24 hour market . Location was good and had great access to many sight seeing destinations . I would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and comfortable , l ##ux rooms . The beds are amazing . The rooms are large and well appointed . The restaurant is located with windows looking up and down Michigan Ave . We enjoyed our stay and can easily , highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel with a good location next to the river and not far from the lake . Room ##s are clean with everything in good working order . Strong internet . Help ##ful customer service . Very ta ##sty deep dish pizza at the Big Bar . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very poor customer service provided by staff members at the desk . They are un ##friend ##ly and sometimes quite rude . The breakfast is expensive and not worth it . Room ##s are ok , nothing special . The only good thing about this place is the location . If you ' re visiting Chicago I would recommend somewhere different to stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had the most wonderful , and relaxing stay at the Hilton Chicago . Everyone on the staff were always willing to go the little extra out of their way to ensure we had a f ##abulous stay . For example , Jessica the tour guide for the historic hotel walking tour was amazing and knowledge ##able about the hotel ’ s rich Chicago history . She went completely out of her way and took us up to the executive suites at the very top of the hotel with the amazing views over the park and lake ! Quite the highlight ! High ##ly recommend staying here to all , you won ##t be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The am ##bie ##nce of the Hotel is good and the room well maintained . The location is well central which allows easy access within the downtown environment . Although , a request was made for warming of food item which was not forthcoming . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a nice hotel for a convention . It does however lack a good rest ##ura ##nt for breakfast and or lunch . Shu ##la ’ s is a great place to eat for dinner in the hotel . The staff is friendly and at ##ten ##tive . Well located and try to get a river view room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment I was greeted at the door to the moment I left I was treated like a King , everything was above and beyond , the neighborhood was great , most everything within walking distance and not far from the El , will stay there every time I ’ m in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] The mattress was horrible , it killed my back . Bath ##room maintenance was lacking . House ##keeping attempted to flush a large amount of toilet tissue and someone else ' s hair and c ##log ##ged the toilet . No one told me about it and I received a unpleasant surprise when I returned to my room in the afternoon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location near river and can see lake from hotel . Very near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , five - seven minute walk to Millennium Park , near by other big hotels . Nice spacious room , with all amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is not a 4 . 5 star hotel . If they were not on Michigan Avenue they would be out of business . No room service offered , staff not helpful . Room ##s ok nothing special . Vale ##t and hotel parking doesn ’ t having working charging stations for electric vehicles and Eva admitted they have known for over a month . There is so many great places to stay in Chicago I would recommend staying at another hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The difference between good and excellent is the attention to details . The hotel is very attractive . The lobby is appealing and well appointed . The staff is friendly . The elevators are modern floor specific . The room was clean . The details missed are things like the safe in the room was broken and apparently had been for awhile . The in room coffee maker was on a shelf that was not easily accessible . It had to be removed and set up in the bathroom . A little more attention to details will change a good rating to an excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an event at the Swiss ##ote ##l last week and it could not have gone more smooth . All of the pre - planning for the event , as well as on ##site , everyone was very pro ##active and quite helpful . I look forward to bringing another group back to this property ! It was perfect for the corporate event setting , but also would be great a leisure and really in a perfect spot in the city . Thank you again , Swiss ##ote ##l ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location right at Chicago river . The rooms are a little s ##hady , small and not much has been made , beds too soft for my taste . Staff on other side is helpful , friendly and service good . Didn ' t clean room at first day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3rd floor near the elevators and ice machine and no view . Door men are more like door posts . They see you coming but if you don ' t look rich and famous don ' t think they ’ re going got help you with the doors . No they ’ d rather sit and chat amongst each other . And they ’ re very nice and charming when you get there , but once you ' re there you ’ re on your own . Hotel gym is not what I would expect from a 4 / 5 star hotel . Li ##teral ##ly ripped up mat ##s like rats g ##na ##wed at them , t ##read ##mill s ##week ##ed like crazy , yoga mat ##s were dirty and there was no water or fruit that were suppose to be available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super fast elevators , quick check in , and clean room . Had a nice view of the river and enjoyed the walk across the river each day . Fitness room was small so I went for a run along the lake instead . Didn ' t try the hotel bar or restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in a very good location close to attractions and very walk ##able . The hotel is super clean and staff is incredibly helpful . I did not eat there but would if I had stayed longer ( was just there for a night for business ) . My one bedroom room felt like a suite ! Use U ##ber / L ##y ##ft as cab ##s can get backed up if lots of folks are checking out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked two rooms many months in advance for Memorial Weekend . We had specifically requested 2 queen ##s in both rooms but somehow a mistake was made and with them fully booked , we were stuck with a roll ##away . One of the rooms did have some p ##lum ##bing and blind ##s issues . I felt the staff tried their best to resolve but seemed overwhelmed with how to manage this first busy weekend . The door ##man was really friendly and stuck with me the 3 days we were in / out of the hotel . Great location by the high end shopping area and steps from Michigan Ave . A Star ##bu ##cks is across the street . There is no v ##alet parking and I discovered a website called Spot ##her ##o that was half the price that offer two places just a few minutes walk from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic views of the city . Prime location . Very friendly staff . Good beer selection and cocktail ##s for that quick drink before going out . Good coffee . Overall a great place to stay during our visit to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el is one of my company ' s approved hotels when traveling to Chicago which made me S ##O H ##AP ##P ##Y on a recent business trip . This hotel was top notch from the friendly and at ##ten ##tive staff to the quiet and comfortable room to the amazing ##ly co ##zy bed . Lots of great places to eat and shop nearby . I ' ll definitely be staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago is an amazing hotel . Our room was spacious , comfortable and extremely clean . We had an updated corner room which was directly overlooking the river below and on Wednesday night provided an amazing view of the Navy Pier Fire ##works which go off every Wednesday and Saturday evening during the summer . The hotel is perfectly located whether you are travelling for business or pleasure and it is within walking distance to all of Chicago ’ s attractions . I would highly recommend this hotel to all my family , friends and colleges who would be travelling to Chicago . I will def ##iant ##ly stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff went the extra mile to help deliver a special c ##ele ##bra ##tory gift to my friend who recently el ##oped and stayed at the Ambassador Chicago . Their attention to detail and eager ##ness to help really made my friends day special , allowing me to be a part of their special day when I couldn ' t be there in person . Big thank you to B ##re , Matt , Jacob and the entire front office team ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel ! Came here for the Cubs Convention . It is really nice in here ! The ballroom conference rooms are super big . In a great location with so much around in the heart of Chicago . I had a great time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great hotel ! We have Stay ##ed here many times , and never have left disappointed . If you stay here , you have to try a ma ##rt ##ini in the ma ##rt ##ini bar . Well worth it ! Will be back ! The location also can ’ t be beat ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel is in the heart of downtown Chicago , great place to stay but don ' t bring a car . Park ##ing is very expensive if you ' re not used to paying $ 50 - 65 per night . You can ' t beat the hotel ' s location , there is shopping and restaurants all around . Bring your walking shoes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco is probably a very good hotel , b ##ur suffers in comparison to other Kim ##pton experiences I have had . I am an Inner Circle member , meaning I stay in a lot of Kim ##pton ' s . I do so because of the upgrades , the exceptional service , the welcome treats and bottles of wine , the turn down , not having to fetch my own ice - okay , I ' m a princess , but if you travel a lot being a princess helps and that ' s why I choose Kim ##pton , but it doesn ' t work at the Chicago Monaco . No turn down service , no ice , no welcome am ##eni ##ty . I should have gone to the Burn ##ham or the All ##egro or ( gasp ) the Hilton . I guess they don ' t need to build loyalty here . . . they must get enough business without the Kim ##pton regular ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Above & beyond 5 stars hotel ! Great structure so you will get great views from any room . Spa ##cious room lots of glass windows so you can get city & river view ! Room ##s are clean ! Great big L ##G TV , nice com ##fy bed . Co ##mple ##mentary tea and coffee provided . Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tor & safe deposit box in the room . Both Show ##er and bath ##tub ! Staff ##s are very friendly and welcoming ! ! ! Walking distance to all restaurants and bars . Great place for Outdoor River ##walk , j ##og ##ging ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Just from personal experience I didn ' t like it . I ##m sure that there is a reason for everything but I wasn ' t pleased most of all with the customer service . And getting to the front desk was different as well . But don ' t take my word you won ' t know unless you go yourself [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Palmer House is gorgeous and so convenient to E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING ! ! ! The staff is super friendly ; the rooms are quiet ; its within walking distance to so many places ! ! At Christmas its so beautiful in and around the hotel ! ! ! I highly recommend ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , staff is great especially the gentlemen in front of hotel . The Star ##bu ##cks crew were a little rude . Clean and well maintained hotel . Room ##s were very clean and spacious . My only complaint , as with all hotels , walls didn ’ t do a lot on noise reduction from other rooms and outside . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great little find ! The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in in " The Loop " making it central to many attractions . It was an easy and interesting walk along the river to Navy Pier and a short walk to Millennium Park . The staff were lovely and a good breakfast was included . They had past ##ries and bag ##els , fruit , yo ##gh ##urt , cereal ##s and cheese ! Also included was a drink with ni ##bble ##s at their on ##site lounge . Would definitely stay here again when I ' m Chicago and recommend to friends should they visit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very odd Lo ##bby on 20th floor but a wonderful new , modern , clean hotel ! I ##dea ##l location for Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping . R ##oof ##top bar is great place to catch sunset & view of city spring - fall . Restaurant had good food & service for both dinner & breakfast . The only negative was not staying here for our entire trip . We W ##IL ##L be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived about 30 minutes after check - in time and were told the room was not ready . I was not happy ! We were told it would be about a 15 minute wait . After 15 minutes I asked if we could get com ##ped for drinks at the bar while we waited . We were given a credit to use . while at the bar on my second drink , we were finally told our room was ready . You only get one chance to make a first impression and the Conrad failed mi ##ser ##ably ! The room was very nice , but a bit too cute with the hard to read light buttons ( not light switches ) . Also there was no bill under the door in the morning so we had to endure another trip to the desk to check out . Won ' t stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location on the river ! Beautiful hotel ! Walking distance to multiple activities , shopping and work class restaurants . The bar and restaurant were excellent ! Conference rooms were comfortable and well equipped . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hello , The hotel was nice , the check ##in people were actually very nice also . However , when i called for a pillow that was harder because I have severe back and neck problems and the pillow was so soft I was very rude ##ly told no we don ##t do that like i was crazy . I have stayed at hundreds of hotels and this is a very common thing . The room was also nice , the main issue was just that . I was up all night for both nights with severe pain and have been going for treatments to make up for it for the last week . I know to most of you it is a minor ni ##t ##pic ##k , and the place is very nice . But just very disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent facilities , I particularly enjoyed the fitness center ! Staff is friendly and it ' s a great location , with easy walking distance to bars and restaurants . I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly to anyone planning a trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was great , but it would have been nice to have water ( Crystal G ##ey ##ser will do ) in the room , instead of 6 . 00 a bottle . How about cardboard holders for the hot coffee mug ##s . And , you gave us a choice of 1 de ##ca ##f , 1 tea , and 1 regular coffee . What if we would like 2 de ##ca ##fs ? At 240 . 00 a night , you could come up with a few more amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were spacious and very clean . The view of the River and Lake was perfect . It was close to many great shops and restaurants . The food they served for our meetings was delicious and great variety . . Would recommend and will be back again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a shirt 3 day city break and loved it . The room was spacious , and clean ##liness was superb . The desk staff were pleasant and helpful . A special thanks to John , one of the v ##alet parking guys , who was so helpful and inform ##ative of local knowledge and recommend ##ing places to see . We couldn ' t fault this place . We stayed when it was bitterly cold , snow ##y and we loved the whole experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] Care ##ful if they offer the 16th floor suite upgrade . Make sure both elevators are in service . I think they trick ##ed me and it sucked ! ! ! Bar staff on Sunday hated each other which made for a really uncomfortable attempt to get hot water for tea after waiting 20 minutes for the hot water di ##spense ##r in the lobby to be re ##fill ##ed . We really did loose hours over the course of the weekend just getting up to our room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] David He ##ffer ##nan is the nice ##st manager ! He really went above and beyond to ensure that we had a great family b ##day weekend . He gave our family great rooms and we loved using the lounge with snack ##s . Being Star ##wood gold elite we stay loyal to our Mar ##riot ##t / Star ##wood brand and it really reinforce ##s our desire to do so when we are treated so well ! Good location . Only comment is that u ##ber and l ##y ##ft seem to have a hard time finding the hotel , so just grab a cab ! ! We will be back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I never really had a reason to talk to the morning staff but the evening staff was amazing and always went above and beyond to help answer my questions , and take care of my needs . Antonio at the door is great with giving directions , and Ph ##yl ##ici ##a was always helpful at finding me some electrical tape for my f ##ray ##ed charge ##r and had some great restaurant recommendations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights . Staff in restaurants and bar were at ##ten ##tive and happy . Our room was quiet and the bed was comfortable . Bath ##room was large , but dated . It is very close to the Art institute and downtown attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect ##ly situated near anything you could need - walk to the Loop , Art Museum , shopping on Michigan Ave , Grant Park , etc . The hotel is clean , with great service . We always stay on the Gold floors - compliment ##ary breakfast , afternoon snack ##s , dessert and your own con ##cier ##ge . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Home ##wood Suite ##s on E Grand is an E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##T Location . I highly recommend staying at this hotel . It was walking distance to Navy Pier , Cathedral , Eat ##aly , Willis Tower , etc . The staff was very friendly and the room was very clean . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast b ##uff ##et was also very good . If I had to say 1 thing that was a little annoying it was the elevators . There are 2 elevators but not both are in service at all times . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We couldn ’ t have asked for more from our stay at this hotel . The room was s ##ty ##lish ##y furnished and decorated and the finish was of a high quality . The bed and bed ##ding provided the best comfort and sleeping experience . Nothing was too much trouble for the extremely friendly staff . The menu was small , but everything we had was delicious . The fitness room was adequate for a morning work ##out and there was a great juice bar right next door . A convenient location for supermarket ##s , shopping , site seeing and about 20 min walk to Lake Michigan . I cannot wait to stay at this hotel , which I would highly recommend to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , walking distance to everything we wanted to see . Very pleasant staff . Our room was large and clean . We faced Michigan Avenue , which was nice , but there were a lot of ambulance ##s during the night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was an awesome birthday get ##away . The staff from v ##alet , reception , restaurant were top notch . I would highly recommend the Conrad . The location is walk ##able if you would like to see downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Average hotel in need of a re ##fu ##rb . Fu ##rn ##iture in bedroom really dated . Either from the 1970s or 1980s . When the dinner menu shows fish based meals are ve ##get ##arian , we should have left and gone elsewhere . Too tired so didn ’ t - big mistake . When you tell the waiter that you are ve ##get ##arian and order a salad , to which he asks “ would you like meat on that ” you know that you made a big mistake . Sal ##ad was edible ( just ) but give me the Olive Garden version any day . Key lime pie was thick , s ##to ##d ##gy and to be avoided . No repeat visit for us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The ladies enjoyed their stay , the rooms were clean and well organized . The conference well attended and a lot of des ##ci ##p ##line in all areas . The Hotel staff right from the entrance is wonderful with a lot of respect . The welcome inside is awesome , to the registry all is well until entering the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bathroom was non - functional , and I don ' t care of every other hotel on the block charges $ 4 for a small can of p ##ring ##les it doesn ' t make it right . Charge me $ 4 more for the room , just don ' t make it obvious that you are going to screw for a snack . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A Wonderful Stay Fantastic Food & Be ##ver ##age & The Staff Is Over The Top to make the stay special the lounge is beautiful great service nice fireplace the views from the the prestige suites are awesome . the stores to shop at are great the restaurant and entertainment is in close proximity [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an older hotel with smaller rooms , balanced by a funk ##y character throughout . Lots of great touches such as an evening a ##per ##iti ##f hour included . Great , welcoming lobby which is used by the guests . There are fun touches everywhere . The location is ideal to get everywhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel the third week of April on a business trip . Regis ##tration was easy and the staff was court ##eous and helpful . There was a continental b ##uff ##et in the lobby of each floor each morning which was well stock ##ed with bread ##s , cereal ##s , fruit , juice ##s and coffee and tea . I would stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie again anytime . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice experience in a bout ##ique hotel . Excellent location . We walked everywhere . Room ##s were room ##y , marginal view from windows ! Nice to have power breakfast available to take with us . Quiet hotel despite being in middle of city . Nice to have compliment ##ary coffee in the morning as there is no coffee ion the room . Staff worked di ##ligent ##ly to accommodate our 22 person party . We would definitely stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed four nights for an in - hotel convention . Room was clean and comfortable . The ballroom is classic , worth a peek . Con ##cier ##ge service works as one would expect . Central to most things one would want to see in downtown Chicago . I walked , but I would expect taxi service would be cheap due to the moderate distances involved . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel personnel were extremely helpful and friendly . Fitness center was nice . Room ##s were clean and bed was comfortable . I would stay there again . It is close to the theater district so is very convenient if you are going to a concert or show . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked the hotel for two nights through Ex ##ped ##ia , hotel is in bad shape , beds are small , rooms are dirty and have mold ##y smell , walls are thin , lot of noise in hallway ##s . We called Ex ##ped ##ia to check out one day early , they directed us to front desk who refused to give us re ##fu ##nd , front desk and manager were extremely rude and declined to cancel the reservation . This is the worst experience I had in a hotel . Stay away from this property and pay extra money and stay at a decent place . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Some of my family stayed here while they were visiting from out of state , and they had a wonderful stay . The staff were professional and court ##eous , and checked in my family swiftly and with no problems . The rooms were spacious and the beds were quite comfortable , and room service was pro ##mpt and accurate . The location is great , right in downtown Chicago near the Loop and several amenities ( restaurants , museums , shopping , etc . ) . Some rooms offer a beautiful view of the lake , while others offer a great city view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is beautifully appointed , well located and extremely customer - experience focused . We enjoyed the pro ##mpt and court ##eous service by every hotel staff we encountered and really appreciated the attention to my young granddaughter , who received a milk and cookies delivery each evening . Well done Conrad Hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located and within walking distance to museum district ( 1 . 5 miles ) and shopping ( . 5 miles ) . Lots of good restaurants all within walking distance . Good exercise facilities allow you to keep up your fitness routine . Front desk staff are very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I recently spent 5 nights at the Fair ##mont . It was great . The room was very nice and the location couldn ' t be any better . We walked everywhere right from the hotel . I would really like to compliment the hotel on the staff . We were treated with such kindness from everyone . The staff in the breakfast b ##uff ##et area were all so nice and helpful . I would especially like to thank Susan , the con ##cier ##ge , who was so helpful with all of our dinner plans and getting us tickets and reservations to Chicago events . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this with booking . com the price was a bargain for the location . The hotel over all exceeded our expectations . View was gorgeous and bed com ##fy . Bath ##room was large with a cool shower head . Love ##d the different waters of the day served by the bar . Thanks for a great stay and we will be back . Get location if you are running the s ##ham ##rock s ##hu ##ffle . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Missing the 5 star Intercontinental ex ##per ##in ##ce . Well over ##p ##rice ##d for the service . Staff all seem t ##i be in pain or bad mood . Good : - amazing historic building - well maintained 1920s Olympic pool - great location Bad : - was not greeted as Ambassador member at check - in but directly asked for a credit card , no welcome or hello - rooms are old and well beyond used - did not receive Ambassador welcome letter - was not informed of $ 20 credit for bar and restaurant - did not receive daily in - room water - have asked instant service for Too ##th paste upon a ##ri ##val , it was not sent to my room - the gym / pool host did not provide instructions where is pool , change room etc but just asked if we are staying in this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] I like to come back here because of the position , right near the water towers and the ma ##g mile . The hotel is relatively new and rooms are all perfectly equipped and clean . Our 91 ##7 was very big and rather quiet . The only improvement that I ’ d suggest is to try to have the heating sea stem a bit more quiet ##er [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m in Chicago several times a year for work and hands down , The Conrad is all - around the best hotel I ' ve stayed . The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are sleek , modern with super comfortable beds . Service is top notch and food was great . A five minute walk to Michigan avenue ( if that ) the hotel ' s location can ' t be beat . I seriously didn ' t hear one car horn at night - and it ' s far away from the L - first time I didn ' t need a sound machine to m ##uff ##le city noise . I rarely give ' 5 ' s ' but I can ' t think of anything to din ##g ! Will define ##tly be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time in Chicago and what an amazing and beautiful hotel this place was . We arrived very early for check - in but luck ##ily they had a room available . The hotel was close to many spots within walking distance . Like Mill ##eni ##um Park . Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Chicago River ##walk and a lot more . We had a very nice view from the 29th floor and more importantly the room was very pleasant . The staff was very helpful and the next time I visit Chicago again I will come here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved our stay at the historic Hilton Chicago . The price point made it feasible to bring the entire family . Fantastic location made sights ##ee ##ing simple and it ’ s close to excellent restaurants . The interior of the hotel itself is something to see and the stories and displays of people who had visited just enhanced the experience . Steven ( from Iowa ) was especially helpful as we finished our vacation . He recommended additional Hilton stays that were available from the con ##cier ##ge and other offers available to Hilton Honors members . We look forward to our next trip to the Hilton Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a nice location just off Michigan ( North end ) . It ' s an old hotel with great details to give it charm & character . The staff was friendly and the room were nice . There ' s an on site bar & restaurant , free W ##i ##F ##i and a parking garage across the street ( pay per night ) . My only complaint , and it ' s a pretty big one to me , is climate control . Because of the hotel ' s age , there aren ' t individual climate controls in each room . The hotel is on 1 single heating , cooling system , so I couldn ' t make my room any cooler and it was too warm . The windows do open slightly , but I like to sleep in a cold room , this was not . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l is located near Navy Pier and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Staff is friendly and very helpful , rooms are large and clean and the views are amazing . For the price I paid per night through a search engine it was an excellent value and I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had two small Amazon boxes delivered and actually had to pay money to receive them . Also had to pay $ 25 to work out during my stay ( even as a H ##H ##ono ##rs member ) . When did the Hilton become United Airlines ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] This property in Chicago is lovely and the lobby and bar area are impressive . But , I had a corner room with 2 beds in it and they were double ! They were not even queen beds . It ' s been a long time since I stayed at a hotel with a double bed . For the cost of this hotel there should be no double beds . Also , there are no coffee makers in the room . I was disappointed based on the price I paid . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In ##formed helpful staff , con ##vie ##ntly located , clean . Rob ##es , yoga mat , umbrella provided . No free internet unless you join their " club " . Coffee in the lobby . Both visits there were families celebrating weddings . Wine in the evening , limited hour . B ##ike ##s available . I overheard , no bike storage available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are large and have everything you need . I had a great city view . The front desk staff were very at ##ten ##tive and helpful and I never had to wait in line to be helped . There are lot ' s of places to eat right outside the door . Breakfast is OK - standard past ##ries and sugar ##y cereal ##s - some fresh fruit . Good selection of tea ##s . Will stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ing for a Conrad . Conference rooms are an awkward long shape not con ##du ##ci ##ve for a meeting . She ##ets were worn out , old and pill ##ing terribly . no executive lounge . they ran out of food they were serving to us in the conference , and many of us had to put our dirty plates on the floor in order to work at the tables , because there was no where else to put them in the room . [SEP]

The fridge was stock ##ed with free water . Overall , the room definitely felt like a luxury hotel . The gym was also great with lots of card ##io machines . The only odd thing was the lobby is on the top floor but overall the hotel was great and staff were very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The arrival process went so smooth . . . and we didn ’ t get in until 1 am ! The room service was excellent and we used it at least once a day for convenience and it ’ s quick delivery . I loved our view , the room was fantastic and the key pad used to put our room on private , call for tray pick up , have our room made up , etc . was so nice . They even texted us two different days to see if we needed anything for our room since we had our room on private / do not disturb . We will M ##OS ##T DE ##FI ##NI ##TE ##L ##Y be back again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had a pleasant stay here in early August . But having stayed at Conrad ##s in other parts of the world , I was a bit disappointed in the physical aspects of the Conrad Chicago . The room wasn ' t as luxurious as I expected . No grand lobby to welcome guests . And no pool . But the staff were outstanding and the service was excellent . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Small ##er property that provides great value and exceptional service . The history of the property adds to the experience . The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cher preserved the historical integrity of the building without sa ##c ##ri ##fic ##ing comfort and convenience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I do love Kim ##pton hotels . They all have the same friendly v ##ibe but not the chain feeling . I was greeted by their super friendly staff when I walked in . And went to a nice sized King room . Was able to have dinner and breakfast at the restaurant downstairs which was fast and very ta ##sty . They offer yoga mat ##s in each of the rooms and their is a fitness center on ##site [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came into Chicago for an extended weekend . I ' ve never s ##p ##lu ##rge ##d before on a hotel in the heart of the Miracle Mile . I ' m so glad that I did .

1	[CLS] The hotel was very clean the room was outstanding very big and clean the staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting the staff looks who you are when you first enter the hotel to see if you belong there or not . The restaurant food . h ##ss top quality the o ##ct ##opus and New . York strip steak was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at The Ki ##nz ##ie to attend a White Sox game one night and Hamilton on the next night and we loved it . The location was great and the staff was extremely helpful . Breakfast was just right and we were able to make it to Happy Hour for some wine on both nights before heading out . The walk to the theater only took about 15 minutes . We also walked down by the river one day and to Navy Pier on another day . I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I usually stay at this hotel for a conference at the congress center . Year after year it is consistently good . Room ##s are spacious and clean . Really comfortable bed . Location is excellent . Bar restaurant has a great menu . The pool and gym fantastic . Worth the extra cost . I will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Right on the mile but quiet . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms and very friendly staff . Will definitely come back on future trips to Chicago . They made the room available to us by 11 am even though the check in time is 3 pm which was great service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good Location , Great Room . Check in & Check out was efficient and room was ready on arrival . Really easy to get around the city and was close to many eat ##eries and shopping ( if you like that sort of thing ! ) Li ##fts a bit slow and Breakfast was expensive [SEP]

[SEP]
1	[CLS] Old world grand ##eur with the quiet solid brick charm amidst the g ##list ##ening glass boxes in the distance . Steps from the Buckingham fountain and literally a few more t ##rots to the beach shore with navy pier on the left and planet ##arium on the right . Staff very helpful at ##ten ##tive respond re ##lia ##bly on a Sunday afternoon . Use AAA park n save to save on parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two nights here with spouse on a weekend trip to Chicago . Stay ##ed in the West Tower which I recommend to avoid the crowds of the lobby . Had lounge access with our H ##ya ##tt status . Breakfast was enough to keep us going until lunch . Evening snack ##s adequate . “ Honor bar ” for alcoholic drinks seems a little cheap when you consider how much we ’ ve spent at H ##ya ##tt to achieve the status we have . Co ##m ##fort ##able room , lovely views of the river out towards the Lake . Very quiet . Good towels and linen ##s . Easy walk to bus stop , a 10 minute walk to the El , and a great base to explore the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel in a great location right on Michigan Ave . Great service , clean rooms and best part is when you walk out the front doors you are in the middle of the action on Michigan Ave . We have to recognize Hussein the v ##alet who was truly a pleasure to meet and makes a great first impression when visiting the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is an old hotel , well maintained . My standard room was quite adequate and comfortable . Hotel services efficient and friendly . Location superb . A special note : the breakfast rush in the restaurant may be da ##unting . However , there is a b ##uff ##et most people order . Don ' t skip breakfast ! If you do , you will miss one of the nice ##st waiter ##s I have ever met . [SEP]

I will definitely be going back soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just stayed at the Monaco Hotel in Chicago for 2 nights for a Mom / Daughter shopping , touring , eating , and entertainment few days . We upgraded to the top floor with a " river view " . It was totally worth it . Sitting in the window seats looking out over the river was amazing . We loved our oversized room with the animal print robes . The wine hour in the evening , the Hot Co ##coa during the day and coffee and tea in the morning were just a few a the reasons we love Kim ##pton Hotels . The staff is very at ##ten ##tive , from the door ##man , to the front desk person . The con ##cier ##ge also helped us ahead of time to set up a few dinner reservations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , good location for for the northern side of the river but also easy access to the loop if you want to walk or get a cab or use the free troll ##y near Michigan Avenue . Best pizza in Chicago on State Street just west of the hotel : Pi ##zano ' s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent stay . Very clean and co ##zy . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful . The one thing that I will say is that it takes a few trips to get adjusted with how big the hotel is . Other than that , great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently re ##mo ##del ##ed hotel in central location for downtown Chicago . Help ##ful staff ( gave good directions for the red line ! ) , good breakfast . Large comfortable room with great kitchen area . We will stay here again I ' m sure . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ambassador Chicago never fails to meet the mark ! A great stay as always ! ! Staff is always friendly and helpful . Our room was very clean and nicely appointed . Travis H . is wonderful and a huge asset to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk was friendly . The rooms had Ku ##rig coffee pod ##s and we constantly had to request for more coffee . Nice bar downstairs and the drinks were fairly priced . The bartender ##s even handed out crisp ##s for us to snack on . There were a couple wedding parties and the lobby can be noisy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a king room through hot ##wire . Upon arrival around noon , well before the 3 or 4 pm check - in , the very nice man at the reception desk said he didn ' t have a king bed but could put us in a double room on the 22nd floor facing the river . It was A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E ! ! The room had been updated ( I ready MA ##N ##Y complaints on Trip ##A ##d ##visor about rooms at this hotel needing update but not ours ! ) and the beds were very comfortable and what a view we had ! The location simply could not be better , and we ' ve stayed all over downtown Chicago over the years . I ' d love to stay there again anytime ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here while attending the Defense Credit Union Council conference & was blown away by the quality of service & excellence in the accommodation ##s , location & meeting rooms ! This is a place I ’ d probably return for personal recreation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was very helpful with my needs and replied immediately to my text . Room ##s are clean and spacious with large bathroom ##s that include a separate tub and shower . Mini ##bar was stock ##ed and there was a coffee maker and hair dry ##er . Downs ##tai ##rs has a full service restaurant and we ordered room service for dinner . Very good food . I highly recommend trying the restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here the weekend of the marathon . A ##rri ##ved at 8 : 30 to first wait 20 minutes to get to the front desk , and then told that rooms were not yet available ? At 8 : 30 pm ? Come on . End ##ed up leaving luggage and heading out for dinner . Got back by 11 : 00 and room was finally ready . No offer of compensation , which at almost $ 300 CA ##D a night ( after taxes etc ) , you ' d expect your room to be ready when you arrived . Room itself was nice , no couch , but desk with a desktop computer ( weird that the monitor turned on automatically about 2 : 00 a . m . ) Co ##m ##fy bed , quiet , and nicely renovated bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful room on the 22nd floor with view of millennium park and lake Michigan . Great staff in the gold lounge . Special thanks to Cody , Mu ##gi and Man ##dan ##a for taking so good care of us . Very nice breakfast b ##uff ##et with a good selection of dishes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first trip to Chicago . Two mom ##s with our 11 year old daughters to see Hamilton and a little site seeing . The staff here were wonderful . The door gentlemen went above and beyond and you could tell that they remembered us during out time their . They helped everyone get in and out of their cab ##s / u ##bers / lifts and kept the car and pedestrian traffic running smoothly . They answered any and all questions . We were there for 3 nights and 4 days . It was a nice start and ending to our days to be greeted by them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was the second time that I stayed at this hotel and enjoyed both stays . The front desk was very helpful and the hotel is clean and rooms are large . The restaurant is always crowded and the bar area was active late at night . There are many very nice restaurants in walking distance and Michigan Ave is only a few blocks away as well as the John Hancock B ##ld ##g . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On arriving at the hotel was greeted by the bell ##boy " Perry " who went out of his way to be helpful in every way . Even shared his local knowledge of the area which turned out to be very useful . On arriving at reception they did not have any record of our booking being paid for , even though it had all been arranged as a package tour , but they were very understanding and helpful and gave us a room even though no record of payment had been made . We are home now and am sure it has now been sorted out . But thanks again to the reception staff [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the minute you arrive , you are greeted by a member of the friendly professional staff and escorted into the lobby , where Michael and the rest of the front desk staff check you in and make you feel right at home . The rooms are very nice with a bed that will knock you out for the count . Upper floors provide some nice views of the surrounding area and the lake . Located near everything , with high end shopping , great food , the beach , public transportation , and Michigan Avenue just a few blocks away , High ##ly recommend , and will definitely stay here again . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed my stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . The hotel is lovely and is in a great location , easy to find , and not far from public transportation . For a large city the street was very quiet and we heard little / no outside noise in the room . One staff member stood out as being particularly friendly and helpful at both check - in and another time at the con ##cier ##ge desk . I believe his name was Henry . He was very nice , persona ##ble and very knowledge ##able about Chicago . He patiently answered all of our questions about sights ##ee ##ing and directions to various locations . The restaurant in the lobby was also convenient and the food was good . The breakfast b ##uff ##et on the weekend was a nice option . I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again when visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a solid 4 star property . The location is excellent for sights ##ee ##ing in Chicago . The staff are very warm and a ##cco ##mo ##dating . We stayed in a very large one bedroom suite . There was plenty of room for myself and 3 kids . We also had access to the Gold Lounge , which had great food , snack ##s . My kids enjoyed the comfortable space and board games . Sharon and Mu ##ji were especially pleasant . We had a good rate for our room so it was a good value . The only minus was that our room needed some maintenance - beat up doors and missing trim in the bathroom . This is a solid 4 star property . A step up above a mid ##rang ##e property but not a 5 star . Overall an excellent stay [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment we pulled up and were greeted by the v ##alet we were extremely impressed . By far the most beautiful hotel , with the most imp ##ec ##ca ##ble service , we have ever stayed at . The rooms were so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting with state of the art features . Our family had a surprise party and the area reserved for the event was a perfect balance of comfortable and class ##y , and the servers were professional and very pleasant . And the food was amazing ! We will not stop talking about this experience to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No real complaints about the kn ##icker ##bo ##cker aside that the room was very small . The bed was V ##ER ##Y comfortable , the bathroom was clean and nice , service was good . Hotel itself was clean , although very old it was def ##iant ##ly taken care of and well loved . We loved the character of the lobby , the small elevators and the main lobby . Would def ##iant ##ly stay here again if we stayed in the downtown core . Good location also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a few days . The room was very comfortable and clean . The hotel staff were also nice and helpful . There is quick room service and complementary cup of coffee in the morning . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time to Chicago . The Ambassador was recommended by my sister who has stayed there many times . We loved the neighborhood . Lots of great shopping and restaurants . The staff were always helpful and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Heat ##er was as and maintenance did not fix it when came in before we left to go out . Not fixed when got back . Bad night ’ s sleep . Room very small . Pi ##llow ##s had little support . The continental breakfast was $ 20 so we went elsewhere . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am a frequent travel ##er and She ##rato ##n Grand is my SP ##G hotel of choice in Chicago . While I have frequented this hotel , on this particular stay , I experienced a level of service that is unique . Eric at the front desk greeted me and remembered that the last time I checked in there was a problem . Now while I did not remember the situation , I appreciated his a ##ck ##no ##wl ##ed ##gment and his special handling of my check - in to ensure everything went smoothly . He also looked at my room preferences in my profile and suggested some changes . This kind of warmth and at ##ten ##tive ##ness was much appreciated . As a side note , I love this hotel as it is a comfortable walking distance to great restaurants and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my overnight stay at the So ##fit ##el . Staff was at ##ten ##tive , helpful and court ##eous . My room was clean , comfortable and spacious for one . I found the bed was particularly comfortable and the central location was convenient . This location was consistent with other So ##fit ##el properties I have stayed in . Re ##com ##men ##ded without reservations [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has a good location and great conference space . But the rooms are small , have bad lighting and aren ' t very clean . They are run down . There is a lot potential but they are missing the mark . The photo of the closet door was after I had already cleaned it with a wet wipe I had . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice views with easy access to River ##walk and Mill ##eni ##um Park . Room was updated and very clean . Bed ##s were comfortable . Would have liked daily house ##keeping but we were told it was not available . Staff was friendly and helpful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Located in Chicago ’ s Gold Coast Historic District just steps from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile on Michigan Avenue , the Talbot ##t Hotel has been newly renovated and offers time ##less modern architecture , well appointed yet comfortable d ##é ##cor and exceptional customer service . 20 East provides a creative menu featuring quality - driven American fare with a bar serving craft beers , wines , and cu ##linary cocktail ##s that pair perfectly with the cuisine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chicago & H ##ya ##tt helped us get a fresh start on the school year . This location is within walking distance to parks , eat ##eries , entertainment if you feel the need to leave . It has many sitting re ##cha ##rg ##ing stations . A true home away from home ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got stuck in Chicago due to flying challenges . Book ##ed a stay at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker via Hotel Tonight . The front desk needed a Man ##ger to confirm the reservation , but once that was done . W ##OW ! Usually happy with Hotel Tonight and Millennium , but this was amazing . K ##wa ##me at the front desk was spectacular . Great big room compared to other Hotel Tonight experiences . A suite ! Help ##ed me with W ##i ##F ##i and was overall quick , court ##eous , and kind . Looking forward to returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay at the Ambassador . It was great for a young couple , but we saw families and people of all ages here enjoying their stay . Modern / simple de ##cor with l ##uxe v ##ibes . Location is central to many restaurants and shops , as well as the lake ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good sized - room ( 2 double beds ) . Stay ##ed with wife and 12 ##yo . Breakfast and w ##i - fi are NO ##T standard inclusion ##s so watch the ' great price ' on booking sites . Once you add those this is not a value deal . Location is good , service was friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean room , excellent location , healthy breakfast and good fitness center . The guest service manager is a person that cares about the guest - Thank you . I can recommend the hotel for both business stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel - old building that was newly re ##mo ##del ##ed . Love the old and new comb ##o . I read many comments that complained of the room size - I did not find that issue . We stayed in a queen room on the 6th floor and it was nice sized . It had the bed , a full desk , dresser with t ##v and little sea ##r my area . Social hour was busy and held in gorgeous lobby . Lots of events going on while we were there . Would definitely recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the hotel and it ' s convenient location to Michigan Avenue . The room was nice and the bathroom was especially nice . However , the air condition ##er leaked and the carpet outside of the closet was wet . Otherwise the room was very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is run ##down , the rooms are must ##y . The hair ##dr ##yer got so hot that I could not old it without using a towel . I called for a new one and was told to use cold air to dry my hair . The new hair dry ##er never came up until after I left my room . The shower water did not stay hot and water was coming out of the floor next to the toilet bowl . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker over Thanksgiving weekend . My second time staying at this property and it didn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Co ##m ##fy beds and nice bathroom . Great location right off The Mile . We did tons of walking and it was nice to fall into a com ##fy bed at the end of a busy day ! Our room location was super quiet and we never heard anyone else in the hallway ##s or otherwise . I would definitely return to the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker again . It ' s a nice bout ##ique hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel on the magnificent mile . Very close to the 360 experience and a hop on hop off bus stop . Perfect for my needs . Easy to walk to many attractions Friendly staff , good restaurant / bar and nice comfortable bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a 5 star for the central position in town , but the breakfast was bad with past ##ries and bread cold and absolutely not fresh . The breakfast room is in a close environment without any view outside . I got a room at the second floor with a bad view on a secondary street . The room , however , was good and clean and the service was also good and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our week stay at the Hilton . The con ##cier ##ge service was excellent . Our room was wonderful with a huge bathroom . Couldn ' t ask for more . Was newly renovated . We were close to so much . The Hop on Hop off bus was outside our door . Tax ##i cab ##s were abundant and reasonable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel . Room ##s were very large and clean . It was like a small apartment . Pool was warm . They offer a great evening social complete with drinks and food ( Free ) . Breakfast is also included in the morning . Everyone was very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel ' s location is very convenient . The gym and the bar are very good . What I found to be not adequate was the very small bathroom the room had , and I did not really like the style of the room . But I guess the latter is due to personal taste . Also the halls and the reception were freezing from the super low temperature air conditioning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s a comfortable hotel , a good position near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and the shopping district , not too far from the Loop . Excellent rooms , staff very kind , a very pleasant stay . if I went again in Chicago , I ' d choose the So ##fit ##el . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First of all , check - in is a nightmare . Every time we walked through the small lobby , there was a long line including the time we checked in ourselves . When we attempted to speak with a manager , he walked away while we were speaking to him . The beds are not comfortable . And , the T ##P is the cheap sand ##paper - like stuff you get in a public rest ##room . Seriously ? The best thing going for it is location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very well located close to Michigan avenue and to lots of restaurants . The rooms were great all of them with amazing view , huge bathroom ##s and a very cord ##ial staff . I really felt ##s like the service was very personal ##ized . Good job . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and pleasant . Location is a block from Michigan Ave . and near tons of food . Walking distance from Navy Pier . Hotel was a steal for the price we paid . Only issue was a slight smell in the room , but my family didn ’ t smell what I thought I smelled . The elevator kept breaking which was very in ##con ##ven ##ient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 2 nights at the new Conrad location in Chicago . Can ' t say enough about the quality of the room and furnishings . We were upgraded to a Michigan Avenue view which was nice , and the bathroom was huge - - great shower ! ! Had a quick continental breakfast every morning , which was well served and time ##ly . Nice rooftop bar with comfortable seating and a good not great view of the city . I would definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I knew it was close to Michigan Ave , maps can be de ##cie ##ving . . . but it was real close . For a historic hotel it was is great shape ! ! Staff was very helpful . . . elevator is not very room ##y but it ' s adds to the charm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While this is an attractive building in a good location , there are things that will keep me from going back . # 1 ) parking - if you self park in the Ogden Plaza garage across the street , you are a level below the entrance to the hotel . # 2 ) food - the L ##B B ##ist ##ro & Pat ##isse ##rie is wa ##aa ##y over - priced for what you get . Go outside of the hotel for meals . Staff for the most part is court ##eous and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay at the Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park . The location is very convenient to attractions in downtown Chicago ( the Bean , the Art Institute of Chicago , the Chicago Architectural Boat Tour , the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile etc ) . We upgraded to the Fair ##mont Gold level , which I cannot recommend enough . It includes 24 / 7 gym access , w ##if ##i , and access to the Fair ##mont lounge . The lounge has breakfast , tea , app ##eti ##zers , and dessert ##s every day . The value of all of those amenities combined is well above the additional gold level fee . The entire hotel staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , but the staff in the lounge ( shout ##out to Sharon H and Man ##dan ##a ) were exceptionally at ##ten ##tive . We would definitely recommend the Fair ##mont to future Chicago visitors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the door greeting to the quick check - in and all suite rooms , this is a wonderful property . The staff is friendly , rooms are very clean and have just what you need . The morning beverage service is great . I enjoy the 67 ##6 Bar and restaurant as well . The food and drinks are lovely and the staff friendly . The maid service is consistent and always done well . The views from all rooms are excellent and location perfect for easy access to everything you want to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed our 3 night stay ! Stay ##ed here several years ago and enjoyed the new design and renovations in the building . Room ##s were spacious . The location was walking distance or a short drive away from all the sights we wanted to see . Would definitely stay here again whenever we go back to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my second time at O ##m ##ni Chicago , it is just as wonderful as the first , the king room is really two rooms , sofa and desk in second room . Hotels have all amenities , staff is friendly and the service is great . I have stayed at many hotels in Chicago , this is by far my favorite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont provides top line accommodation ##s at this well - situated downtown Chicago location . We chose the “ Gold Room ” since we had great experiences with it at other Fair ##mont hotels . Beautiful and spacious room with a very nice view . Very modern , clean and quiet . The service was excellent . The Gold Lounge was fantastic with delicious breakfast ##s , snack ##s and other amenities . The lounge provided quiet comfort any time of the day . Mu ##gi and Man ##dan ##a were wonderful Gold con ##cier ##ge professionals who provided friendly service and were there to accommodate your travel and leisure needs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean and well kept with a very friendly staff . On the other hand the room was very hot and there was no way to cool it down and the bathroom was very small with few places to set things and hang towels . Other than that it was a very pleasant experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked on Hot ##wire . It was an incredible value ! Hotel was very clean and service was excellent and friendly . Our room was very s ##pec ##ious for a single king - size bed . Location of hotel was perfect to downtown are and to get to other city locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I will start with the good , the breakfast and evening social during the week were fantastic and the breakfast / evening social staff were extremely friendly and helpful . The bad was both rooms we had contained multiple issues with the bathroom and windows . The tub ##s in both rooms were cracking badly . The second room we had the shower drain was so slow it covered your feet . Our toilet sounded like the little engine that could every time you flushed . Our window would not close for two days . We encountered attitude when we tried to get a new room and still had problems with the second room . They did address the issues when we checked out but room issues caused the stay to not be as enjoyable as it could have been . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 3 nights in this beautiful hotel , upon arrival at home ( to Texas ) I received an email from the Palmer House stating I was charged $ 8 . 70 for a bottle of water . The most f ##rust ##rating part of this is that , after spending over 2 hours just trying to get a person on the phone to help me with this er ##rone ##ous charge , I was not successful . Only transferred to lines where no one answered . If you don ' t mind being overly charged for items not consumed in a beautiful hotel , then this place is for you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended a big conference at the hotel . They do a nice job . The big bar is perfectly placed . A little confusing getting around at times on lower levels with es ##cal ##ators and elevators . Will be back definitely . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We checked in early and were immediately taken care of , our luggage was stored the v ##alet kept our car handy while we checked in and fresh ##ened up . Our room was very comfort ##ible with a great city view , the linen ##s were crisp and the mini bar ready to go ! When we travel we look for Kim ##pton hotels as they never di ##sa ##pp ##oint and this was definitely the case again at the All ##egro We did enjoy one evening in the restaurant with very authentic Italian cuisine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Conrad Chicago back i 2012 and enjoyed it , so we were excited to come back for two nights here in 2019 , and all expectations were met . The hotel has located to a new location ( but still foot ##ste ##ep ##s from Michigan Avenue ) and has been upgraded . The reception is placed at the top ##f ##lo ##or , where check ##in was easy . The best was however the room . A spacious double queen room with a huge 65 inch television , city view and a really spacious and elegant bathroom . Great pillows , comfortable mat ##resses gave a good nights sleep after a 9 ##½ hours flight . Only thing we missed out on was the rooftop bar , which was closed for the season . Too bad , but all in all a very well ##des ##erve ##d 5 stars for the Conrad ( especially also due to the fact that we got the room at a good price ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent place to stay in Chicago downtown area . Location of hotel was ideal for our needs while visiting Chicago . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast was con ##ges ##ted at times and there was not enough silver ##ware and breakfast items available at a ready moment , causing a wait and delay to our scheduled events . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel twice . The first time was for the Cubs Convention . It was the first year the She ##rato ##n was hosting , and we much prefer the Hilton for the convention . I ended up back at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago after booking a blind deal through price ##line . It must say the hotel is much more enjoyable when there aren ' t a million cu ##b fans walking around . Even with the great rate we ended up in a room with a view of navy pier . We walked down in the evening and watched the fireworks from the river . It was a great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is lovely . Good location , peaceful but with the benefits of a city hotel . Great access to restaurants and convenience stores . An old hotel recently renovated . Room ##s fresh and bright following the upgrade . Staff at ##ten ##tive . Overall , a very good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are a little dated and need some T ##LC . Small . But great location . Great pool and meeting rooms . De ##f take some time and explore the hotel and see the history and cool meeting rooms . Also the pool is a must see . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a wonderful place to stay ! The location is te ##rri ##fic , the people are excellent , and the service is superb . The rooms vary a lot from room to room . Some are very small and some have nice views while others look at other rooms . Everyone is very friendly and helpful ! One criticism . . . . the mini - bar is set up with sensors so if a child or anyone moves an item or picks it up to look at it , you are automatically charged for the item . The packaged cookies and can ##dies are right at child level so this becomes a major problem . I think they need another system such as putting these items under a cover or behind a glass door . . . something it keep small hands away . It reminded me of all the items grocery stores put at the check - out stand to en ##tic ##e people . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s always fun to stay at one of these big , downtown hotels with lots of amenities . Location is great , with excellent views of the city , river and W ##rig ##ley B ##ld ##g . The Big Bar on the 2nd floor lobby is one of my favorite places to go in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We received great customer service on our trip and our room had an amazing view ! Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking to stay in the heart of everything . Super close to navy pier and a short walk to millennium park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotels was great , very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , friendly staff , we had a great stay . The location was perfect , food was great , bar ##tending staff was fun . T ##ra ##v made the stay over the top . We would consider staying again the next time we ' re in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over 100 years of charm and grace . Dr ##ink ##s in the cavern ##ous lobby are a must . Food was decent , service was stellar . Many very good restaurants just outside the door . Berg ##hoff is just as good as the places we enjoyed in Germany . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sur ##prise upgrade always makes me happy ! A ##rri ##ved early - s ##to ##wed my luggage and went to my meetings , got back , luggage already in room and I scored an upgrade for being a Gold Hilton Honors guest - refrigerator stacked with water . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was outstanding ! The staff was text ##ing me the day before my arrival to prepare for my arrival . The location is perfect for so many attractions in Chicago . The room was spacious , com ##fy bed and really nice linen ##s . Our room was on Delaware so very quiet . The bar has a nice menu and great service . One of the best hotels I ’ ve ever stayed at . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , walk ##able to many sites , modern and clean rooms . Excellent service and staff including the nicely groom ##ed must ##ache door man who always opens the door with a big smile . I will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent stay . I have already stayed at the Intercontinental Hotels before in Sydney , Australia . The same level of professional ##ism , efficiency exists in all . You have exceeded my expectations . Staff was accessible at all times . I was really impressed on how persona ##ble they were despite this pan ##de ##mic we are facing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel 3 times now , and I really like it central ##ity . Walking distance to the miracle mile , easy access to River South and River North area . Can catch the hop on hop off bus tour right out front of the hotel . Excellent choice . Very cool to also watch the Chicago Marathon as the runners pass right by this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The one thing that stood out to us was the v ##alet ##s for the hotel , two in particular were exceptional and even helped us to our room as I have a disability on multiple occasions . These gentlemen were named James and Sean . They were so kind ! Also the front desk people as well as the restaurant servers picked up on our needs and wants during our stay almost immediately , it was quite as ##ton ##ishing . We really felt that we were being served and well . And to top it off , it is a historical hotel and has the el ##egan ##ce to go along with it . Beautiful historical neighborhood as well with a gorgeous view of Michigan Lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador has been my go to in Chicago for years . The Staff , Cool V ##ibe , and location are hard to beat . Room ##s are larger than most other Chicago hotels . You can walk everywhere with restaurants , bars , and tons of shopping around the corner . They have re - done the gym with all new equipment and runs / walks along beautiful lake Michigan are a must . The bar and work areas are super chill and they make a delicious la ##tte at the cafe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed staying at the hotel , great location to get everywhere in the city . I lost an important book / folder and your employee , Jose Valle , went above and beyond and found the missing item and had it sent to me . Thank you so much ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room , in the older sect ##on of the hotel , was large , with comfortable seating , quiet , great views from a high floor . A lovely room , all the amenities were there and everything worked perfectly . Location near almost - express elevator was a plus , too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay at The Talbot ##t for the weekend . Nice suite . Great little bar and wonderful breakfast . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located . The hotel lobby and the rooms were very clean and quiet with a friendly and competent staff . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved how the staff help us with our self park issue and made it better and simpler for us . The room was great and I have no words to describe it . My fi ##ance and I will definitely be staying in this hotel again [SEP]
1	[CLS] What more could you ask for ? Our first and only night in Chicago and we fell in love with the city mostly because of our stay at Hotel All ##egro . They were beyond sweet and welcoming to us and our big dogs . Gorge ##ous room , great shower gotta day . Free champagne in the evening and free coffee in the morning , s / o to Jim and Michelle ( front desk manager ) ! They were so awesome and gave us restaurant / bar recommendations . Such an awesome stay . It ’ s downtown and walking distance from everything . Stay here when you visit ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent four nights here on a business trip and was massive ##ly disappointed . R ##ude , un ##hel ##pf ##ul staff , old fashioned and dirty rooms , average breakfast . The hotel clearly hasn ' t been updated since the 80s . To make matters worse , my colleague found a co ##ch ##roach ##e in his room . This is totally revolt ##ing and unacceptable . See photo [SEP]
1	[CLS] We e ##ent this summer and loved this hotel . the location is great an easy walk to restaurants , coffee and the beach ! Chicago in July is hot , so glad they had AC . — only problem was that every night the room was ice cold and the bed was just top sheet and down comfort ##er — no sheet . So I was up all night sweating under the down comfort ##er or freezing without any cover . The second night i went down and asked if we were short sheet ##ed — the very nice desk staff informed me that they don ' t usually give a sheet . ( i sheet you not ) . It must be a European thing . So he kindly offered to have someone drop a sheet to the room . Unfortunately no sheet came . the hotel otherwise was fantastic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So far I have stayed at 3 Kim ##pton Hotels when in the US and the stay at Hotel Monaco in Chicago for 3 nights was top notch as I am getting used to at a Kim ##pton Hotel . The hotel felt like a bout ##ique hotel . Very nice decorations , clean , extremely friendly staff and happy hours from 5 ##pm - 6 ##pm . I would definitely stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I planned this stay because it is very close to the Cadillac the ##ather . The room was fantastic as well as the customer service . The one request that i had was answered so fast that my wife was even impressed ! I would re ##come ##nd the H ##ya ##tt all the time [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am in the hotel right now for a conference of over 250 ##0 engineers . Excellent room with a magnificent view of the river . Public areas are large and comfortable . Restaurant prices are high , but the service is good and the food quality is high . Service and staff are excellent . Re ##com ##men ##ded - - especially if you can get a discount ##ed room rate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room reservation was for a double bed only and we expected it to be small . We were in fact given a queen and the room itself was large and taste ##fully decorated . It was extremely ##qui ##et as well . The Art Institute and Symphony Center are a b ##ock away , as are many of the theaters . We had a ma ##rve ##lous meal at Te ##sor ##is , just down the street . We will choose Palmer House again for our next Chicago get - away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel location is a bit far from most restaurants . There are not many dining options at hotel and the options are expensive . The rooms are typical , the bathroom is small . The Check - In Associate was a bit aggressive , trying to push us to choose a larger room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Alicia checked us in . David helped with our bags Dolores cleaned our rooms and Kate poured us a Guinness So great to be back in a great hotel . Clean , re ##f ##resh ##ed and everybody happy to be working . Here for four nights with three to go . Chicago is a great destination but never better than right now . More to follow . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just stayed here for five nights for business and had a great stay . We especially enjoyed Eddie at the am ##use bar ! He really got to know us over the time we were here which is great especially when you travel a lot ! Will stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in town for a conference and enjoyed my stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l . Front desk staff were very nice and I was able to check in early . My room had great views of Lake Michigan and my room was much larger than I expected for Chicago . I also enjoyed the creative fruit water in the lobby . Only complaint was that the elevator situation was a mess . Con ##stant ##ly had to wait for an elevator only to find it completely full . Then , if you were in a full elevator it still stopped at every floor . Fun . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is excellent , Business tower rooms are the best ones , great service , perhaps could add another one or two restaurants to offer more alternative to a guest with kids . My room as above 20th floor with a great view of the river and lake and the t ##ri ##bu ##ne tower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel . It was our second visit . I would not hesitate to recommend the Talbot ##t . Room was spot ##less , staff is very helpful and will assist with requests . Location is great , just off the the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . So many great restaurants and shops to visit within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As always the Intercontinental Chicago does not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Excellent facility , staff and location . Be sure to take he time and wander though this beautiful once Masonic building for the Shrine . You don ' t find buildings like this anymore in this country . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Joshua is not only very friendly but also very helpful . He explained everything in detail and made sure we got everything we needed ! The hotel is perfect located - breath ##taking view and walk distance to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved everything about this hotel ! It was clean and comfortable and the location was close to everything we wanted to do ! Staff was very friendly and helpful ! Will definitely stay here again in the future ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this hotel so much , I only have good things to say . You can never ever go wrong staying at any Kemp ##ton hotel , but this one especially . The hotel had a perfect location , right smack in the middle of the downtown . Everything was easily accessible by foot . . . ma ##g mile , theatres , navy pier , museums . Nothing was more than a 10 minute walk . The rooms are perfect ! They aren ' t overly large but they are beautiful . We had this amazing window seat / no ##ok that over looked the canal . . . AM ##A ##Z ##ING . You close the curtains behind you and you have your own little reading no ##ok with a view or to enjoy a relaxing glass of wine . Evening wine hour at Kim ##pton hotels are a huge bonus and I am so happy they do it ! Also , each Kim ##pton has great on site dining ! Can ' t wait to go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##up ##le of days we arrived at the Public . First impression was great - very very friendly employees and excellent service . Our room was on the seventh floor . Room ##s seem to be all white which can be awkward in terms of dirt etc . ours was all white and absolutely clean ! Although being located on the 7th floor only we had a great view . 2 things to mention that we were not so happy about : 1 . , pump room was closed on wed ##nes ##day due to season and 2 . , the bath ##tub was just really very small . However this is a very clean and friendly hotel with euro ##pe ##an standards that i can highly recommend . We would stay here again ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I checked in later in the evening and I fell in love with the am ##bian ##ce of the lobby . This hotel has a charm of old school so ##phi ##stic ##ation . My room unfortunately faced the neighboring building and the building was so close I felt as if I could touch the facade , the proximity to the next building wouldn ’ t let any natural light in and it created a wind tunnel that would whisper softly through the night . A huge highlight was being greeted every morning by D ##wayne ’ s ch ##aris ##matic “ hello ” on my way out to work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we stepped out of the car , everything was perfect : great , spacious room with view of the city ’ s sky ##line , good v ##ibes at breakfast and br ##unch in Baptiste & Bo ##ttle and friendly , at ##ten ##tive staff . Thank you Stephen ( Front Office ) and An ##t ##wan ( Baptiste & Bo ##ttle ) for making us feel at home ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Swiss ##ô ##tel is my go to Hotel whenever I ’ m in Chicago for business or pleasure . The rooms and suites are very nice and spacious . Hotel is convenient ##ly located to everything . Service is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble ! I have been booking through front supervisor Mr . Robert Ramos for a couple years now and he always makes sure my stays are very pleasant whether it be from checking in , checking out , and anything in between . It ’ s always nice to feel valued as a customer and treated with ultimate respect . I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciate ##s first class service and ma ##rve ##lous rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ##t beat Michigan Avenue location ! The room is fantastic , love the separating door , the pillows are super flu ##ffy . It has a v ##alet parking which not every hotels in vicinity offer it ! Walking distance to 360 , hop on bus , and all the stores , cafe ##s , restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was in a G ##RE ##AT location , has a super friendly staff , and great amenities . Each room has a functional kitchen ##ette including full size refrigerator , dishes , pots / pan ##s , silver ##ware , etc . We were walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do in the city . I will stay here every time I visit Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The 2 nights me and my s / o stayed there were really nice and very relaxing . I would def recommend it for couples or even just by yourself . And the view was so B ##EA ##UT ##IF ##U ##L , I ’ ll be booking again when I ’ m in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently had family stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel and they loved it ! They were treated like VIP ##S from the minute they pulled up to the front door . The staff was friendly , knowledge ##able and went out of their way to make sure they were happy . They loved their room and they especially loved the breakfast and drinks in the evening . the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel made my family ' s stay extra special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my 3rd visit and for a large convention group , this place is awesome and easily accommodate ##s crowds . Room ##s are quiet and clean . Location is incredible and the location right on River Walk is a huge plus . Food is good . . . price ##y but typical large hotels in a major city . It would be nice if there at least were a few less expensive options . Con ##cier ##ge was amazing and fun . Staff very helpful and friendly . Park ##ing is high priced but other options are within a stone ' s throw . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience . Very clean and comfortable room . The staff was friendly and helpful . Check in was a breeze . Small pool and hot tub but nice and well maintained . The exercise room was updated and nice with patio access . Room service and food was te ##rri ##fic . P ##ric ##y menu but really y ##um ##my . In ##fused water available in lobby , ta ##sty . Newspaper ##s compliment ##ary . Located on the ma ##g mile with all the shopping you could possibly want . Restaurant ##s , W ##al ##green ##s and Star ##bu ##cks a stones throw away . Only improvement would be more pillow variety . Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent stay at the Hilton Chicago for the AC ##H ##E conference in March . I had E ##X ##CE ##P ##TI ##ON ##AL service from Elizabeth He ##in who went above and beyond to help me with my hotel room reservation situation ( between the Palmer House and the Hilton Chicago ) . Steven at the front desk was also pleasant and helpful . 5 stars for the gym , the hotel rooms , the conference meeting rooms and the food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t was very clean , friendly staff , and central ##ly located . The room service was poor , but that was due in large part to the room phone not working and the reception ##ist not forward ##ing our request to a maid who could provide the silver ##ware we were asking for to eat our meal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our 3rd visit to the ta ##l ##bot hotel and once again it didn ’ t di ##sa ##pp ##oint Location is wonderful , especially if your goal is to hit the north Michigan shops and neighborhood stores . The staff is so pleasant , especially the bell ##men , as they welcome you home ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in the Ambassador from the 23rd of November till the 27th . Our room was clean and spacious but nothing spectacular for the price we paid , could do with a k ##ett ##le for tea or coffee in room . . Room service was a bit expensive and the bar was also expensive for drinks . . Beautiful neighbourhood and area around hotel . . Staff at front desk friendly , staff that take your car we found to be very friendly and extremely helpful didn ' t find the staff in the bar to friendly or helpful . . Like ##d that the hotel was dog friendly . . Would I stay here again probably not . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not worth the money . Better hotels in the area where prices are less . Room ##s need up ##dating No fine dining on the property . Going to the Fair ##mont ' s Ma ##ui hotel this month . Hope it ' s worth the price . Poor value in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just loved the Conrad . . not much if anything negative to say . The rooms are modern and f ##abulous with all the high end touches . Double van ##ities and wonderful robes are a nice touch . The rooftop dining / bar was good . . not extensive menu but what we had was great . The hotel is very secure and in a perfect spot right off Michigan ( backs up to C ##rate and Barr ##el ) . Can ##t wait to return ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] From check in to our departure - amazing service and experience ! The view of the city is out of this world and the bathroom was luxurious ! The bed was very comfortable and faced the windows so we could enjoy the city lights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , easy access to the subway and surrounded by theaters and restaurants . The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledge ##able , the room was fantastic and got some really good sleep . Grant ##ed , I use ear plug ##s simply because I live in the b ##oon ##ies and used to quiet , but this hotel was great . Easy walk to the office and a great hotel - highly recommend it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This Hotel is our favorite in Chicago . The staff are friendly and very a ##cco ##mo ##dating . You will love the fact that the hotel is completely re ##mo ##del ##ed . They have a free evening wine reception and morning freshly br ##ew ##ed coffee in the lobby or they will put a Ke ##uri ##g in your room free of charge . It central ##ly located near the theater district . A ##wes ##ome price and service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay for a fun family vacation . I ##dea ##lly located for seeing the sights . We found the staff helpful and professional . We enjoyed the pool , hot tub ##s . The con ##cier ##ges were great and made our adventures fun [SEP]
1	[CLS] Get hotel with very nice amenities and located in a very nice location . Staff is very helpful and within walking distance to many attractions and restaurants Will stay again when I am in the area on bus ##sin ##ess . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights for NY ##E . Hotel was booked which was their excuse for not having the room ready upon check - in which was 30 minutes after the designated check in time . Room te ##mp could not regulate in suite between the bedroom and the living space . Cold draft coming in from windows directly on the bed . Very cold bedroom , very hot living space trying to regulate . Great location . If going to spend anytime in the room or hotel , look elsewhere . Many com ##par ##ible options nearby to give you better service and comfort for $ $ $ . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a weekend here , and have nothing to complain about . This is a very good place to stay . Room ##s beautifully decorated , location within an easy walk or cab ride , and enjoyed free wine during wine hour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 2 nights . Staff was great , location even better . You were within walking distance of everything . Bed was comfortable and room was clean .

1	[CLS] This hotel is located in the heart of where you want to be . Easy to walk everywhere and some good views . Super helpful staff and the wine happy hour is welcome . Room ##s are decorated in Art Dec ##o style . Lost one star for the bathroom ##s which while large enough was out ##dated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would definitely stay here again . Great location , friendly staff , amazing ##ly comfortable beds ! Some have commented that the rooms are small , but my husband and I actually felt that the room size was larger than others in the Chicago area . We were not uncomfortable by any means . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ing at the Talbot is like coming home ! Everyone greet ##s you and welcome ##s you from the time you arrive until you leave . D ##wayne even came up to help us with our luggage without us even asking him ! And on top of the wonderful staff , it ’ s a truly amazing location ! Don ’ t miss it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 2 nights while exploring Chicago . We were able to walk most places that we wanted . It had a great view of the river and of Lake Michigan with Navy Pier . The pool was warm and the gym is adequate . We had parking included with our package and had no problem getting our ticket valid ##ated . The bed and amenities were comfortable . Our room was located right off the elevators , but noise was never an issue . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a pleasant experience while visiting the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Hotel during one of the cold ##est winters in Chicago that I can remember . I was in town for three days for a French Past ##ry Class . The te ##mps were - 40 with the wind chill . The staff warmly welcomed me and were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , the rooms very comfortable . When I returned one night from my class I was surprised by a kind note , bubble bath and wine glass I requested . I enjoyed my stay immensely and will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location - - - short walking distance to the Pier , shopping , restaurants . And right across the street from the Sugar Factory ! ! ! ! The room was very clean . The staff was professional and friendly . Our teenage girls slept on the hide - a - way and loved it . The breakfast - - very good . We had no idea they had a social hour with more amazing food . It helped a lot keeping our budget on track ! We will stay here again and again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] there was renovation going on on the lower floors , but in my room in the 16th story it was not noticeable . the room was small but at a very high standard and clean , just nice for one night . the free bike rental was very much appreciated , however the bike was quite small and the gear was locked at highest level , could be better . price / value expectation overall was exceeded . check ##in and check ##out window is good ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] When I travel to Chicago the Ki ##nz ##ie is always a great option to stay cent ##ric in a clean hotel with excellent customer service . The staff service was very re ##sp ##ons ##ive and efficient from the welcome to any request or questions I had . See you next ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was run down , old , falling apart , must ##y smell in rooms . Pool was closed . Hotel staff rude . . they took and extra $ 275 off my cash card , $ 125 of it was not approved and they would not give it back until I checked out . We had no money left for our trip . Manager was rude and con ##des ##cend ##ing when I told her about what happened . . she just kept telling me it ’ s policy to continue to take money out of the card . They never informed me of this . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had the pleasure of staying at the Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco Chicago for a night while in the city with my nephew , and we enjoyed a beautiful one - bedroom suite . The room was clean , very well maintained , and had plenty of space - - the com ##fy seating along the windows was even a nice touch . Hotel staff was super friendly and casual ( in a good way ) . Location in the Loop was excellent - - close by just about everything , including the train lines . I ' ll definitely be back to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was closed for a year due to CO ##VI ##D . Should have updated the rooms as they are out ##dated and run down . The lobby is still iconic and amazing , but the rooms and hallway ##s have not been updated in at least 30 years . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a lot of money per night for just average service and rooms . Don ' t get booked a room near the elevator . You ' ll never sleep . Had to chase down extra towels . Guess I ' m not supposed to shower more than once in a day . West tower had none of their bars or restaurants open , leaving you no choice but to go over to the heavily crowded East tower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was several times in this hotel and always appreciate the spacious room , the clean room and clean hotel in general . The warm welcome and staff always willing to help is a plus . Well arranged and well managed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and view . Our Room appeared to be clean but was not happy when I found sand on the bath tub and shower . I assume there was a pool because I assume there was a pool because of photos I saw but the fitness ’ s area was closed and I was told there was no pool [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for business conference and was very pleased all around . The hotel ’ s “ right on the river ” location makes for easy exploration of downtown Chicago . Room ##s were clean and up to date as was the rest of the hotel . Shu ##la ’ s steak ##house is also a plus to have on site . Co ##m ##fort ##able and easy stay all around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here 3 nights while attending a professional board meeting . Location was great , able to walk everywhere except to and from the airport . The Ki ##nz ##ie coins are a great idea ! And the continental breakfast on each floor was very appreciated . The bed was super comfortable and the room very quiet . Extreme ##ly polite and helpful staff from check in to check out . Looking forward to future stays . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco was a G ##RE ##AT little hotel with amazing window seats , a great central location , and a fun v ##ibe . But . . . even with the the ##rm ##ost ##at at 61 degrees , the room was H ##OT all the time . A few of the power outlets didn ' t work . . . all in all a great stay , but these little things shouldn ' t happen . I expect everything to function well at a Kim ##pton . The room itself was very pretty , bathroom was super nice . . . and as always - the bed was very com ##fy . The location is P ##ER ##F ##EC ##T ! Close to everything and an easy walk to almost everything ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel exceeded all expectations . Right from Check - in , Nik ##ko helped with everything im ##agi ##na ##ble and even worked to save me money on parking . The room was clean and relevant , and the entire hotel was warm and inviting . At breakfast , Dar ##ti ##que and De ##yon ##te served as reminder ##s of what truly outstanding customer service is . Whatever these two guys are getting paid , it ' s not enough - I will be staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie in the future for the breakfast service provided by these two . Overall , 5 star stay . Thanks ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Average hotel for four stars . Stay ##ed at another hotel the night before and had better room for the money paid . Overall nice views for money but not worth the $ 230 a night stay . You could get more for your money in the same location for less . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Until my recent stay , I had not visited the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile is several years . I was so pleased to find the same imp ##ec ##ca ##ble rooms and service that I remembered . The rooms have been maintained nicely and the front desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The age of this building definitely shows , but you cannot beat the stunning lobby . Worth a visit even you aren ' t staying here . I generally stay here when in Chicago , and they do a very solid job . The rooms are nice but definitely feel old , and not in a charming way . This is a massive hotel , so if you ' re looking for something q ##ua ##int , this isn ' t it . On the upside , you hardly have to leave the hotel to find anything you need . It ' s an central as it gets to Chicago , so definitely a great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here recently and were very pleased at the modern renovation of this bout ##ique hotel . Excellent River North location close to great restaurants , shopping and the House of Blues . They offer free continental breakfast on each floor . The staff were te ##rri ##fic ! I ' d definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay at the Talbot ##t was over a period of 3 nights and it was great . They had a great price and the rooms were also pretty amazing . I had a really bad view , but it was one of the back rooms . They have a great little gym for this size hotel . Du ##mbe ##lls , t ##read ##mill ##s , and a p ##elo ##ton spin bike . The staff was also really great , especially the door ##man , D ##wayne . Always greeted us with a smile and a well wish on our way out and a welcome on our way back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am staying right now at this hotel due to the I ##MT ##S Show . Really very disappointed for many reasons : no room make up , no compliment ##ary water bottle in the room ; mini ##bar completely empty , very few dining options ; that ’ s not the standard I am used to and not the Hilton ’ s one . The rate I am paying is nearly 500 $ per night ; could you believe that ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , design , and lobby . The property is tired and needs a minor renovation . The fitness center is in poor shape with limited equipment and not good for a business travel ##er ( no C ##NBC , CNN , etc . ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall the stay here was nice . We stayed for 3 nights . The con ##cier ##ge , bell men and reception were all very court ##eous and helpful . You can walk to a lot of restaurants and do some sight seeing . The rooms did not appeal to my aesthetic taste , the light colored wood ( oak ? ) was everywhere and overwhelming . The shower was also very small , but it did have a tub to so ##ak in as well . They have a little bar downstairs and we got terrible service both times we went , which was sad because we were so impressed with the outstanding service that we received everywhere else in Chicago but that place really missed the mark . I think i ' d stay somewhere else next time , but I overall the stay was fine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We highly recommend the Talbot ##t Hotel , excellent service provided by D ##wayne N ##ef ##f . D ##wayne went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect . We were accompanied by two friends that had not had the pleasure of staying at the Talbot ##t previously . D ##wayne made a lasting impression they are looking forward to our next trip to Chicago and staying with the Talbot ##t ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location and we had a good value for where it is but the place feels cold , from the lobby to the halls to the room . N ##eu ##tral colors , no decoration , a very minimal and industrial feel to the entire property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service at check in and check out was terrible . We asked for our wedding party gift bag for 3 days and was told it was not there . Calling the desk was always put on hold and never answered . We saw the bag behind the counter ourselves and when we asked for it they g ##rille ##d us , offered no apology and could have cared less . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton is a beautiful hotel and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! It was very convenient to our destinations around Chicago . The view of Lake Michigan was wonderful ! The parking was a bit expensive : $ 75 per night but that was the only down ##side . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An outstanding hotel with an excellent staff who are committed to customer care and comfort . We enjoyed the wine and c ##ider hour from 5 - 6 P . M . Unfortunately are room was not ready as we checked in early . The staff kept our bags secure ##ly as we asked for advice on nearby restaurant / coffee shops to visit . We are ready to go hit the neighborhood as the staff says " Sir , your room is ready . " We felt very comfortable with the way we were treated . The room was large , clean , bright and the best feature was the large window area with 8 foot wide pillow ##ed area to relax in and enjoy the Chicago River views ! Inc ##red ##ible ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are from Denver , and started following Hotel Monaco through “ Pack Up Go ” . We booked a trip through them and couldn ’ t wait to have a chance to come to this hotel . It ’ s a darling , bout ##ique hotel . The de ##cor is gorgeous and the staff is very friendly — they have a compliment ##ary wine hour every night in the lobby from 5 - 6 ##pm ! ! Their restaurant Fi ##sk & Co is delicious and we didn ’ t have anything we didn ’ t love . Our favorite waiter was Jon : ) . Our room was to die for and extremely comfortable . My most important thing in a hotel room is clean ##liness : this room surpassed by expectations . ( And I even took sheets off and inspected the mattress and behind the bed . . . im ##ma ##culate ! ! ) . Thanks again for an amazing 5 day retreat . We will be [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose this primarily for its location and suite package . Found out you can actually fill up on breakfast run around town and return at 5 : 30 ##pm for dinner with wine or beer . Al ##bei ##t a lighter fare for dinner but certainly enough if you ' re looking for economy , nice variety th ##ru the week . The suite was quite comfortable : sofa ( converts to bed ) chairs & t ##v , a very convenient kitchen ##ette ( includes table ##ware , etc ) w / dish ##wash ##er and fridge . Private bedroom w / t ##v , adequate bath & storage . De ##fin ##ite ##ly suitable for family or 2 couples . We were quite happy to have it as a re ##sp ##ite to return to after walking the town before heading out again for the evening . Will return ! Pleasant staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location of this hidden G ##em . The staff was outstanding , the evening reception was exceptional and the lobby ( with its little extra ##s ) was so inviting and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . We loved it . It is so clean , so perfect . Would def stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very noisy , can hear everything from the adjoining rooms . Staff started at 6 : 30 a . m . talking loudly in the stairwell next to our room . Bo ##ttle ##d water on the desk not marked as available for purchase , just sitting there . Re ##ceived an after check ##out charge for $ 6 . 65 for the water when the front desk had removed the charge due to it not having the available for purchase tag on it . Many other choices in Chicago that are better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lori Simmons in the lost and found department was amazing ! She was kind and very helpful . She even found items that I didn ' t know were left in the room . The items left in the hotel room were returned to me promptly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Too ##k kids to first ever Cubs game . We return back from the game hoping to let the kids swim . The pool was under renovation and we received no alert at check in . Back up fitness club closed @ 6 ##pm . C ##rap [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had arranged to stay at this hotel months ahead and had booked three rooms for several family members . Some guests in two other rooms on our same corridor part ##ied for two days ( and nights ) straight , so loud they could be heard at the end of the hall and in our room with a door closed ; their kids ran all over the halls un ##su ##per ##vise ##d . Our complaints received only a couple of security guard visits and no follow ##up ; we will think twice before staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel frequently for business and the N ##UM ##BE ##R ONE item that matters most to me is the work ##out facilities . The H ##ya ##tt Regency in downtown Chicago has one of the B ##ES ##T fitness centres i ' ve seen in a hotel . TO ##NS of card ##io equipment AND high caliber strength equipment . And it ' s open 24 ##h / day . I was so happy when I discovered this as it was not that clear on their website . Their rooms are clean and modern , albeit on a smaller side but I did not need anything more . The Location is un ##beat ##able . ! ! Anything you want is within a block or two from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is perfect for sights ##ee ##ing in the Loop and downtown areas . Our room was in excellent condition and had a gorgeous view of the park and the lake . The staff was friendly and helpful - I would definitely stay there again . My only comment to them was that it would be nice to see some meal selections at a lower price point . We ate all of our meals at restaurants . Fortunately , there are many lovely restaurants within walking distance of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel enjoys a great location and it is nearby the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and the Millennium Park . The reception staff is great and super helpful ! They made me feel welcome and assisted me with my hotel needs . I would definitely recommend this q ##ua ##int and class ##y hotel . I just hope they get me into higher floor next time around ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay at this hotel was quite wonderful . Room , staff , service were exceptional . The cleaning staff , and the door ##men were absolutely the best . John - the bartender in the hotel restaurant - Columbus Ta ##p - was the most persona ##ble bartender ever experienced in Chicago . Only moderate concern - shelf space in bathroom was very minimal and floor in bath hadn ' t been m ##opped in a few days . Great hotel , great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at Talbot ##t for our wedding . We initially had a wedding block set up , but CO ##VI ##D changed everything . However , Talbot ##t was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and understanding from beginning to end . The level of communication and response time was great and helped lower the stress level while planning our wedding . My wife used the M ##c ##R ##ae Room to get ready with her bride ##sma ##ids and everything was perfect for them . High ##ly recommend the Talbot ##t for your wedding block or stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location at the north end of the magnificent mile , but still only a block from the Water Tower ##M ##all . I loved the de ##cor and style of this hotel . The rooms were quite spacious , clean modern and a large bathroom shower . Unfortunately only one of the three elevators was working on the day we stayed there , but I ' ve waited longer in hotels with fully functional elevators . I ' d definitely consider again for my next visit to downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a conference and it was a great stay from the ease of check in to the spacious room . I had a view of the river and it looked great ! The only issues I had was my room was right by the elevator so I can here it go up and down and the check out like was super long . I think scheduling could have been anticipated when you are aware of a large check out process due to groups . Other than that , I love the located of the property as it is central ##ly located and walking distance to most of the attraction of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visit the lobby every Christmas and was excited to stay for the first time . I get that this hotel is O ##LD but the room is not Hip and Historic . The room was clean but the easy chair was long beyond its useful ##ness . A piece of crown mold ##ing was missing . The van ##ity in the bath was junk ##y and the toilet ##ries were near empty . Gross . There was no coffee maker , fridge or breakfast room service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m normally a heavy sleep ##er . However , the mattress was so sq ##ui ##sh ##y that it offered no support , even after I asked twice for a bed board and finally got it . I was in street facing room , which added to the sleep ##less nights since you could hear E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING at all hours of the night . I returned home absolutely exhausted After four long nights there . Great location , but it doesn ' t matter if you can ' t get a good night ' s rest ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are looking for details this hotel has it all . Room ##s are the best I ’ ve seen , with perfect Chicago river and Lake Michigan view . I stayed on the 40th floor and it was spectacular . The beds and linen ##s are worth every dollar you spent . Em ##p ##loy ##ees were very court ##eous and at ##ten ##tive . Vale ##t parking is $ 70 and you can go in and out as many times as you need . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon arrival at the hotel via taxi , Antonio warmly greeted us with a smile and a hug . He promptly retrieved our luggage and escorted us inside . He told the registration staff the name of the reservation and which room we always liked . He is good ! We were assigned our requested room . I had asked for an extra luggage stand and coffee maker for our room . Both were in the room when we arrived . I try to get to Chicago 2 - 3 times a year and always stay at Hotel Monaco . The location is perfect for the theater . Four theaters within easy walking distance . Same with restaurants . If you are a Ka ##rma Re ##ward ##s member , Internet is compliment ##ary and you get a $ 10 " raid the mini - bar " credit . Pi ##llow ##s are great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] One thing I ' ve learned about Kim ##pton , they Do Not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . P ##lent ##y of open space lobby seating is somewhat expected from these guys & this location is no different . If you are looking for a private space , they have it , a place to con ##g ##re ##gate & chat , got that , a bar to meet new folks , got that too . Room ##s are compact , well appointed as one would expect in the city . Great gym & meeting rooms make for an All - in - one property . Cha ##rming staff saw to all requests without hesitation . I ' ll be back here in a few months . Great location in the Theater District make this site a nice home base for your Chicago Experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights in this central ##ly located hotel . Given the friendly rate I was pleasant ##ly surprised by the very comfortable , spacious and luxurious room . Very kind staff , breakfast included and a fine gym . Fun detail : communications from room to front desk goes via text ##ing . This hotel offers value for money . Re ##com ##men ##ded ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thank you to Shannon for making our hotel experience in ch ##ica ##go a five star experience ! Hotel was great but going to the bar with three kids and their several needs and having Shannon go above and beyond was a very satisfying customer service experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was very pleased with my stay and would consider returning . The value for the room was quite good and I would like to have the opportunity to return . The location was good , with a number of very good restaurants within a short walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were treated like royalty . The staff was friendly and at ##ten ##tive . I noticed a mistake on the bill when I got home . When I called Robert remembered me and quickly fixed the problem . The rooms are beautiful and very clean with lots of thoughtful touches . [SEP]
1	[CLS] East tower de ##cor a bit tired . F ##oy ##er excellent and the Bar awesome . Dr ##ink ##s selection limited especially the wine list could have been more extensive . Good location close to the river walk . Would stay again in the future when back in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel ! We booked the American Girl package which included parking and breakfast plus so many extra ##s for our granddaughter . Staff at the hotel were exceptional ! Love the doll bed , p ##j ##s , robe and book that came with the package . Each night the turn ##down service left cookies and milk . Wonderful stay ! We will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , but room extremely s ##hab ##by and dated . The bar area was not con ##du ##ci ##ve to comfort . Hotel reception not very helpful on check - in , however the con ##cier ##ge was very know ##led ##gable and helpful . I wouldn ' t recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great room and we ' ll looked after by staff , first visit to Chicago and could not have picked a better hotel , staff so pleasant and can ' t do enough to make your stay so great . The lobby has a bar and great music for you to relax , the de ##cor is great and makes you feel so relaxed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My sister - in - law and I chose this hotel to meet for a " girls weekend away " and it couldn ' t have been better ! From the minute the you walk in the door you are made to feel special . The de ##cor is taste ##ful and the ladies at the front desk were delight ##ful and anxious to please . The compliment ##ary wine in the afternoon was welcome . Every employee we talked to was friendly and made us feel special . The location can ' t be beat - right near the Chicago River and a couple blocks from shopping on State Street and the Chicago Theater . This is now my go - to place for visiting Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I left a dark din ##gy hotel and checked into the magical P ##U ##BL ##IC our last night in Chicago . I only wish that we had stayed here for our entire visit . What a lovely spot ! Having stayed previously in several other Sc ##hra ##ger Hotels , I understood his vision ; i . e . to make staying in the beautiful Gold Coast affordable . But not only is the hotel affordable , it is quite beautiful . For anyone affected by his or her surroundings , this hotel is an architectural wonder full or history and g ##lamour and the d ##é ##cor is s ##ty ##lish , simple , and very taste ##ful . We will definitely return to this hotel , despite the fact that it was recently sold and will soon become the Ambassador Hotel once again . One can only hope that the new owners retain the beauty that was Sc ##hra ##ger ' s vision . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was impressive , so was the view . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed , linen ##s smelled good , no complaints . Staff was friendly , breakfast room service was good , really like the brown bag delivery . Will definitely stay here again , thanks ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at the ambassador Chicago it is a historical hotel located in the best ever part of Chicago which is the Gold Coast the staff is f ##abulous . . . . Thank you Maria . Mal ##don ##ado Super ##visor . I made reservation for my next visit thank you [UNK] na ##mas ##te [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel location is great for downtown Chicago , but you will have an " urban facility fee " of $ 15 a night added to your bill , not shown in the Hotels . com price . A S ##nick ##ers Bar f ##ro the snack draw was $ 5 . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a historical g ##em that Conrad Hilton would be proud of . From v ##alet to front desk , to all staff the service culture here is embedded and at the level one expects from a luxury brand in the big city . Room ##s are clean and comfortable - well located - dog friendly . The standard rooms are on the small side as would be expected from a convention property but perfect for a single or couple . Our only issue was the room was hot and we could not really lower the te ##mp as we prefer . All in all this is a go to property and highly recommended [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is in a great location for just about anything in Chicago . Once you park ( v ##alet is e ##asi ##est ) you ' re close enough to walk to everything . Lo ##bby restaurant has great breakfast ##s , fast and competitive ##ly priced for Chicago . On - line check in and out worked well and e ##ffe ##cie ##ntly [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a g ##em ! Staff was kind , knowledge ##able & exceeded our expectations in many ways ! Room was a bit small but all downtown hotels tend to be small . Located close to W ##rig ##ley ##ville , Lincoln Park , and in the Gold Coast ! Shopping & din ##ng very close & nice walk ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a wonderful bout ##ique style re ##sp ##ite from the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le of the city . We checked in and the staff from the door ##man to the front desk were all very friendly and helpful . Our room had a wonderful view and was very clean and comfortable . Bed ##s were superb with plenty of pillows . Love the free hot chocolate and wine hour in the evening . Note that this hotel is also dog friendly , saw everything from a Saint Bernard to a cute little C ##ava ##lier . Walking distance for plenty to do , from the Theatre district to shopping . Park ##ing is a little expensive at $ 58 a day but you have free in and outs whenever you need . Would stay here again in a heart beat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very big old fashioned style hotel . Fantastic place in Chicago , close yo Mill ##eni ##um park . Probably best place . Large rooms with awesome views and big bathroom ##s . Very nice and quick service . Breakfast ##s are expensive and food offer is average . Spa is very expensive . No pool , just fitness , sa ##una and massage ##s . Suit ##able for business trips . For families is quite expensive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a delight to be so p ##amp ##ered in the city . The beds were very comfortable , the rooms clean and had exactly what I needed , and the Happy Hour food was delicious and the service there fantastic . All in all a delight ##ful visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for the Theater and Concert ##s and Downtown Loop shopping . Close to the Art Institute . Some ##w ##hat small rooms . Beautiful vintage hotel ! The standard rooms are small and need a little up ##dating . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we drove up to the hotel , we were greeted promptly by the Bell staff to retrieve our bags and car . I ' m not sure we even hesitated at the Bell desk before getting our ticket and getting on the elevator . We were greeted in the lobby by the Des ##k Clerk by name who welcomed us and led us to the front desk . Check in was 2 - 3 minutes . Free water and soft drinks is a great touch . Room Service , Extra Pi ##llow ##s , Maid Service were all handled with smiles and enthusiasm . Best staff we have ever experienced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was gorgeous ! There was a convention and a wedding the weekend I was there so check in was slow . When I was assisted , Jackie ( j ##ay ##c ##lin ? ) At the front desk was amazing ! She quickly got me checked in and thanked me for being so patient while other guests were not by up ##grading my room to a river view ! Thank you Jackie , you really made my day ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Once we arrived checking in was efficient and easy . We stayed in the Superior Double Room . The room was spacious and very clean . My favorite feature in the room was the ceiling shower head . The hotel followed Co ##vid - 19 protocols with guest wearing mask , providing hand sa ##ni ##ti ##zer , ad ##hering to physical di ##stan ##cing , and allowing limited guest to use the elevator at once . Jason , the manager , professional ##ism and at ##ten ##tive ##ness was superb ! He wanted us to have the best experience at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker ! This was an amazing location to relax and explore the great city of Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Work put me up in the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for 2 nights and I would say " what a treat ! " The bed was extremely com ##fy , the room was very clean , and I absolutely L ##O ##VE ##D the shower and bath products to go with . The staff were much too sweet and every single person made me feel like VIP when I came back for the night and left for the morning . Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone for business or pleasure and I would love to stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] When travelling for business you want to have no has ##st ##le , comfort room , easy access and good food . With this hotel you have all of that for a descent price . I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel and staff is always excellent . Big , clean comfortable rooms with excellent views . I stay here every - time I come to Chicago and I am never disappointed . It is located in a great location and is always comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location , our room was small and not really well designed but comfortable . I would like to have been able to turn the heat down more but guess it ' s hard to manage in a hotel which is quite old . The staff were fine , breakfast ok , most excellent toast ##er ! We enjoyed our stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We recently hosted a group of professionals at this beautiful hotel . From the very start of the process through the event itself , every single detail was top - notch ! Taylor Far ##ella did an amazing job representing Conrad Chicago and made sure our event was smooth as silk . Our guests loved the rooms ! The food was wonderful and the service was excellent . We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and we will definitely keep it on our list of places to visit again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If your an Ambassador member , don ' t stay here . I was told its management ##s discretion to give you your " G ##ua ##rant ##eed " upgraded room . Then as you go in your room that nice , but not upgraded , you will see a br ##och ##ure , trying to get you to become an Ambassador , with one of the per ##ks a guaranteed room upgrade . The hotel is nice and is in a good location . But go somewhere they keep their word . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Beautiful hotel in a great location . G ##reet ##ed professionally when we came in and out of the hotel . I left behind my necklace and I was called immediately and it was shipped back to me . I appreciate the honesty and integrity of the staff here . I will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here on a birthday trip to Chicago for my husband . The lobby and banquet rooms are beautiful . The actual room was small and needs some updates . The parking garage is close which makes it convenient . We would stay here again , but probably not as a family . . . . just as a couple . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We live in the Chicago suburbs and decided to stay downtown for a birthday celebration including an evening at the House of Blues . The Ki ##nz ##ie is 1 / 2 block away - right across from The Trump Tower . It is a perfect location - easy access to The River Walk , The Chicago Theater , Millennium Park and The Ma ##g Mile . The hotel is a small bout ##ique hotel . The staff couldn ' t have been nice ##r . Our room was spacious and very clean with huge windows and a great view . The included drinks and app ##eti ##zers were above average . The also included breakfast is served on every floor making it very convenient . And it is served until 10 : 30 - how very civil ##ized ! We have decided that the location and amenities make this the perfect place to stay and hope to be back regularly . What a wonderful find ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 4 nights and I was very disappointed to find out they only have free w ##if ##i in the lobby , if you want it on your room they charge 20 USD per day , I ' ve traveled all over and stayed in every kind of hotels and in my experience this is something that happened 15 years ago , now it just sea ##ms cheap . Room ##s are nice , location is fine but nothing in this hotel is too nice [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was well located . Staff was friendly . Room ##s were clean and well stock ##ed . I thought breakfast was over ##p ##rice ##d , and you have to pay an extra fee to use the gym . . . but the gym was very well equipped . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we arrived late Friday with a " luggage mi ##sha ##p " that made a mess of one of our bags , the Talbot ##t team sprang into action and cleaned everything by the next morning ! Our room was im ##ma ##culate ##ly cleaned every day . We spent time in the really nice bar , a couple of times . The location can ' t be beat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great night ' s stay at the Conrad in Chicago . The rooms are well appointed and very quiet . The hotel is elegant . It is a very good location as well . The new su ##shi bar is nice on the rooftop also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From then time we checked in - until we left - this was an amazing experience . I will never stay any place else . Our room was beautiful , clean and very comfortable . The bar is beautiful - as is the new restaurant . A totally beyond wonderful time - the staff made this the best stay truly - a great hotel and unique stay can ##t wait to go back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful service , adorable hotel , and compliment ##ary gold ##fish . Not much more we could have asked for . The room was more than quiet , our view was beautiful and overlooked the Chicago River . There was plenty of space seeing as there were four of us staying in one room . The service was nice and very pro ##mpt ; the styling eclectic , but simple enough to suit our needs without going over the top . Very much re ##cco ##men ##d and will stay here the next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I hadn ' t heard much about the Conrad since it moved but I was very happy with my recent 2 night stay . The desk and door staff were super friendly and extremely at ##ten ##tive and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The room was very large , spot ##less and well appointed . Great views and fantastic location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Pretty good hotel , friendly staff would recommend it . For the price one of the better ones around . In the middle of Chicago and able to walk around very easily . Staff very friendly and would recommend to friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was wonderful . Only thing is that I didn ' t know that the gym was under renovation . It would be nice if they could partner with a nearby hotel to allow Swiss ##ote ##l patrons to use their facilities while under construction . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Before booking on here check their website . Their mobile only last minute deal was a better price . You won ' t need a car this hotel is in walking distance to everything . We took the train from / to the airport and an U ##ber to a Bulls game . We loved the robes and free ( cold ) breakfast on every floor . We enjoyed the evening social for a free drink and snack before going back out in to the city . The con ##cier ##ge was very helpful and knowledge ##able . For being military we were upgraded to a city view room at no charge . We have paid a lot more for a lot less so were very impressed with the value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Extreme ##ly friendly staff who are helpful and polite . The location makes it easy to get to places in downtown Chicago . The rooms are very nice ! The ##r bar has a nice menu and a big variety of choices . It is nice to have a market in the lobby of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for work . Bed ##s & pillows were some of the most comfortable I ' ve ever had at a hotel . The location of this hotel is great ! Walking distance to great restaurants , bars , the bean , and even Navy Pier if you like walking like I do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice rooms , f ##abulous location , good value given where it is located , close to many of the great sites and eat ##eries Chicago has to offer . El ##eva ##tors can be if ##fy and be prepared to wait if you eat in the hotel restaurant - some of the servers ' get up and go has got up and gone . Overall it is well worth a visit when in the Wind ##y City . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is not up to a regular Hilton ’ s standards . Room ##s are very run down , m ##ou ##ld ##y and barely clean - we stayed a week in which our room was cleaned 3 times , sheets never changed and carpet never ho ##over ##ed . I even called the front desk for it to be cleaned and it still wasn ’ t . The staff are rude , un ##hel ##pf ##ul and generally stand ##off ##ish like it ’ s too much to help you . My biggest complaint is when they tried to kick us out of our room 2 days early as they had messed up the booking ! We then had to go down to the front desk after being rude ##ly awoke ##n by house ##keeping to sort this issue out ! After we showed proof we then had to re ##che ##ck in ? ! Poor quality and customer service from what is a Hilton - more like a motel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very comfortable hotel . Very convenient position for visiting the sights of Chicago . The room we had was in excellent condition and well equipped . The building itself is a fine piece of architecture . The restaurant was quite good but not as good as they thought it was . The evening meal we had was meant to be fine dining but didn ' t quite make the standard . Our inclusive breakfast menu was a little limiting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] went up for the Cubs convention back in January and had a blast . I love this hotel . the hotel staff was great and helpful . will go back again for sure . Food was close to walk to or have delivered . rooms was clean and co ##zy [SEP]
1	[CLS] They ’ ve renovated the rooms but they are S ##O average inside . Kind of a disappointment compared to the beautiful lobby . Dec ##ent location , long walk to main shopping area but there is a bus to get there easily . Crazy expensive parking if you bring a car ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was in a great location close to a number of places to eat and attractions like the river walk and boat tours , millennium park , magnificent mile and navy pier . The hotel was clean and had great amenities the staff were fantastic , the room I was in on the 27th floor had a great view of the river and lake . The food was very good and there was a good selection of drinks in the bar . I will be happy to stay here again when next visiting Chicago and would definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , staff is excellent all suite hotel is a real plus : ) ) Ask ##ed for a high floor and a corner room for our three night stay . We have stayed at this location before so we new a lot about this Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is central ##ly located in Chicago . It has been re ##mo ##lded . Room ##s are well done but small and well organized . Very clean and quite The food was delicious . A great St ##eak sandwich hit the spot have a long day of travel . Great coffee in the morning [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed here several times . Excellent location and lovely staff . All that you would expect from a So ##fit ##el . Nice gym and bar with eclectic crowd . Close to shopping and tourist sites . Great architecture of hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is a g ##em with great visual ##s well placed in the midst of the city . Room ##s are definitely small but with those fine l ##ux touches were possible . The staff was friendly and willing to assist and the restaurant downstairs also offered good cocktail ##s and food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this hotel for a wedding accommodation ##s . The location is nice , the bars are lovely and price ##y . We had some difficulties getting into rooms in a time ##ly fashion , v ##alet service was slow , and rooms were cleaned late in the day . It is an expensive hotel and I was hoping for a little better experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ##mp ##ec ##ca ##ble service . Staff could not have been more friendly or a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . A ##wes ##ome room . Great de ##cor and view . Hotel is also in a great location . Most activities were within walking distance . Staff treated us like royalty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We reserved King room with " city view . " Our room barely met the description . We stayed Fr ##i - Sun nights but there was not enough drawer space for two to completely un ##pack . The room was small . That being said , the room was well outfit ##ted electronic ##ally ; very clean ; plenty of bath linen ##s ; staff was perfect and actually refused tips ( " It ' s part of our service " when tip offered upon departure help with bags ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel ( previously the Am ##al ##fi ) since the fall of 2013 , when I began traveling regularly to Chicago for business . The compliment ##ary breakfast is a great guest benefit , as is the evening reception in the Double Cross . Room ##s are comfortably furnished . I want to particularly recognize the door ##man Ra ##fi , who has been a regular face for each of my trips . He has been friendly , persona ##ble , and un ##fa ##iling ##ly helpful to me . I will continue to visit the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel during upcoming trips to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was on an upper floor facing Michigan Ave . This hotel is across from a hospital so sire ##ns kept us awake for much of the night . Walls were thin so the kids screaming next door were clearly heard . It ' s too bad as the room was nice and the breakfast was excellent . Would not stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently spent a get - away weekend at the Hilton . We had not visited the hotel in several years and were pleasant ##ly surprised to see nothing had really changed . We stayed in a double bed , double bath room on the 20th floor . The room rate was un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly good ( nominally $ 125 per night ) . Service was excellent , and the food , including light breakfast room service , was great . This is a great location for couples , as the place is not over run with children on the weekends . The Hilton is still our favorite downtown Chicago hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great location ! So much very close by ! We met family here and it was a plea ##su ##rable experience ! The staff was very at ##ten ##tive ! I would highly recommend this property for ease of location and things to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time visit to Chicago over Memorial Day Weekend and had a wonderful stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago . We had nothing to complain about , the room ( corner king with river / lake view ) was great and it was clean . Everyone was so friendly - reception staff , house ##keeping staff , in fact everyone we walked by always had a hello / helpful attitude . We had an afternoon drink outside at the Burger restaurant on the River ##walk level and they were just as nice . B ##UT I have to give a special shout out to the con ##cier ##ge , Suzanne , who truly made our stay a memorable one . Her advice was spot on and always had a smile no matter how many questions I asked ! Location of this hotel is great – we either walked or short U ##ber to wherever we wanted to go . I highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel building itself is a very cool mix of old and modern , but the service all around was poor . All staff members I encountered seemed brand new - not knowledge ##able , not a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , in ##ef ##ficient , and in ##ex ##per ##ienced - but on top of that the attitude and customer service were poor . Will not be returning to P ##U ##BL ##IC for this business trip next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have been staying at the Ambassador for over 10 years . The staff from the front desk to house ##keeping couldn ' t be more a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They make us feel like it is our second home . In addition to the great accommodation ##s we have use the catering department for various occasions . Always done to perfection . We value their service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s improved after renovation . O ##ust ##and ##ing parking service with AM ##ER and his team , always within 10 minutes . Extreme ##ly friendly and always very helpful regarding up to date news / events in Chicago . Most recommended [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic service and menu at No ##yan ##e , great location near Michigan Avenue super convenient , chef Sand ##ova ##l offer great food options and the rooms as well as the attention ##s are superb , a most stay hotel in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ing out today from the Home ##wood Suite ##s Downtown . We stayed for 3 nights in a 1 bedroom king suite with 4 people . The room was nice and worked well having a kitchen with fridge , stove , dish ##wash ##er , etc . . . The pull out bed was not that comfortable but we made the best of it . They offer a nice hot breakfast every morning which is included so a great added value . During the week a cocktail hour with wine / beer and light food is available to all guests . The door men were super friendly , the location is great and overall had a very nice stay for the price we paid . A few negative comments I will mention is a very slow internet and long waits for the only 2 elevators in this property . We would not hesitate to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is location is ID ##EA ##L . You are at the end of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for shopping , one block to the River ##walk . . . which was very nice for a morning walk , a few blocks to Navy Pier and not far to Millennium Park . The breakfast b ##uff ##et was R ##EA ##LL ##Y good and had different items each day we were there ( the wa ##ffles are amazing ) . Star ##bu ##cks R ##IG ##HT in the lobby ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly some ##place I would stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room like many say is basic but the bed is comfortable and the location is excellent , quiet and so close to some of the best restaurants and shops . Being English we wanted a cup of tea in the morning and they don ' t offer a k ##ett ##le or anything , we looked at the room service and it was $ 9 . . . . . that ' s just stupid in my opinion . Having said this , based on location , cost ( wasn ' t too expensive for the room compared to others ) and comfort , I ' d probably stay again . Oh and very brave with the cream carpet ##s . . . . quite a few stain ##s upon entering the room . . . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was extremely pleased with my stay . The staff was friendly , the facility was clean , the room was spacious , and the location was perfect . My room had a beautiful view of the river . There were so many great options for food , including their amazing stake house , St ##ets ##ons ! I would absolutely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have just returned home from staying three nights at the suites . Can ##not recommend this accommodation more highly . Complete suite - bedroom / en suite / sitting area / kitchen which was fully equipped . Very clean , com ##fy bed . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast and during weekday evenings - compliment ##ary small Dinner - beer / wine included . Really really nice . Pleasant staff throughout the building . Really nice feel about the building . Re ##lax ##ed and well equipped . Excellent location for all downtown locations including transportation / sights / shopping . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the views and location of the hotel . The hotel was well staffed for NY ##E and kept their composure despite the anti ##cs of some guests . Response to the ma ##rri ##ott app chat was quick and efficient . Park ##ing was very expensive and we were not fans of the mini bar with pressure sensors automatically charging guests . Will still stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 3 nights to meet up with family . Not a great start . . . found Bobby pin and some blood in our bed . E ##w ##w . . . the dealt with it immediately giving us a night for free plus changing bed . After that . . . I loved everything about this place . Friendly employees , beautiful decorations , great food and drink ! Would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first time at this hotel ( or any luxury hotel ) for that matter . I was there in Chicago for 6 days on a business trip and had a lovely stay here at Ki ##nz ##ie . They also have happy hour from 5 - 7 where I could go and un ##wind after a long day and have a cold beer and relax . The bartender there , Josh , was the sweet ##est thing ever and really made my stay better with good conversation and laughs ! They have dog friendly rooms so I was able to bring my dog with me . We were a 4 minutes from the river walk and would go there to walk every morning and evening . It was the perfect location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was smaller this year than last and I wish there had been a microwave . The staff were professional . The stairs connected to the older parts of the building , were such a treat to discover . Prior to this visit , we have stayed here 7 times . We prefer to use cash for the $ 50 extra security , but the staff member did not allow that this time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] History and grand ##eur o ##oz ##e at this hotel . It has been beautifully restored and the service matches the elegant style . It is also situated on the L , by the theater district , great restaurants and shopping from Target to Macy ' s . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is one of the most comfortable and beautiful hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying at . The rooms are stunning and the views are incredible ; especially at night when the city is all lit up . From the customer service , to the ta ##sty room service , to the incredible welcome . . . I could ask for more . This hotel is a must when in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was beautiful . While busy on the lobby floors , the hallway ##s and rooms were quiet and relaxing respectively . Thanks to staff member William O ##ls ##rud , who gave me the opportunity to really take advantage of my new H ##H membership . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved on a Sunday to a fantastic and very efficient check in / arrival process . Beautiful , clean , and modern property . Room was comfortable , clean , and had every am ##eni ##ty . Hu ##u ##u ##uge TV , extremely com ##fy bed and pillow , and large bathroom area . One of the best hotel experiences we ’ ve ever had . Staff was very helpful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Based on visit late October , a ##pologies for ta ##rdy posting , m working through a back ##log . Great location , interesting Art Dec ##o d ##é ##cor , great service , reasonable price for location and quality , Strong recommendation . Room ##s are comfortable , and well appointed . Not overly large but that ' s not uncommon in older US cities . One point to note is that not all the river view rooms have cushion ##s on their window bench / ledge ( as shown in their photos ) ; if you want to sit ad ##miring the view then try get a room that does . N ##B : The cocktail hour ‘ wine tasting ’ could easily be missed , the wines were , well , very basic , shall we say . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good experience overall with the following exceptions : - The snack ##s in the room mini ##bar were s ##tale ( specially considering the price ) - The yoga class scheduled for the morning by the pool never happened ( without any note to guests ) - The pool is beautiful , but being an Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal hotel , I missed not having a J ##ac ##uz ##zi . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel has thin walls and is noisy when so ##ph ##omo ##ric guests stay . Staff addresses noise issue but they need a guard on every floor during the night . People were running , yelling , up and down halls and stairs well into the night . There was noise until 3 ##AM both Friday & Saturday nights . Thursday & Sunday nights were quiet . They sold us into an upgrade when we checked in and when we complained nights 2 & 3 they were willing to move us night 4 to a smaller room without any reduction is cost . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The property was great . It was spot on with CO ##VI ##D procedures ! It offered a great room . I loved the proximity to so many restaurants and shopping . Close to the lake ! You did not need a car to get around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t is a great little bout ##ique hotel . Excellent , friendly service and very clean . Breakfast at the restaurant was fantastic . The bell ##men were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting with rides , advice , and directions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a amazing time right in central Chicago . Dave at the front was awesome took good care of us . we will be back to visit . They were helpful about places to visit . Room was nice and big . Just wish I had a better view not the alley . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very helpful getting any issues resolved during my stay . Eva was especially helpful throughout the entirety of my stay . She was able to help me through the booking issues I had . The event rooms are great as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is wonderful , but it ' s the service that makes the difference . At check in , Joshua demonstrated his five star customer service with me . I had an issue , and special request . He took care of it right away , and quickly I was in the perfect room for my stay . The rest of the stay was without event . For any issue I had , I knew , based on the example of Joshua , that the staff was customer obsessed . They knew how to take care of it , and they did . I always tell people to " if you have an issue , let them know about it . It quickly shows you how well they are trained to take care of you ' . Then decide if you want to stay loyal and return . I will return to s ##wi ##sso ##tel on my next trip to Chicago , without question ! Thank you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here last night . The hotel was great ! The whole theme is very “ Great G ##ats ##by ” . David , who checked us in was so friendly . We had free champagne at social hour . The room was on the smaller side , but perfect for my husband and I . Bed was comfortable and pillows were amazing . We were on the 10th floor and had no noise complaints . The location was perfect for what we were doing . The late check out is amazing too . No complaints here ! And we will definitely be coming back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at this Hilton about 1 / 2 a dozen times over the years and it ' s always my first pick whenever I ' m in Chicago . The proximity to Field Museum / She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , Grant Park , Millennium Park , Maggie Daly Park , shopping , food , the list goes on - it ' s perfect . The hotel itself has a classic feel to it but with very modern finishes to the rooms . The rooms are always very clean , the staff is very at ##ten ##tive , and the pool is great for my little boys . The in - house coffee shop is very handy and staff there is also very helpful . Kitty ' s is a fun spot to hit for dinner if you don ' t want to search for a place that isn ' t super busy in the area , but still has good food . Overall , I will continue to pick this hotel with each visit to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I decided to surprise my wife with a quick get away to Chicago . They made her birthday extra special by having a delicious dessert waiting for us in the room upon our arrival . The room had a very new and modern feel and was very clean . We both found the bed to be one of the most comfortable beds we have slept in . The pillow top with a more firm mattress was quite pleasant . The staff was all very helpful and friendly . The location was perfect for us as we enjoyed walking around the magnificent mile and Rush street . We both can ' t wait to stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great space in the heart of the River North neighborhood . Quiet , spacious , comfortable , nice gym , mac in the business center , free breakfast available on every floor ( just bring the tray provided in your room ) . Breakfast included fresh squeezed juice , a p ##let ##hora of baked goods , hard boiled eggs , etc . Free app ##eti ##zers at the lounge between 5 - 8 ##pm daily on 6th floor . The app ##eti ##zers ( good blue cheese , man ##che ##go , etc . are a step above the normal compliment ##ary offerings ) . The staff is focused on providing excellent Custom ##er Service . I look forward to returning to the wonderful city of Chicago and the Ki ##nz ##ie . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Here for business and stayed for the weekend . Great location , walk ##able to everything , great staff . Very friendly and helpful . Great food . The Belgian wa ##ffles at Center Court are to die for . Could use some more furniture to sit on in the living area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying here . Stay ##ed one night on New Years Eve and was pleasant ##ly surprised by the level of service and the large clean friendly room . Will def ##ent ##iel ##y stay here again with looking for a place in downtown . [SEP]
0	[CLS] F ##lew in for thanks ##gi ##ving and do tourist ##y things . Couldn ’ t have asked for a more comfortable stay at the Mill ##eni ##um ! The bed was so com ##fy and the pillows soft ! Just what I needed after a busy day walking around Chicago ! Very clean room with plenty of space ! Also no noise from outside which was good ! Staff were friendly and helpful ! Would definitely return when visiting Chicago again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here on an incredible travel ##zo ##o deal and it was wonderful . El ##egan ##t lovely appointed lobby or " living room " . My room was small but beautifully appointed . . . the modern bathroom had plenty of room . Though I was near the elevator it was very quiet . The bed was incredibly com ##fy . The social hour was fun . . . although was told there would be something for kids . There wasn ' t . Free New York Times in the morning was nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The location of the hotel is outstanding it ’ s close by everything , The friend ##liness of the staff and customer service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble I would recommend this hotel anytime you come to Chicago . The lobby restaurant Michael Jordan ##s was very good staff was extremely friendly overall experience was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is exactly what young and hip travelers or event plan ##ners are looking for . They have a unique take on service that ' s helpful without being invasive . Their food and beverage menu ##s are also fresh and interesting . Food quality is top notch and delicious . A ##V team is tried and true PS ##AV but with an on - site staff that ' s efficient and pre ##em ##pt ##ive in problem solving . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room and comfortable bed . Room was decorated nicely and not out of date . Clean room and quiet . Great view from high level floor . Staff is very helpful at the Front Des ##k . Room Service was delivered promptly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##led for business and stayed for 4 nights . Room ##s were larger than normal and quite comfortable . Location is amazing ( close proximity to Michigan Avenue and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ) so was able to do some incredible shopping while I was in Chicago . Hotel is enormous and service is quite imp ##erson ##al . Had made numerous requests for service to the room and often had to call numerous times before someone finally showed up . Club lounge was possibly one of the worst I ' ve experienced globally . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got to the Swiss ##ote ##l late on a Wednesday - Let ##s just say it was not a happy start to our stay here . Room wasn ' t what we reserved , bathroom door didn ' t close , items missing from the room ( ex . robes , in - room dining menu ) among other things . When we called down to the evening manager he was un - helpful and said there was nothing he could do aside from a 25 % discount on our in - room dining . Then the bill came up with no discount ##ed added . The next morning we called down to a new manager , J ##acy ##ln - SH ##E WA ##S AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! She immediately apologized for our evening and was eager to make our stay the best it could be . She bright ##ened our vacation and earned a frequent fly ##er here at the Swiss ##ote ##l . Thank you J ##acy ##ln - your hospitality is re ##f ##reshing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chicago O ##m ##ni is a wonderful family friendly option located right on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The staff is extremely friendly , helpful and polite . The facility is well maintained . Like most Chicago hotels , the indoor pool is small but sufficient for the children . The work ##out room is clean with lots of equipment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a fantastic stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago - Pedro at check - in was first class with his service and even gave us a v ##ou ##cher for some free drinks at the bar as we were on honeymoon . He checked us is swiftly and his recommendations for places to go and things to do were great , and he is an asset to the hotel . We had a junior suite with views out to Lake Michigan and we were delighted with it . Really com ##fy bed , great TV , good shower and silent at night time . All the staff here are professional , at ##ten ##tive and friendly and next time we visit Chicago we ' ll stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is spectacular . The lobby is visually stunning . The staff are mostly court ##eous and the food is exceptional . However . . . . . My GO ##D the prices here are really scary . The rooms are nothing special , there were long lines for the breakfast and the lady at the end of the line was far from pleasant . I enjoyed my stay here but at $ 340 A room , $ 13 A beer , and $ 70 for a steak and chips with coffee and a very me ##dio ##cre room I felt this place was w ##oe ##fully expensive ! On my last morning I was told that there were no breakfast places available . So I had to go to a nearby convenience store for some fruit . At such an expensive hotel this is simply not acceptable . Speaking personally I would not return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here while on a short business trip to Chicago - they have breakfast each morning on every floor so you can just grab something g and go back to your room . Room ##s are plenty big with great I . Room ##s facilities . Free drinks During happy out with token ##s you are given on check in - great place to stay and working leaking distance of the mile and shopping not to mention my meeting venue . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Room ##s a little dated and s ##tale . Staff were good . Vale ##t guys were very friendly . Park ##ing is a little price ##y but convenient . I would stay here again if there was a deal on pricing . Market coffee shop was good for a quick breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We flew out from NJ for a friend ' s wedding . I also had the honor of performing their ceremony so this was a work ##ation weekend . The con ##cier ##ge has been fantastic . They have a text ##ing option so I was able to reach out to them easily and they responded quickly . They arranged an early check - in for my party so we could get cleaned up , iron ##ed and ready in time for the early rehearsal . The rooms are small , but you should expect that in a historical building . Image is of our King room from the doorway . Bath ##room is to my left . My husband is 6 ##ft + and 200 + so he felt a bit cramped . The am ##bian ##ce and g ##enia ##l staff make up for that . The art de ##co throughout is beautiful ! Makes me want to dress up and drink ma ##rt ##ini ##s in the lobby . Thanks for a great stay folks ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was really nice to come back to crash to in the evenings . Had enough character that it didn ' t feel like every hotel you stayed at before and the staff were really at ##ten ##tive . The wine reception was enjoyable the first evening I was there . The k ##im ##pton rewards are definitely worth it as well . I look forward to staying at more Kim ##pton hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff , nice suites with king bed with roll away couch . . . needed to switch from suite to standard room with 2 double beds because roll away not sufficient for our needs . . . but overall was a good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Phantom was in town and it couldn ' t have been more convenient being right next door . Bed ##s and pillows were u ##ber com ##fy . No negative ##s at all here . High ##ly recommended and cannot wait for another visit . Also this was our first stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] As a frequent guest at the Talbot ##t Hotel in Chicago for almost ten years , it seems to get better and better with each visit . Each and every member of the staff will really go out of their way to accommodate your every need , and that ' s what makes this hotel so special . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed in an Executive King Suite with our 3 small children . Room service was at ##ten ##tive and made sure we were fully stock ##ed with towels , as well as turning down bed service every evening . On the down side , the bed was hollow , my husband and I woke up every morning stuck in the middle and with sore backs . I would recommend for those who are looking for a competent friendly staff . A place to stay is only a place to stay if you are not welcome in to one ' s home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t have a single complaint , rooms are nice and clean , bathroom had tons of room , staff was top notch and friendly , location was perfect ( walking distant to everything ) , could not have asked for a better place to stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve had the pleasure of hosting events here and I would like to thank Ya ##vis Soto and her team for an incredible evening ! You helped me to provide an incredible ceremony and dinner for our students and their guests . I highly recommend the Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago for your special events . [SEP]
1	[CLS] With the help of some key staff , Ma ##mie Lee in house ##keeping , Mo in the Lock ##wood Lo ##bby Bar , and Manager D ##T Love , we managed to finish our trip feeling satisfied . The problems seem to be bigger Hilton issues , like not great food in that executive level lounge that you pay extra for , no coffee makers in the rooms until you call down and request it ( and that may take hours and hours to fulfill ) , and posting pictures on the Palmer website that are not representative of what you are getting . If you hope for the best and fully expect the typical , you will be ok , and with the help of the staff , you might come out feeling a little bit like you won . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room was nice . The view was amazing . Park ##ing was high but that ’ s Chicago . Check ##ing in was such a breeze and everyone was so nice and helpful . I wish k ##ore restaurants were in walking distance of the hotel but just door ##das ##hed my food for the night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 29th floor has amazing view of Mill ##eni ##um Park . Hotel needs updated for the price you pay . Everyone is super friendly and nice and but for 34 ##1 . 00 a night the rooms could have been more updated with new carpet and new furniture . The fridge did not work and the furniture was worn and ta ##ttered . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice sized room and comfortable bed . Not enough drawer space in the room . More lights would have been nice Excellent staff . Could have had a better shower . Great location . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary water and good w ##i fi [SEP]
1	[CLS] Did a pre paid room and decided to upgrade . Big mistake ! The hotel said $ 20 a night but fails to convey that they will now double charge you for tax , service and facility fees on the double room ; which you already paid on the pre paid room ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have been making an annual Thanksgiving Week trip to the Palmer House in downtown Chicago . This year we did not come in until Thursday morning . We Love the Palmer House and have ##v ##ne ##ver been disappointed . This year we had to wait 3 1 / 2 hours for our room and then we ' re texted to go to room 113 only to find out after we get to room 113 that the room 170 and would need to return to the front desk for new keys ! Luckily a housing supervisor came to our rescue and called down and let us in so we did not have to return downstairs . She has a bell ##man bring us up keys . We were disappointed in 2018 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very awkward setup with an elevator to get to lobby / check - in desk . There wasn ' t always someone there so it was a bit odd . From there , the room service food was way over - priced and was not good . They need to work on sign ##age that outlines check - in lobby is upstairs . Also put more focus into fresh quality foods ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second stay and it was ma ##rve ##lous . The Gold Lounge staff were incredibly helpful and friendly . Thanks to Sharon , T ##ip ##hani , and Mu ##gi , each of whom went to great lengths to help with our stay . The lake ##front rooms are bright and spacious , the service at all levels is excellent , and the am ##bian ##ce warm and relaxed . If you are going to the Art Institute , on architectural tours , to the Symphony or the Opera , this is the place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have to qualify this review by saying it was newly opened after Co ##vid - 19 shut ##down so restaurants not open and no room service or maid service but management very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting with fresh towels and trash removal and other requests [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is nice , clean , and welcoming . It is just a few blocks from the Michigan Avenue shopping area . The staff is professional , helpful , and they go out of their way to make your stay better . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is one of my favorite stops once a year or once every other year . The house ##keeping staff will take care of all of your needs . The front desk is good but really don ' t have the time to get to know the guest because they are so busy . The fitness facility is top - notch but if you are there for a conference you may have to adjust your normal work ##out routine . I will definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is amazing . Ron helped us out at the front desk and was so up ##beat and helpful . All jokes ! Very high ceilings in the room made for a great experience ! A great gym and also a great restaurant all in house . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended a conference where the breakfast b ##uff ##et was horrible and the lunch b ##uff ##et was to ##ler ##able . H ##ya ##tt was advised of nut and seed all ##er ##gy prior to conference but did not offer an alternative to dishes served with nuts or seeds . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a unique and beautiful old piece of history in Chicago , and the rooms have been updated so it ' s also a very nice place to stay . And the service was top shelf . At first I got a tiny room without a fridge even , so I texted , and Destiny immediately fixed the problem and got me a nice room . She made the change right away , with no trouble . All very pleasant . I will come back here next time I am in town . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad is a great hotel just off The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! The service was great and the amenities and restaurant were outstanding as well . The rooms are very spacious and well appointed with anything you would need for a very comfortable stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is great ! The staff always goes the extra mile to make sure guests are comfortable and satisfied . Room ##s are really clean and very comfortable . It is located in a very busy part of the city - - which is great - - but expect city noise . Traffic , sire ##ns and most notably the L which is loud and sq ##ue ##ak ##y . We heard it the first night so we downloaded a white noise app to our phone and used it to cover the sound . Problem solved ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Whilst the impression was that the hotel had seen better days it did have a very nice am ##bian ##ce . The location was very good and our room was quite reasonable for a city centre hotel . However , there were some down ##side ##s , in particular there was no room service which was very surprising , and we were referred to the bar if we wanted anything . Unfortunately , the service at the bar was very slow and they seemed short of staff . The was a restaurant but it only served breakfast which whilst OK was over ##p ##rice ##d for what you got . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here two nights on a recent visit to Chicago ( mother / daughter trip ) . The staff was great , very helpful to any requests we had or questions . The room was very nice and we had a great view of the river and Lake Michigan . Very unexpected since I didn ' t upgrade to pay for a lake view room . Bed ##s were com ##fy , great pillows , very clean room . The location is perfect also . We walked almost everywhere we went ( 25 plus miles ) and used L ##y ##ft to get to places further away . Lots of places nearby to eat and drink . I recommend Egg ##y ' s Din ##er & Wild ##berry Cafe for breakfast ##s . G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s close by for pizza and the River ##walk has lots of options too . We did not try their restaurant but it looked very nice . Would definitely stay here again when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had stayed several times at this hotel some years ago for business purposes . Now that we went back to Chicago decided to try it again . Great Place and Value Excellent location , rooms in very good shape . Price is reasonable . Staff friendly and very good with customers . Room ##s are very good size for a 4 people family ( 2 adults + 2 kids ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived early in the am , hotel had a room waiting for us - an upgrade . . . . . the staff was great , friendly and very helpful . Breakfast in the morning was good . great location , walked everywhere . . . . Hotel very clean and it was great to have a full kitchen . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable and fresh , beautiful ve ##nu ( King Arthur ’ s court , Came ##lot Room ) and excellent food at the conference and breakfast at Center Court . Michael Jordan ’ s is f ##abulous . Right on magnificent mile ( Nord ##strom , River ##walk , Water Tower all within walking distance ! ) . Book early for spa amenities ! AL ##L staff were so kind and at ##ten ##tive ! Worth every cent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s been years since we spent the night in Chicago , and didn ’ t know what to expect , luck ##ily we decided to stay at Home ##wood Suite ##s by Hilton . Our room was spot ##less , the staff was super friendly as well . The only issue with our stay is that we didn ’ t have a bottle opener for our wine ( I ’ m not a huge fan of wine , but my girlfriend is ) , however we called the front desk to see if we could get one , and within 5 minutes we had one , pretty impressive , especially being on the 17th floor , by the way , the view from the 17th floor was amazing ! We highly recommend this hotel , and plan on staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very solid property on all fronts . Staff and location are exceptional , and the property is well maintained as a 4 star hotel . Very good bar and restaurant . Upper floors give fine views of downtown and lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quite O ##asis in the centre of Chicago . This Old Lady needs some re shining and will again become a Mill ##ennial Pearl of excellent location . The rooms have dark interior and could win if refurbished . The view of the Lake sharp and beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is a wonderful hotel . The room and bathroom are very clean and nice quality . The food and bar is great too . Great location right on magnificent mile and right next to the new star ##bu ##cks . Overall great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont is an older hotel well located near Millennium Park in Chicago . Our room looked to have been recently updated . The bathroom was very nice and the bed quite com ##fy . Located on a high floor , there was a great view of Lake Michigan . I was impressed by the speed ##y elevators that always seemed to be there waiting for you to w ##his ##k you down to the lobby or back up to your room . Sign up for the free President ' s club in order to receive free internet during your stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was small but beautifully decorated . Bath ##room made up for bedroom size with large tub and separate shower and great toilet ##ries . Gorge ##ous hotel overall but definitely one to book for business or adults - only stay . Would return without children but traveling with my 2 young kids to visit their dad who was in Chicago for work we received many rude stares from other patrons of the hotel . Vale ##t cost $ 75 which seems ridiculous - we ’ ve stayed at many similar hotels across the country and never paid more than $ 50 . Staff was friendly and hotel is in a great location to do anything you want in Chicago ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend for a ladies or couples weekend - has a great bar and restaurant looked delicious . Try the diner next door if you want a more budget friendly breakfast — it was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent service . In - room dining is a wonderful experience . Be certain to try the " cookies and milk " for a late night guilty pleasure . Wonderful staff . Best we have encountered in US or abroad . Great location for events near loop and Michigan Ave . Room ##s are luxurious with very comfortable beds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were put up here for the night by Amtrak after our train was delayed and we missed our connecting train . The hotel was super clean and and we had an amazing view of the city . My only draw back was we were given a hand ##ica ##p room when it wasn ' t needed . I don ' t know if they were grasping at rooms to give out or what but it was odd . The toilet was weird ##ly tall for my short legs , it had a standing shower with a cu ##rt ##in that went to the floor and water got everywhere , she shower head was on a handle that kept swinging making it hard to wash my hair and there was a night ##light in the bathroom that we couldn ' t turn off . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the second year I ' ve stayed at H ##ya ##tt do to a it conference at the hotel . It is always an enjoyable experience , although a little more price ##y than some others in the area . It is worth the extra price for a quiet room with great amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is very convenient for shopping on Michigan Ave / Miracle Mile . The rooms are clean and fairly well appointed , but be sure to get a room at the end of a hallway . It is a 1920 ' s hotel , so the mid - hallway rooms are quite small . Unfortunately not much of the 1920 ' s charm remains and some of the public spaces are a little worn . Room itself was nice & bathroom was spacious and modern . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ##m not into writing reviews , but what happened today at this specific Hilton was out of the normal and heart ##warm ##ing and need to be addressed and let some skeptical people out there know that there are still amazing professional management that do it from the heart no matter what . Had breakfast with friends and we are in town for business . First the food was excellent and no comments on that . But what made it O ##UT ##ST ##AN ##DI ##NG is the service and professional ##ism from this specific manager that went above and beyond to be sure we are happy . Jay A ? Thank you so much for a great experience and we will be back to this historic property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has s ##chi ##zophrenia . Some of the staff are amazing ( Front Des ##k and Bar ) and some are at ##ro ##cious ( Security ) and some weren ' t there ( House ##keeping ) . The room sucked . Don ' t bother to pay for the " upgraded " rooms . Te ##rrible view and next to ice makers I ##d ##k . . . Chicago has a bunch of great hotels that are constantly great . . . I would recommend some ##place else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a weekend in Chicago at the O ##m ##ni in early September . The hotel is above average . The rooms were well appointed and clean . The location for exploring Chicago is superb . The hotel is right around the corner from Michigan Avenue with subway stations a few blocks away . We chose the O ##m ##ni based upon rates during a very busy football and baseball weekend in Chicago . The O ##m ##ni is a safe choice when traveling to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great time at the O ##m ##ni . Everything was clean and staff was very friendly . Location was great right on the magnificent mile and all the stores . I would highly recommend this hotel as they are very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting [SEP]
1	[CLS] There are several + ' s and - ' s with this hotel . The location is outstanding . . . close to the river , Ma ##g Mile and Navy Pier . The daily breakfast on every floor is very good and a great idea because it makes breakfast very convenient . There are several very good restaurants nearby , particularly Siena Tavern and Un ##titled . The Trump Tower is close as well . The few negative ##s include no exhaust fan in the bathroom and noise from the alley behind the hotel . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was nice , comfortable beds , coffee shop was good , view from our room was not special , however the view from the lobby was beautiful . Vale ##t and front desk were very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Good Work trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Conrad for our 25th anniversary . Re ##ceived a Diamond upgrade at check in to a corner suite . Very nice room and service for stay . We received a bottle of champagne and t ##ruff ##les as a gift from guest services mg ##r to celebrate our anniversary - very nice touch . The Conrad is very central ##ly locate ##s to Michigan Avenue and all downtown attractions in Chicago . Property is among the best Hilton Honors properties we had visited . I would highly recommend this hotel on a visit to downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t to Chicago to get married . Stay ##ed at the So ##fit ##el . . . Perfect location , perfect staff , perfect room . I ' d definitely recommend this place to anyone and cannot wait to return . Park ##ing is $ 70 / night is the only negative . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So it appears Hilton allowed someone to charge restaurant charges to my room and didn ’ t check the name or if I ’ d the person . After 10 phone calls and a week later still un ##res ##ol ##ved . . . . . . . poor customer service [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , comfortable clean quiet room , very friendly staff , good amenities . Single cup coffee maker in room . Breakfast , lunch , dinner facilities on - site . Business center , spa , fitness center . Easy / fast check in and check out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in the perfect location . Only thing wrong with this trip was the sadness in seeing Michigan Avenue boarded up . Sick ##ening to see the magnificent mile turned into a battlefield with homeless every 20 feet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s excellent , very clean . Great location , very close to Rush street where good restaurants and stores are . Staff very friendly . Great bread and food , the bar is great and they give you two drinks for free . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk staff are rude and arrogant , you pay a premium price you expect premium service . At the hotel they tried charging for extra ##s that we never had , same as the other party that traveled with us . We got home 2 days ago and after checking my bank account they have decided to take another $ 49 out of my account . Called to see what it for and all i got was a very rude and abrupt woman who just laughed and said there ##s no one available , when asked for her name she just hi ##ng up . Also we paid for a room with lake and city views , what we actually got was a city and building view . When I brought this to there attention the answer was you need to go north for a lake view ! ! Funny that when the lake is east ! ! Never again would i stay here [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , walking distance ( 20 min ) to Millennium Park , Art Institute . . . friendly staff and renovated rooms . Vale ##t parking or cash garage across the street . Loop train is a block away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel ! Staff was very friendly . Bed ##s were comfortable and rooms were clean . Bath ##room was a good size , which is hard to find in the older hotels . Right in the heart of down town , close to parks and other tourist attractions . comfortable beds and clean rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment you walk in until the moment you check out , the staff is friendly and take care of you . The con ##cier ##ge was extremely helpful . The room was beautiful and the view spectacular . I was within walking distance of everything . High ##ly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect for downtown adventures , tours , shopping etc . The staff is great , the rooms are clean and t ##idy and price is very competitive for a major city hotel . Be sure to ask for at least a partial view when you book . They were quite a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting even though we were booked into a fairly low rate category . We didn ' t eat in the restaurant but did stop in for a drink . Fun v ##ibe and high quality cocktail ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gorge ##ous hotel ! Travel ##ed with kids , so we were unable to enjoy the restaurant or bar , but we will come back . Love the part of town it was in . Close to shopping and dining , but off the beaten path a little , so it wasn ' t too busy . Love ##d the simplicity of the de ##cor in the room . Friendly staff and allowed us early check in , and held onto our bags after check out so we could continue to explore the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The M ##K ##C has come through for me from the start and did once again this past weekend . A delight ##ful hotel with a very friendly staff . The location , for me , is ideal . There ' s much to like about the M ##K ##C but there is one thing that stands out : Having live entertainment in the lobby . L ##O ##VE IT ! Hope to see you again in 2018 : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Chicago H ##ya ##tt Regency is located on the south bank of the river , just north of Grant Park and right at the entrance to the Miracle Mile . The rooms are clean and modern , lobby is huge with several good eating options , and it is very close to everything . My only reason for not rating as a 5 was that the room was not cleaned on Sunday , which would have been greatly appreciated . I stayed there for the Chicago Marathon and was ideal ##ly located for the race . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 63 ##25 Nice historic hot ##s ##l Review of Palmer House A Hilton Hotel Pen ##ding review I ' ve stayed at the Palmer House several times . The hotel is very nice , but rather noisy ( thin walls ) . Great amenities , bar and spacious rooms , but simply noisy when compared to other rooms . The beds are comfortable , bathroom ##s are clean with great Hilton amenities . If the person in the next door room is playing the television with a moderate volume , you will enjoy listening to their program . This is really my only dislike about the hotel . I like the value for a nice hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If staying downtown , this is my first choice . The people care and it shows . I love this place ! They will answer any question and the food in the bar is y ##um ##my ! The location allows you to go anywhere down ##t ##won [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Intercontinental Thursday - Sunday . The staff were friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and helpful ; and the room was clean , and comfortable . The pool area was large , and clean , with plenty of pool towels . We did not use the work ##out facility , but it was large , and had plenty of equipment . The hotel is convenient ##ly located near many shops and restaurants . We ordered / carried out pizza from La ##B ##rio ##la , and don ##uts from Stan ' s Don ##uts . We visited the Field Museum and She ##dd A ##qua ##rium - a short U ##ber ride , and walked back to the hotel . We are looking forward to staying here again in the future ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel for one night at the end of our trip and wished I had booked it at the beginning as well . From the moment we stepped foot the front desk was excellent , we had checked in mobile - l ##y and our room was ready and waiting . The room 160 ##2 was amazing , the cu ##rva ##ture gave us lots of space and woke up to a view of the Ferris wheel . The hotel is H ##U ##GE but still felt co ##zy , Located close to the pier , but still near the center of town . Great water views , well worth the stop ! Can ' t wait to go back again . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! ! Near tourist attractions , shops , restaurants and bars but road didn ’ t feel too busy . Staff all professional . Con ##cier ##ges really helpful , especially with recommend ##ing food / drink places . Room was lovely ( we did get an upgrade to a junior suite so not sure what our original room would have been like but room was modern and clean and com ##fy so pre ##sume all rooms similar in standard . ) At ##e breakfast in the hotel - nice menu and service and although a little price ##y , it did seem in keeping with the area and wasn ’ t anymore expensive than local eat ##eries . Only down ##side - the area in general seemed expensive to eat / drink . Oh and coffee in the room would have been better , but it was nice to at least have compliment ##ary coffee in lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel surprised me with the ni ##nja service ! The door people and the Main ##tain ##ance people were great . The automatic blind ##s and the larger TV made my room that much more enjoyable . Stay here ! You won ' t regret it ! [SEP]

0	[CLS] We were staying at the All ##egro for a night in the city to celebrate my friends birthday . We were greeted at the front desk by De ##ja Tate . She was incredibly helpful and gave us suggestions of places to go in the city as we are not from the area . We ended up going to one of her suggestions and had such a fun night . She also gave us a late check out because we got back to the hotel late . She made our experience amazing and we definitely will be back ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] This was an overall present stay . The staff were friendly and professional . The location was central ##ly located . There were several restaurants within walking distance of the hotel . The only complaint is that the hair in the drain of the bath ##tub needed to be removed . The bath ##tub did not drain . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for one night to attend Cubs / Cardinals games on back to back days . We originally chose the Ki ##nz ##ie because of the lower price compared to others in the area . We are so happy with our choice . The rooms and entire hotel were clean and modern . The furnishings seemed very new and well - kept . The breakfast was an added bonus . I appreciated having both healthy and sweet choices , and didn ' t need to run out to find something to eat in the morning . The beds were extremely comfortable ! I would definitely recommend the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel and can ' t wait to stay again soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff here is excellent , inform ##ative and friendly . Very helpful , the hotel is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , the room perfect and room service beyond re ##p ##roach .

1	[CLS] We stayed on a f ##rida ##y night and we weren ' t dressed as nice as we should be , but the front desk couldn ' t of been nice ##r , we were on the 18th floor which was great and the view was limited . The location was awesome for us even though we didn ' t go to the theater , this area was perfect for walking everywhere , very user friendly and safe . A little expensive but we were in downtown Chicago . Room was small and bathroom was tiny but service ##able and everything was clean , and the staff was very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel sits right off the water and we had a perfect view . The room was nice and clean , my only issue is having to rent a refrigerator if needed . We had food left over from the restaurant and would have thought this hotel had in room refrigerator ##s . . . no ##pe , not the ##r case . Had a re ##f ##rig ##erated bar with over ##p ##rice ##d drinks and snack ##s instead . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in the heart of Chicago . Nice , spacious rooms . . . but the heat was either way too hot or not hot enough . . . Only negative is that it ' s located across from the Fire Department . My room , unfortunately overlooked the Fire Department so heard the sire ##ns quite often . Had a bowl of soup in the restaurant and it was taste ##less . In fact , most of the food I ate in my three days there was nothing special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel In the middle of ni ##chi ##gen A ##v Walking distance from the pier . And From the mile ##nium park . S ##wi ##ming pool on the 12th floor . 3 restaurants on the ground level And great breakfast b ##uff ##et . Check ##in was slow . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for four night while working in Chicago , from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty . The room was as you would expect at a hotel of this caliber , spacious , spot ##less and everything you would expect . I had a view of the pier through the neighbouring buildings . I walked two minutes to Michigan Ave where I shop ##ped and eat each night . Great hotel , recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel welcome ##s you in a very professional and friendly way . The lounge and lobby area are great for meeting someone . The staff are knowledge ##able , efficient and kind and are understanding of your needs . The rooms are a bit small for my liking , but that is typical of a Chicago high rise hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The de ##cor was truly beautiful at this hotel . When we checked in , Leah was happy to see us and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Our room was well appointed , and had everything you could ask for in a mini bar and in snack ##s and small essential ##s . Our only problem was with the elevator . . . cause that was a problem . They did give us a free lunch at the 312 for our in ##con ##ven ##ience which was very generous ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The friend ##liest hotel ! Great location ! Large rooms , excellent staff . The door ##men made the O ##m ##ni Chicago and an especially wonderful experience .

1	[CLS] This last visit was my third stay at this hotel . The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful . The lobby lounge is small , but works well - very nice chairs by the fire . The rooms are beautiful , beds are comfortable and just overall a great place to stay . Good location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m a fan of Kim ##pton hotels as they are more bout ##ique and like the unique style . This hotel is central ##ly located and in walking distance to many Chicago attractions . We upgraded to a water view room , which provided for good views of the city and the river . Hotel provides free bike rental ##s but you have to pay for W ##i ##F ##i , unless you are a rewards member . Not a fan of " nickel ##ing and dim ##ing " over W ##i ##F ##i , which should be compliment ##ary . Staff was friendly and eager to help . Overall , great location and a fun hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We celebrated both of our children ' s birthday ##s while stay on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! The American Doll Experience is worth it ! ! They also custom ##ized our visit so our son was included too ! The mini ##bar [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was very busy given it was the weekend after Christmas . Hotel / room was ok - - odd layout of the bathroom and the rooms would not cool down . Bed was comfortable and the breakfast was great . S ##hout out to Julius Do ##xy at the from desk who was very persona ##ble and pleasant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff here was welcoming and very helpful . Location is very convenient for anyone wanting to walk to any of the popular tourist areas . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary w ##if ##i would sure be nice , but we enjoyed our stay . Also earned 240 ##00 Southwest points for booking which was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have a wedding emergency right now . And I ' m being told the hotel does not have management on the weekends . Someone named Mark said he would pass along my time - sensitive emergency to someone who will respond sometime after 9 ##am on Monday . Mark was extremely rude . We checked out today from Room 250 ##2 , so you know who we are . I told Mark I was going to social media with how I ' m being treated and he invited me to do so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the newly renovated room . Their happy hour and breakfast , so good . Their new lobby is so cute and inviting . The only thing I dislike is the expensive parking , but this last time I used the Spot ##her ##o and that saved me a lot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel rooms were comparable to budget motel rooms . They are old , walls and ceilings cracking , everything is brown ( maybe to hide the dirt ) , cleaning staff not the best . No pool . Park ##ing has gone up to $ 89 . No refrigerator for personal use . Pro ##s : Good location and nice lobby . Check in was quick and we got a late check ##out . This is not a H ##ya ##tt stay I am used to . Not for $ 230 - $ 250 a night . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a gorgeous hotel and great staff . The room I had a great view but I would request a lake view in the future . The front desk staff was at ##ten ##tive and made the stay just that more memorable . I would certainly stay at the So ##fit ##el again it the future . It was in a perfect location with it being in such close proximity to Michigan Avenue . It also was very close to some of the most fantastic restaurants located in the city of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On our first night the AC was not working . The manager claimed it was fine . The next night hot air was blowing out of the vent ##s again ! The beds were rock hard . After our room was cleaned they didn ' t leave extra towels ! We spoke with the manager who didn ' t seem to care much . Won ' t stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d our corner suite ! Nice size for four of us . Front door staff ( late in the day / evening ) very friendly . Breakfast every morning was quite good , nice variety . Nice surprise was the meet and great dinner ##s ( Monday - Thursday ) - free beer and wine too ! Location was fantastic ! Easy to get to most of our daily activities and local restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the Conrad twice in the last few months . The service has been exceptional . The front desk staff , the bell staff . . everyone we encountered was wonderful . The rooms are con ##fort ##able and include a N ##es ##press coffee maker and electric tea ##pot . . as a tea drink ##er I get quite tired of making tea by heating water in whatever coffee maker is provided . . b ##lah they tea made that way is marginal . On our most recent trip a cell ##phone was left behind in our last L ##y ##ft ride . The hotel facilitated its return by allowing the L ##y ##ft driver to drop it off and then arranged for it to be shipped to me . The bar off the lobby has an excellent selection of b ##our ##bon ##s and house made barrel aged cocktail ##s . . . in case that interests you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago in the loft room . The room was H ##U ##GE , clean , modern , and a great view of the Hancock building .

The hotel is right in the heart of Michigan Ave and close to everything . The staff was very helpful and even gave us an extra 2 h ##rs of late check out on the day we were leaving . I would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in central position along the river ##walk : convenient and nice . Good and spacious conference rooms and services . I stayed for 4 nights for a conference . I booked an upper room with river view . I must confess I expected more value for money . I think the room looked exactly at it was in the 90 ' s ( from lighting systems , small safety box with keys ! ! ! , mini bar , bathroom ' s amenities are minimal but you can request some more for free ) w ##i - fi is NO ##T free . A renovation plan is highly recommended . Breakfast is nice in the lower restaurant . Staff is kind . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a 2 day business meeting downtown and based on the location of the meeting it was suggested I stay at this hotel . I had hoped to check - in early and there were no rooms available . I left my bag with the con ##cier ##ge and received a text message later that morning when my room was ready . Given the recent Mar ##riot ##t / Star ##wood merger I was dismay ##ed to discover that my frequent stay number was not initially attached to my reservation . However , my room had a great view of the river and I was able to get free breakfast in the lounge the next day anyway . Hotel staff added my frequent stay number upon check ##out and removed the internet fee , too . Overall , the room was clean and comfortable . The " free " breakfast in the lounge was adequate but nothing special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can only hope my experience was due to having appointments in the early am and came back for my compliment ##ary breakfast . I have stayed here many times and since no lounge credit , but that has now changed to Continental Breakfast in restaurant . I was b ##unk big mistake as I always spend more then the credit . My biggest disappointment was only one option for hot , and little cereal and few past ##ries . Fruit was decent but the o ##at ##me ##al was not good and I know only o ##at ##me ##al would have given me no options had I not been off my diet ##ary restrictions . They need more options and o ##at ##me ##al was a ##w ##fu ! Be ##ware of this if you consider what is otherwise a great property . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was here this week on a quick over - night . I loved my experience at this hotel . The hotel is stunning and luxurious . First , my room was so large ; I could not believe the size . I have all ##er ##gies to feather pillows , so they sent a lovely woman to change out my pillows and the comfort ##er . She may my bed with such care ; I was truly amazed . And we had a nice conversation . The room over looked grant Park . There was street noises that I was able to hear , but all in all a good night sleep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As always , a great stay at the East Grand Ave Home ##wood suites . our 4th . We always choose this property due to location , pricing , amenities and friendly / helpful staff We will continue to do so when we visit Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at All ##egro in Chicago for a long weekend . Great Art Dec ##o design , daily happy hour in the lobby , a mix of main floor lounge ##s , and fairly high - end restaurant . Our room was small but comfortable . Our flight was cancelled and we had to stay an extra night , and we ' re upgraded at last minute . Great staff from door to reception with shout - out to Austin , who assisted my wife on a couple of occasions . [SEP]
0	[CLS] H ##U ##G ##O was amazing ! The staff was all amazing and helpful , but I cannot stress enough how fun he made our stay . He talked to us at the bar for a few hours while we planned out our day , suggested places in the city and was extremely ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . I ’ ve honestly never had a better bartender ! Am ##ela and Andy were also so great , they handled the rush and treated every guest persona ##bly they all should get raise . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Me and my wife stayed at Talbot ##t for 7 days our stay was absolutely amazing I can ##t fault them for anything very organised , professional and most importantly really friendly staff especially D ##wayne and Perry made our stay so much easier for us . Also everyone in the hotel supported and helped my wife after her surgery . We enjoyed our time and will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room in hotel was good but meeting space was not easily accessible . It was convenient walking to most destinations : restaurants , Gen ##ius Bar , shopping ; wait staff in meeting spaces were a little g ##ruff and noisy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby appearance is very pleasant . However , upon entering our room it looked like an episode out of Alice in Wonderland . The bed and side tables were extremely low to the ground . Low ceilings might explain why low beds . The construction workers outside our window early in the morning after a late night arrival was very unpleasant . Dr ##ill ##ing was so loud my husband and I could not talk to each other casually across the room . Sleeping in was not possible . We registered with an o ##cc ##up ##ancy of 3 . However , there only enough towels for 2 . Don ' t plan on staying at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the So ##fit ##el for two nights for an event in September . The property is lovely and in walking distance to Michigan Avenue . The rooms are very nice but stay on a high floor for the great views of Chicago and the lake ##front . They have a restaurant in the hotel and it was excellent for lunch . My only issue was the lighting in the bathroom as some of the bulb ##s didn ' t work but this was corrected in a time ##ly manner . The parking was a little confusing but I finally found the correct lot which was pre - booked . I would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time staying at the O ##m ##ni and it was great . I didn ' t get to see all of the amenities but the room was spacious , the king bed very comfortable and the food in the 67 ##6 Restaurant was outstanding . The location on Michigan Avenue was ideal for my travels and made my morning com ##mu ##te easy to handle . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good place to be at , if you want to be in the middle of Chicago . Close to Navy Pier , Train Station , and Bus ##es run throughout the day and night . All other amenities are close by . Good and heart ##y breakfast , with evening social during weekdays . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my first experience with Hotel Kim ##pton . And it was f ##abulous . Staff ##s are very friendly . feeling like i visited one of my family . Room was clean and interior was by far special . Location was perfect . close to L train , and bus stop . I want to visit another Kim ##pton hotel when I visit other cities in States . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3 girlfriend ##s and myself stayed at this hotel over the last weekend in April . The room was nice , the bathroom was large , and the view was spectacular . The only issue that I had with this hotel is that to get 2 beds instead of 1 , we had to pay an extra $ 35 plus taxes per night . That was unexpected and a little annoying . But , it didn ' t ruin our trip . The hotel is nicely located and has a fun bar downstairs . The staff was nice . Not a bad place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A homeless guy walking around the hotel facilities , in front of the view of the front desk staff at 11 ##pm . Any ##body can enter with no restrictions to the hotel , no security at all and putting in risk to every guest in the hotel . A total neglected attitude by the hotel staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lou ##d neighbors Bath towels were not replaced No compensation was provided Check out efficiency was terrible Room was comfortable but not many chairs View wasn ' t great Had requested for a good view of the lake but just got it facing another hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful Hotel with wonderful staff . Special thanks to Al ##en the door ##man . He was so helpful and incredible . He went above and beyond ! Unfortunately , the bathroom should have been cleaner . Even the soap wasn ' t replaced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] July 4th was a bit crowded but Hilton Chicago worked as a good shelter near the Mill ##eni ##um Park . If you can book a lake view room , it could be one of the best hotel rooms in downtown Chicago . Also , it is quite convenient to access to a variety of Restaurant ##s and snack bars [SEP]
1	[CLS] Father and I got the same name . Book ##ed the hotel at different times . Think they would of figured out who Jr and s ##r is before hand . They saying a Em ##ail was sent to me verify ##ing the rate . Look ##ed at check in with my father . Hard to say much and couldn ’ t remember how much it was . Would think the hotel would look at the hold cc to figure out which rate is which . Room ##s weren ’ t ready . C ##rap ##py feather bed top ##per and pillows . Would avoid at all costs . Was on the phone with the night time manager for a hour to try to straight ##en it . He ’ s saying they done everything correctly . Di ##sa ##g ##ree won ’ t ever come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is very nice and what I would expect of a So ##fit ##el or similar class of hotels . People at the front desk were very welcoming . What really surprised me was the room . It is fine but feels very old . The room is clean but carpet had stain ##s which was very off - putting . The bed ##ding is com ##fy but the bed and other furniture seem old and worn . I booked a king but got a queen . It is only me and for one night for business so it is " fine " . That is all . Feel ##s a lot like a 3 star hotel room . I booked on a travel site and perhaps they provide a different quality of room as a result ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] I like most Kim ##pton Hotels and this was no exception . Historic building that is made into a ch ##ic bout ##ique hotel . The room was small and well equipped . The hotel was in a good location . Was not clear that the restaurant offered room service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel twice for business in the past 8 weeks . The location is great , as is staff , but what I found very odd is that this hotel , unless apparently booked to capacity , does not offer room service whatsoever . You are left with either eating at the steak ##house on the premises , the bar ( if it ' s open and not booked for a private event ) or the third , less expensive restaurant in the lobby ( also potentially booked ) . If , like me , you want to work in your room , you are then at the mercy of G ##ru ##b ##H ##ub or some other delivery service . I find it odd that a hotel that cater ##s to business customers ( and a H ##ya ##tt , for crying out loud ) is so def ##icient in this way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d everything about the hotel , staff , huge rooms , v ##alet , location , and rooftop bar . The room was so spacious and had a beautiful view . The staff was so helpful and kind . We enjoyed drinks and a snack on the rooftop after checking in at noon ! We will return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Old hotel , in good condition . Very updated new bathroom ##s and fur ##nish ##ing . Staff is good not aggressive however on service . Did not eat at the cafe . There on business and out of the hotel all day . Great location , a block off Michigan Avenue , across from the Drake hotel . Step across the street if you need a taxi quickly . They all go to the Drake first for pickup . Only two blocks from the beach on the lake front . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Except ##ional experience from start to finish . Stay ##ed at this property with a free night , earned in their frequent travel ##er program . Check ##ed in an they upgraded us to a full suite , with view of the river . Perfect room . We also used the member ' s club for early evening snack and breakfast . Staff was very friendly and funny . Made us feel at home . Re ##com ##men ##d the em ##pan ##ada ##s for app ##eti ##zer . Best part is we de ##di ##ded to make a reservation for NY ##E at the Living Room , where they made some private suites for viewing the fireworks on the river . Very creative , just captured space on the bridge with perfect view . Our waiter Jimmy was the best . High ##ly recommend this for small group seeking nice venue for NY ##E . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had A f ##abulous time the hotel had such a great location and we had a beautiful suite . Their staff was so lovely and the con ##cier ##ge Alex is price ##less he have the best recommendations which made it all around a perfect trip to Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve traveled to around 16 countries and had a wide game ##te of hotel experiences . I ' m a fan of Art Dec ##o , so the Ambassador really spoke to me . Tri ##sha , at the front desk was eager to share the history of the building and overall provided amazing customer service . I spoke at length with Angel the Manager on duty and he really went out of his way to make us feel at hotel home . He told me he just wants us to be comfortable and those words were met with solid resolve . W ##aw what an amazing experience and top shelf staff ! ! High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is in a pretty good location . We were able to get to the magnificent mile fairly easily . The hotel is clean and our suite was spacious . There is a fitness center and nice indoor pool . It took us some time to get our two c ##ri ##bs delivered to the room but other than that there were no issues . We really appreciated the evening social before going out to dinner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What makes it great service from the front door to the room , food , drinks and special set - ups . Bring you fellow workers , your family they are all welcome to this CH ##IC ##AG ##O Landmark place . En ##joy ##ed my 29th year here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Talbot ##t in May , and all experience at the hotel was great . The location is excellent , near Michigan Avenue , a lot of restaurants and stores . All staff was very kind , it is really a good cost benefit to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hotel Monaco Chicago is on the river in Chicago and is perfectly located for all your adventures ! Beautiful views of the river , the friend ##liest and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff I have ever met and clean ! Don ' t under ##est ##imate the South Water Kitchen that is attached to the hotel , they have some amazing food ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] There is no w ##ow factor here . The staff are not welcoming except for the bell ##men who do a great job . This is definitely not fl ##val ##ue for money with many taxes app ##pie ##d to the published rate . in addition the restaurant situation is ridiculous in that you are compelled to use to ##me service because it ’ s being used by a group . Room service of course comes with a delivery fee and applied g ##rat ##uity even though the f ##ries are over salt ##ed and the wait is more than 30 minutes . The Dec ##or is nice but nothing special , the building itself is striking but a hotel of this named caliber So ##fit ##el should provide far better service and have a proper functioning restaurant open to AL ##L guests for breakfast lunch and dinner as well as room service . Not impressed . Would never stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a wonderful experience at our stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago . I highly recommend staying at this property ! From the moment we checked in the staff was truly amazing and there for our every need . We will definitely be returning ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a week at this great hotel . Great location , close to great restaurants , shopping & sights ##ee ##ing . The staff was great , very friendly . The food was good . Fantastic gym , so many machines and weights . Big bonus , they had 2 P ##elo ##ton bikes ! Great views . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is a good hotel with excellent location and reasonable price . The employee of front desk provide detail explain ##ation to us , and the room is big enough and clean . I will recommend it to my fire ##nds and co - workers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great people from front desk staff to the bell staff , all were pro ##s . The property itself is beautiful . so clean , comfortable with all the amenities you ' d expect in a top notch hotel such as this , including the most comfortable beds . The location is right where you want to be near all the action on MI a ##ve . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Extreme ##ly nice place to stay ! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful . Love the floor to ceiling windows . A couple things . . . our desk in our room had a broken glass piece on it . For the price you pay , I would think that this would have been replaced . The room was very room ##y and had plenty of storage . I suggest maybe a microwave or a place that people could warm up food for those late night c ##ra ##ving ##s with the left ##overs from dinner ! Overall a beautiful place and I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great location if you are staying in Chicago , walking distance to shops , restaurants etc . very safe area and in the heart of the city . loved the hotel and location . Great for business and personal travel . Lots of places to eat , reasonable and what ' s not to like about H ##ya ##tt or Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , service , accommodation , at all great ! I recommend this hotel , for business or vacation because the location was great and the services also . The price of extra services is expensive like SP ##A . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Worst hotel service ever . Stay ##ing here for 4 nights and im not getting any help for a single request . The simple things like adapt ##ors and slip ##pers . A ##pp ##rent ##ly they are all O ##UT . and the staff ##s are very rude ! ! ! Just checked in today and I am already regret ##ting booking this hotel . This hotel is never a 4 star . Forget about bout ##ique whatever names and go for proper 4 star hotel chain . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is close to everything . The room is really small , yet co ##zy . They have free champagne during happy hour . If you fly in and need to store your luggage before or after check - in / check - out they have a room to store it in . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything was first class from the moment I walked in the front door un ##titled the time I left . I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and businesses associates . The front desk was very nice and helpful as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel in the heart of Chicago with exceptional service . Clean ##liness and over the top comfort in room . Great Bar and restaurant and work out room above expectations . Pol ##ite and helpful associates . Lu ##x ##ury and comfort the standard ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went for our anniversary and they went out of their way to make it special after they found out . Especially Stacy , Evelyn , and Rick ( ? ) ( Hope i remembered the names right . ) The companion gold ##fish are a great idea . Get one ! The room was gorgeous with a set ##tee and a sit - in window . Service in all aspects was top - notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel is perfectly located just a few steps off Michigan Avenue . Check in is quick and they have nice guest ##rooms . Internet is free and even good for streaming . The rooms have a safe and a mini ##f ##ridge . When you are lucky ( or ask ) you might have a view over Millennium Park . Across from the hotel is a C ##VS , so you can easily get everything for some basic needs . From the Hotel you can walk a few steps to the north then you reach a canal , a bit to the west you have the landings for many tours around the city by bus or boat as desired . Around Michigan and State St you find all kinds of famous stores an restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The strike will leave you with a messy room , no coffee , limited dining options and a lot of i ##rri ##tating noise . Wait until that ' s over and you ' ll probably be fine . We paid full price for sub ##par surroundings . No re ##com ##pen ##se was offered . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently stayed at the So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and it was a great experience , it is very well located and the hotel and service in general was very good . I think this is a great option for your next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] During initial check in there was an issue with my online booking , but the staff was exceptional . Ke ##enan and Ruth working the front desk fixed it right away . The room was awesome and at a great price . I ' ve stayed at several different hotels in Chicago . My last 2 stays have been at Swiss ##ote ##l and I see my next stay being at Swiss ##ote ##l as well . I love staying here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What you get for the price is a steal of a deal . The decorations are very unique & class ##y so I loved it visually . The staff are very friendly and helpful . They keep the grounds very clean and up to date . The rooms , are small , but that didn ' t bother me as I wasn ' t there to spend time in my room . The bathroom was beautiful and very clean , yet again , small . The walls are thin , so if anyone talks loudly , you can hear them . I loved that the offer compliment ##ary wine every evening , with generous portions . I would go back because location , clean ##liness and staff , it was well worth the price I paid . Thanks for the nice time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was expecting a little more since I have stayed at other and better Intercontinental hotels elsewhere , but nice great view from corner room , nice gym and awesome pool . Best location on Miracle mile ! Nice b ##uff ##et breakfast also . Would return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good size room with comfortable bed and clean bathroom . Room feels a bit dated and a re ##f ##resh but otherwise the stay was perfect . Show ##er pressure was low and it takes a long time for hot water to come on so a lot of water was wasted . Service is excellent . Staff are friendly and I appreciate that they went the extra mile by going out to buy me a humid ##ifier when I requested one ( other hotels would just deny my request ) . Only draw ##back is that location may not be as convenient as other hotels in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] staff for conference were very re ##sp ##ons ##ive and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Hotel staff was mostly re ##sp ##ons ##ive - had one bad experience with con ##cier ##ge who would not help bell man check baggage despite not being busy with customers . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently had the opportunity , to stay at the Fair ##mont Hotel in Chicago , while on a four day business trip . During check - in , there was a slight issue related to my travel agent . The front desk staff was beyond helpful , court ##eous , and knowledge ##able to my p ##light . H ##yo ( the front desk girl ) made me feel at ease , during my mini crisis . The location is awesome . The view from my room is stunning . The bell ##man & house ##keeping staff were friendly ! ! I truly enjoy this hotel and will probably stay here on my next business trip in a few months . The photo is a view from my room ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was perfect . This is the first time in years I have been perfectly satisfied with the entire stay including the Room , staff , location , room service , and clean ##liness . There is nothing I would have changed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here recently for a conference , we had about 75 to 80 people in our group . We all stayed in the hotel Monaco by Kim ##pton . I ' d say overall it was a good stay , the conference rooms were big and the rooms were decent not spectacular though . The food for the catering was average at best . I ' d say it ' s a business travel ##er type hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at Hotel Monaco 3 / 26 - 3 / 28 with our family of 4 . While we live in the Chicago suburbs it was a great location and base to explore the city . High ##lights that made this hotel a unique experience is their special treatment of the kids . Upon arrival they were given cute welcome bags with some toys and crafts . They even brought a gold ##fish to our room for the duration of our stay . However , my favorite part about this hotel was the window seats . A great use of space in the room , and a really enjoyable place to read or just look out . Service was kind and helpful . I really cannot think of anything negative to say about this hotel and would glad ##ly stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly service with a French fl ##air . Con ##ven ##ient location for shopping , restaurants and other attractions . Front desk , room service and house ##keeping staff were all outstanding . The rooms are a little dated but the bathroom ##s are great : spacious and well - equipped , with separate shower . Worth it for the past ##ry basket breakfast alone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was the best part . You are close to incredible restaurants , a subway and you can find affordable parking around the corner ( do not park here it is insane ##ly expensive ) . The hotel itself is beautiful and the room is comfortable . My only suggestion for the hotel is to put coffee makers in the room . Great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I found this hotel through St ##ash Hotel Re ##ward ##s - and I ' m so glad ! The location was fantastic - just steps from the River Walk , shopping , and dining . The rooms were well - appointed and really quiet . I was most impressed with the service . They have a cool text - con ##cier ##ge service that you can text with the front desk throughout your stay . I was suspicious that it would be g ##im ##mic ##ky , but it was really helpful . We were out at a restaurant and wanted to find a good comedy club , so we texted Martin at the front desk and he sent us to a cool " underground " venue . Overall , everyone at the hotel was very warm , persona ##ble and at ##ten ##tive ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was OK - it felt a bit tired and pretty cavern ##ous . We were in a strangely shaped room that felt pretty small ( not a lake view ) . I have to say it was not as good as the Fair ##mont San Francisco - now there is a class ##y old hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Suite was rather small . Three sisters together was a tight fit . Bed ##s were comfortable . I didn ' t realize the corner windows would be in the bedroom . The room is not organized in a way that allows you to enjoy the view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel seemed great . Right off Michigan Ave , the room itself was nice , staff seemed friendly . Then 7 ##am rolled around and we were awoke ##n to the L ##O ##U ##D sounds of people chanting and banging drums . Come to find out they were employees demanding a fair contract . Politics aside - - a hotel cannot let that happen . We went from having a nice stay to having a completely miserable experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every aspect of our stay exceeded our expectations . Great staff ! Most comfortable beds ever . Amazing location . Bar makes amazing ma ##rt ##ini ' s and the restaurant makes a lovely breakfast . Would highly recommend for couples mixing work and pleasure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Return visit to The Monaco this time with friends . Very well - located and maintained , friendly and ( mostly ) helpful staff . . . special prop ##s to Paul at breakfast in S ##W Kitchen and , David at Con ##cier ##ge / F ##D . . . outstanding service from wonderful people ! We ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is always clean . Staff are welcoming and friendly . Miss the pool . Palm restaurant was very good for a hotel restaurant in a city with the best steak houses in the country . Location on Ma ##g mile is perfect for me . Wish I understood their loyalty program better but that is on me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room and bathroom were f ##abulous . Stay ##ed in the hotel and had meeting in a conference room . Hotel catering the food . I was very disappointed by the lack of understanding or service recovery for exposure to food I am highly all ##ergic too . The staff were alerted before my arrival of all ##er ##gy the and thought it was not a big deal . . . . sort of is my life on the line ! Staff in the restaurant / bar area were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was nice , but front desk staff awful . They told me several times bell ##men were " on way " but never showed . No a ##pologies - I was hung up on 3 times in 3 days by front desk . Other hotels better value [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel with great amenities , service and comfort ! From checking in to the great accommodation ##s , awesome drinks in the bar to great food and did I mention great location ! High ##ly recommended and will stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visited Chicago for business and stayed three nights at The Talbot ##t . The room was co ##sy , clean and I slept very well . Excellent location ; there are nice restaurants and shopping shops around there . The staff was also kind and nice ; especially , Cody helped me a lot since check - in . I was able to be back to my country with nice experience at the Talbot ##t . : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad does not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Well appointed , large rooms for the city and service that is fantastic . Love an ups ##cale hotel with friendly and professional service and can ' t recall an instance in which I felt so welcome and appreciated when checking into a hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for a night before travelling to Detroit . The room was really spacious and the view from the room wasn ' t bad either ( I think overall , the location of the hotel is its biggest US ##P ) . But the rooms were too dim ##ly lit for my liking . But that ' s just my personal opinion . The restaurants were also very good . Their morning breakfast spread is one of the best and largest that I have seen . Their staff was also very court ##eous and I liked how they took care of all our needs at all times . And last ##ly , the historic value that this property carries with itself was a bit overwhelming . It was a privilege to have stayed at such a historic property . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was an un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble moment , I went with my husband and let me tell you we did not turn on the TV the entire time we were there is was the best ! We will definitely book at this location again ! ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My room was just gorgeous . With 2 walls of windows overlooking the Chicago timeline , it couldn ' t have been more perfect . The bathroom was spacious , my bed was comfortable and everything I needed was right in my room waiting for me . The service and food throughout was top notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a few nights and found the location to be great . Walking distance to shopping and a safe area . We found the night ##life lacking in this area , though . Room was shared between 4 people . 2 double beds and a separate living area made the small bedroom a plus . Room was clean , although lacking in toilet ##ries which we were able to track down with guest services . Front desk staff and con ##cier ##ge were helpful and court ##eous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel may have the friend ##liest staff I ' ve ever seen . I was greeting by the front desk and bell desk anytime I came in or left the building . I was texted after arrival to see how my stay was going . I gave the hotel a 4 rating and was asked what they needed to do to receive a 5 . I joking ##ly said to have a ve ##nding machine so I could buy some Diet Coke ( F ##Y ##I - there is a 7 - 11 right around the corner if you want to stock up ) . They proceeded to send Diet P ##ep ##si to my room - awesome service ! Text ##ing was great when I had a question about a bar I had heard about . Room was clean and very comfortable ; location great ; continental breakfast & happy hour were good too . I ' d definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel sits on the Red Line of the CT ##A . Buy a 3 day pass and get anywhere . Absolutely beautiful lobby . Very elegant entrances . G ##rac ##ious old hotel re ##vi ##tal ##ized . Bath ##room was pretty small but everything else was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was excellent , right next to Eat ##aly . Lots of great restaurants and shopping in walking distance . Staff were friendly . Complete hot breakfast and an evening meal with beer and wine are provided . Full kitchen and large room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Conrad Chicago exceeded my expectations over the course of my recent 3 day / 2 night stay . Outstanding service at check - in and check - out , friendly staff throughout the hotel , an im ##ma ##culate room and one of the best breakfast ##s I ' ve had in a long time . My wife and I have already started planning our next stay . What a treat , thank you CC ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is a great s ##ty ##lish hotel for those wanting to avoid the chain experience . Room ##s were very comfortable and staff very helpful if not overwhelmed at times . Free happy hour has a nice selection of beer and wines . The breakfast is minimal . Ski ##p the day old tasting past ##ries and grab a f ##abulous don ##ut from Fire ##c ##racker just around the corner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Kim ##pton All ##egro is a delight : central ##ly located on Randolph Street , staffed with the most helpful desk clerk ##s and baggage staff ( Shi ##khar ) , great rooms that are ( mostly ) quiet , and excellent food at 321 . Here ' s what you want with the Front Des ##k at any hotel : S ##OL ##UT ##ION ##S ! On Friday night , the hotel was full - - big wedding the next day . Our lovely quiet room on Thursday turned into the sound of Day Care on Friday night when a new family moved in next door . No Problem for the All ##egro ' s Front Des ##k : moved us to a wonderful room , floors away , quiet as a tomb . We were so happy . And Shi ##khar moved our stuff so we had absolutely no worries . What a delight ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Me and my husband stayed there for 2 days . The bed was very com ##fy , the room was super ##cle ##an , You can adjust the A / C . They offer coffee and hot chocolate in the mornings and the hotel lobby is beautiful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall everything was fine . The room was comfortable . Nothing outstanding , but good . I stayed at the hotel as it was the site for the conference I attended . The banquet food had decent options . The staff was friendly and pro ##mpt in cleaning up after meals to allow the rooms to be used for the sessions . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It is always a pleasure to stay at the O ##m ##ni . They have beautiful rooms and the staff is always friendly and helpful . Great restaurant and bar too ! It has a small town feel to it even though it is a luxury hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el is a beautiful hotel in a great neighborhood . Our room was modern and comfortable . We had a suite which me ##ad a nice size . There were slip ##pers and robes which was a nice touch . The hotel is very clean . The front desk staff were very friendly . The location is excellent . Lots of restaurants and shopping close by . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff were excellent and very welcoming . They gave excellent advise on rests ##ura ##nts . The location is close to everything we wanted to see . We would definitely recommend and will return next time we go to Chicago [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every year a group of my friends and I fly to Chicago for a Friday on the town and a Saturday j ##aunt to Notre Dame for a football game . I really appreciate smaller more intimate hotels and The Talbot ##t is my absolute favorite . The rooms are excellent and the services are wonderful with friendly and efficient employees . Great Hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I wanted to love this hotel based on all the glowing reviews . Unfortunately , I found it very noisy between every taxi driver / car bee ##ping till the we ##e hours or the sounds of the city . Hotel has only 6 floors so you are constantly reminded where you are , and I live in Manhattan . Evening reception is a nice idea , just get there early or the cheese cube ##s run out and are not replaced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at this hotel ! Love the interior and plus ##h beds , bath ##robe ##s and slip ##pers . The shades opened and closed with the push of a button on either side of the bed , and the view was lovely from the 18th floor . I enjoyed coffee from the in - room N ##es ##press ##o machine while getting ready in the morning . Can ##not say enough good things about the Conrad Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I rented a suite for a 4 day meeting and everything was beyond wonderful . The suite was clean and spacious and well appointed ( maybe the couch could be up - dated ) . No request was too big or too small . Everything we asked for appeared within minutes . . . and everyone was so da ##rn nice ! ! And , of course , the location can ' t be beat . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every time I am at Hotel All ##egro , David and Paige are the warm ##est people that always greet me first . Whenever I am visiting or passing through to do work in the beautiful lobby , I have another good experience . High ##ly recommend for anyone staying in the Downtown Loop area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall we liked our room . It had a good view of Grant park . We booked 2 queen beds with 2 bathroom ##s . The beds were a ta ##d small for queen ##s , but we made it work . The room was clean and well stock ##ed . My husband enjoyed use of the gym facilities . There a few things I did not like . The up ##cha ##rge for everything ! $ 15 / day for use of the gym , a charge for late check out , and the worst . . . . . $ 3 / bag to hold our luggage after we checked out . What ? ? ? I have never been charged to hold luggage . And you had to pay in cash ? ! This put a sour note to the end of our vacation ! I don ' t know that we would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff and hotel were great from check in to check out . We will return to this Hilton again . Location was great , room was good size and updated and clean . Staff was very helpful guiding us around town . Next time we will stay longer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was great , close to Michigan Ave as well as the lake . The lobby was huge . Check - in was a bit slow because of a line but the reception ##ist was very friendly and helped resolved a booking issue that was completely my fault . The rooms are a little dated , especially the bathroom ##s . The river view was nice but not amazing ##ly scenic . Overall , the bed was very comfortable and rooms were quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] O ##m ##ni is a great hotel with a very ideal location . Love the surrounding area and the staff and rooms are everything you could want . The hotel offers great food , drink , and atmosphere along with a very clean and comfortable room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent service , front desk had a friendly crew who had us checked within minutes . Beautiful , elegant room , very comfortable bed and extremely clean . Great location will definitely come back for a longer stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel many times in the past and while the hotel itself is just average , the location certainly is not . Right off Michigan Avenue , this place is so convenient that you over ##look the d ##é ##cor which is a bit tired . My room however was very functional and updated . The price was good for this part of town and the staff was extremely nice . The little bar was always very busy . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel lobby has a cool , bout ##ique v ##ibe . Room ##s are clean but standard rooms and bathroom ##s are small . Reason ##ably priced relative to other hotels in area . Location is good to explore the city by foot for personal or business trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose the Fair ##mont because it was close to most of the tourist attractions and the hotel is definitely well located . Not far from the parks , the river cruise , the art Institute and the lake . The room was big and clean . The view from our room was nice as we could see the Buckingham Fountain . The service was ok but nothing out of the extraordinary and we had a small problem with the fire alarm during our stay . Nothing special or dangerous but a little bit annoying . So overall a good stay that met our expectations but not exceeded them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed the Conrad . It is quite price ##y , but you do receive top notch amenities . Re ##ceived a corner King room upgrade as I was a H Honors member . Room ##s are spacious , with beautiful large bathroom ##s , tons of closet space , and nice views . Very re ##sp ##ons ##ive staff and clean facilities - hope to try one of the restaurants in the future ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed at the hotel for a conference , the room was clean and quiet . Staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The hotel does show its age from time to time , but for us didn ' t distract at all . The staff at the front desk and lobby were very helpful . Room was a bit dated - bathroom was updated not long ago . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one night in a king suite with my husband . Bed was not comfortable and the sheet kept coming off the mattress . The bathroom was well decorated and the w ##hir ##l ##pool tub was what made the trip romantic and relaxing . The mini bar prices were over ##p ##rice ##d but that ’ s no surprise . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary champagne at night and coffee or tea in the morning . Vale ##t employees were very helpful in directing us to the nearest convenience store and back to our parking structure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Service , location and overall quality of standards Male this hotel the best choice for a stay for sights ##ee ##ing , shopping and dining in Chicago whether you stay only for one or for all of the there options [SEP]
0	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt Chicago is an old hotel . that said , what they might not have in amenities they make up for with excellent customer service . Whether in the hotel restaurants , meeting rooms , or the Big Bar - attention to the customer is always a priority . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great property with nice rooms . Executive lounge is very nice . I did have a minor problem with the heating / AC in my room and it wasn ' t resolved properly the first time . I spoke with Mercedes at the front desk , and she was an absolute star ! Mercedes went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied , and she is a true asset to this property and to SP ##G ! I stay in hotels about 250 nights per year . I seldom have issues or problems , but when I do I sure wish every property had an employee as friendly , dedicated , and professional as Mercedes ! Thank you Chicago She ##rato ##n - a great property with employees like Mercedes who really care about the customer experience ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very sat ##is ##fic ##ed . Not many at the hotel . Restaurant ##s and bars were closed . Sad but understand ##able . The parking is a problem since it is extremely expensive near Michigan Ave . Rate ##s between $ 40 . 00 and $ 55 . 00 for a 24 hours term is next to outrage ##ous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ent hotel but how you don ’ t have bottle ##d water for purchase in your lobby is extremely annoying and in ##con ##ven ##ient . This is my 2nd visit ( only hotel in Chicago my company allows us to stay at ) and I come back to the hotel late at night every evening and nothing is open in the vicinity . I can either : bring a glass or two of water up to my room from the lobby which is difficult with bags , squeeze my way into the bar and purchase one for $ 4 or purchase one in room for $ 6 for which our company audit ##s us . Please offer water bottle ##d water in your lobby to grab and go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very nice with a good location so if you are looking to go to Chicago it ' s a good recommendation . Staff were very helpful in specific W ##ah ##ei ##d He ##lm ##y I would take his recommendations for food places and sights , this guy knows what he ' s talking about . The only down ##side of the hotel was they had no business center and it was a business trip and i had to pay 20 + $ just to print and scan a couple of pages . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed one night at the She ##rato ##n Grand in Chicago and had a wonderful experience . The staff were friendly and helpful . This is a beautiful hotel with many amenities and in a great location . We appreciated the clean ##liness of the rooms too . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was with Home ##wood Suite ##s this past week and the v ##alet group went above and beyond . Amir went to pick up my rental car and noticed a flat tire . I needed to get to the airport quickly to make my flight . Amir not only pumped up my tire , but then drove it to a local shop and had it repaired . Amir didn ' t ask for a Penny just quickly loaded my bags and got me out so I could make my flight . This is the type of service you don ' t see anymore . Thank you Amir and thank you Home ##wood Suite ##s CH ##ica ##go Grand for finding such good people . I won ' t stay anywhere else on in the Ma ##g Mile area . Thank you ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Up ##sca ##le hotel with perfect combination of modern features and spacious rooms . Love ##d the space and the layout of the room . Location is very good for Michigan Ave . , Rush Street Din ##ning and walks to Navy Pier and Oak Street Beach . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hilton gets 5 stars across the board . Check - in was fast and welcoming ( thanks , Matt ! ) The bell hop was efficient and cheerful . The location couldn ' t be beat . The lake ##view ( from the suite ) was even better than you would expect . The hotel and my room was spot ##less . Breakfast was truly spectacular . There were three tables and the o ##mel ##ette station was the best I ' ve seen ( even comparing to other 5 star chains in Hawaii and Europe ) . The lobby was lovely and the bar / g ##rill inviting . There ' s nothing to second guess here . Perfect stay . S ##UI ##TE : Lake ##view on 9th floor is worth the s ##p ##lu ##rge ! Suite was sweet with 3 t ##v ' s , 2 mini ##f ##ridge ##s , 2 bathroom ##s , m ##ur ##phy bed , two club chairs , wet ##bar , dining room table , l - shaped sofa and coffee table , two desk ##s , two entries . . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is less than a year old and is gorgeous with luxurious rooms and amenities however the staff is in ##ept and in ##ef ##ficient . Our room was not ready until 5 pm when it was supposed to be ready at 3 pm . Front desk staff was un ##friend ##ly and seemed confused about hotel procedures and policies . Breakfast is over ##p ##rice ##d and they ran out of items on the b ##uff ##et that were advertised . How can you be out of bacon and plain bag ##els at 9 am ? ? They did not have enough staff to pour coffee in a time ##ly manner . There were no plates available on the b ##uff ##et . You had to wait for a server to bring them to you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very fast check in and check out . W ##i - fi connection is great and in room facilities are superb . My room had a Star ##bu ##cks coffee maker , took a while to understand how to use it , but once I figured that out it was ni ##rva ##na in a cup . Staff is court ##eous and helpful . I need a hot water k ##ett ##le and that was arranged for me in 5 minutes flat . I was truly impressed . My room was on the 39th floor and had the view of Chicago river - splendid ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our hotel check in and check out were easy , staff are helpful and pleasant . House ##keeping services were superior . Our room had a great view . The room was comfortable and clean . The king size bed was very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are large and plus ##h with comfortable linen ##s . Staff is very at ##ten ##tive . A great location for downtown Chicago just steps away from restaurants , attractions and the magnificent mile of shops . We have stayed here before and we ' re very pleased with their service , price and location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has gone down in quality since I first started bringing groups from the UK in 2010 . No executive lounge , A charge ##able gym and bedrooms that seriously need re ##nova ##ting to bring up to the 21st century , However the 3 reasons I keep returning are as follow David and Lucy who work in the Breakfast restaurant and Alicia who works on reception . These 3 people are without doubt the friend ##liest , polite ##st and most approach ##able people I have had the pleasure to meet , they make what is a very average experience in a “ Bed factory ” turn into a pleasure whenever I see them , they have smiles and attitudes that can make any “ a ##v ##g ” stay a real pleasure . Thank you Alicia , David and Lucy [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t is a small bout ##ique hotel in the center of the Gold Coast ( close to many exquisite food options ) . I most enjoyed the intimate feel and the friendly staff . The compliment ##ary drink helped facilitate a nice social v ##ibe and made it a very welcoming space for a single travel ##er like myself . [SEP]
0	[CLS] De ##fin ##ite ##ly not going back Clean t ##idy but not cost effective . Never tell you everything . You have to figure it out . De ##fin ##ite ##ly , not to be visited in winter , wind ##y ; really wind ##y as compared with other hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel friend staff perfect location . Been here for both business and pleasure I look forward to coming back again . View ##s over the river and lake are amazing . Super fun staff in the Regency Club . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful location , beautiful hotel , professional staff , luxurious rooms , bathroom & bed ##ding . The in - room coffee is a ne ##sp ##ress ##o machine with a wonderful array of options a a ##cco ##ut ##rem ##ents . So nice to wake up to excellent coffee in the room . Can ’ t wait to visit again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel exceeded all our expectations . Very friendly staff , clean room , nice bed and bathroom . Central location . On ground floor they asked for our name , at lobby on 19th floor everything was ready for us , nice experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here a couple of times for a conference and I have to say this hotel is amazing ! Room ##s are very clean , service is great and there is always a great view of the city in any room . Location makes it very close to the Loop , Navy Pier and most tourist ##y locations . This is definitely the place to go if you ' re in Chi - Town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing property with top - notch , market leading guest ##rooms . Bath ##rooms were spot ##less with space , bed was beyond comfortable , and am ##men ##ities were superb . Would recommend to any non - price conscious friend / family / colleague looking for a luxury experience on a great corner of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The entire team at The Talbot ##t Hotel transformed our stay from good to G ##RE ##AT ! From the recently updated f ##ac ##ili ##tes , to the bar & restaurant , to the overall attention to detail and customer - oriented demeanor of E ##VE ##R ##Y staff member , The Talbot ##t will be our # 1 choice for lo ##dging when visiting Chicago for many years to come ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very nice & great experience By far one of the nice ##st hotels I ’ ve ever stayed at , on top of making my first time & experience in Chicago a bit easier . I definitely want to come back sometime soon to both the hotel & city [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked 2 nights at the hotel , when we came in the room was not ready so we were given compliment ##ary cocktail ##s while we waited ( less than 15 minutes until the room was ready ) . The room itself is kinda s ##ty ##lish and very big , the bathroom though needs some renovation . The hotel is located near the center so everything is in a walking distance . We enjoyed our time there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our most recent Chicago trip included a trip by train from Springfield , Illinois to Chicago . We arrived in Chicago about 10 : 30 and acquired a cab to the hotel . Check - in was not until 3 : 00 , but we decided to see if we could check - in to get rid of our luggage . They checked us in and our weekend was amazing from there on . We were so grateful and everything went smoothly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice location . Pretty much close to anything you might want to see . Hotel has free good breakfast and dinner cocktail with soup and salad . Overall it is good . It would have been very good if the Valley people are a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went on a long weekend to do a memory - lane walk ( we are both from Chicago and haven ' t been back together ) . The staff was wonderful and the interior was restored but yet kept its feel for the past . I do wish they had room service for coffee and breakfast ! Other than that , I enjoyed staying right in the heart of downtown and in a hotel that has a great feel for the past . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We made a quick trip to Chicago in January , and we ' re reminded W ##H ##Y Chicago is known as the Wind ##y City , and also known for its winters . The staff at the Monaco kept us warm with their hospitality and helpful ##ness , however , and we enjoyed our stay very much . Close walks to museums , restaurants , and the lake ##front made the hotel a perfect place for our stay , and it was even convenient to the train to get to the airport . And the wine ##bar happy hour each night was a fun way to relax after / before being out . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We found a special deal to spend some nights at the hotel at a very reasonable price , the room was comfortable , the bathroom luxurious , the staff very kind . The hotel is very close to the centre so we could visit the city by feet . The entrance hall is very beautiful and there is also an as ##ton ##ishing ballroom that can be used for conferences and various events . We were just a little disappointed to find out the price for the internet connection , about ten dollars : in my opinion it ’ s ill ##ogical to ask a fee for the w ##i - fi in a luxury hotel , especially nowadays that ' s free almost everywhere . Apart from this , we had a very good stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent two nights ( Fr ##i / Sa ##t ) at the Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro while seeing 2 shows in Chicago . Access from O ' Hare to the hotel by train was easy , The hotel let us check in early and the room was very nice . They have a 5 ##pm ch ##amp ##ai ##gn happy hour that we attended both nice and ended up meeting and having great conversations with other guests . The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with recommendations , especially when it rain ##ed all day on Saturday and we had already been to the usual museums on previous trips . The only negative was the slow elevators with only 2 of the 3 being operational . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice location 2 minutes away from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Hancock building and Navy Pier is close by . We walked to all attractions without using public transportation . Room is good size with large marble bathroom ( there are separate shower and bath ##tub ) . Additional bonus is a great restaurant with perfect French food . We were so impressed on the first evening that without hesitation went there on our second evening too ! And we weren ' t disappointed ! I recommend this hotel to everyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Each member of the staff I encountered provided exceptional hospitality , from the welcome I received at the front desk , the at ##ten ##tive restaurant service , the enthusiastic door ##man , the pleasant wine hostess , z ##ip ##ping out at check ##out even with some incident ##als , and even a follow up from the manager . Great location , comfortable room , but it was the service that set this trip apart . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed here on our first trip to Chicago . It is in a very good location and made it easy to get wherever we wanted to go . The staff was very helpful and at ##ten ##tive . They had all the amenities we needed and an awesome evening Pro ##se ##cco and c ##ider hour each evening . We would definitely recommend the all ##egro to others ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed at this hotel many , many times . The location is perfect , the staff is incredibly friendly , and the value for the rooms are great . Clean , warm , and nicely appointed . Do your self a favor and be sure to book the executive suite in the tower . The views are incredible , and it is literally , in my opinion , one of the best values offered on the mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Issues : Our " room with a view " wasn ' t . Move ##d us , but didn ' t have a good one that night , so had to un ##pack / pack twice . No use ##able fridge in room ( just over ##p ##rice ##d honor bar ) so couldn ' t store me ##ds or food . And wanted 50 bucks to get one ! Had to ice down everything . And don ' t order a ca ##es ##ar salad at the bar . I ordered with no c ##rout ##ons . . . and got a $ 14 bowl of let ##tu ##ce with some weird vine ##gar - based dressing . B ##lea ##h ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon arriving to All ##egro hotel we were great ##ed by the cu ##rt ##ious and g ##rac ##ious Paige J . She demonstrated ex ##em ##pler ##y customer service and attention to detail . Paige made our stay that much better by finding a room that was more suitable to our needs as a new ##ley wed couple . Thank you Paige and thank you All ##egro for making our trip such a memorable one ! - F ##P [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would say this was the best hotel I ’ ve ever stayed in . Room ##s were great size for family , superb ##ly laid out with all the m ##od con ##s . Perfect ##ly located for restaurants , and adjacent to the ‘ magnificent mile ’ for shopping and exploring . Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice exercise space . No pool or hot tub . Beautiful room . Excellent bed and shower . Great technology in the room with lots of automation - on windows , privacy , and other services . Includes refrigerator and bottle ##d water . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hub ##by and I stayed here Feb 16 to the 18 . Can I just say that the Talbot ##t Hotel has one of the best all around staff ##s . They ' re super friendly , alert , and do their jobs very well . They know about the city , and have no problem giving you suggestions about different things , I loved that . Our room was very nice , loved the shower and bath ##tub . The only things I didn ' t like about the hotel were no I ' ve machines on the floors , so sometimes it was a long wait on ice , and the smart TV in our room never really worked very well . Other than those small problems , that really didn ' t take away from the stay , it was a pretty great hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Palmer House was a ma ##rve ##lous experience . The atmosphere was from another era , grand and luxurious . The staff was at ##ten ##tive and the room splendid . I would have liked to of had a small refrigerator available but the is a minor suggestion . Overall we loved our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything you need is at the hotel , so you really could choose not to leave and still eat and drink at different places every night . The rooms were very nice , and the beds so comfortable . I only wish there was a little more lighting where the full - length mirror was positioned . The hotel is central ##ly located , so we were able to walk everywhere . The only time we called an U ##ber was to go to Old ##e Town and to O ' Hare . It was fantastic . Great service , and they have a little 24 - h ##r . market where you can buy late night snack ##s , coffee , drinks , whatever . We loved it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So many s ##cam ##s , breakfast is free but hot dishes need $ 8 extra . The problem is that they didn ' t tell us in advance . Furthermore , things in the mini ##bar are already over ##charged but don ' t just look at the item price itself , please read carefully , there is also a 20 % convenience fee for the item , which I don ' t understand why they don ' t just include it in the item price in the first place ! ! ! They try their B ##ES ##T to fool you ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you like que ##uing for everything stay at this 1600 room mon ##oli ##th ! Check in , breakfast , elevators , check out - que ##ue que ##ue que ##ue ! The room was fine as was the overall stay but this is a machine of a hotel . Found the b ##urger bar which also has a bar and this was much less crowded so was happy about that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always look f ##owa ##rd to staying at the Palmer House ! Years ago , we came as couples over New Years Eve . Now , just the ladies come for a little time for catching up . The staff works real hard to get us adjoining rooms . The rooms are very spacious . The location is a convenient walk from the train station at Mill ##in ##um Park . This hotel with the famous people de ##cor ##ating the walls , makes you feel as though you stepped back in time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was friendly , from the man at the curb , the front desk and even the maid ##s . The view from our room was gorgeous and many rooms face the river ##front . The room was im ##ma ##culate . The location is great for walking a number of places and convenient to major roads . Didn ' t try the restaurant as it was closed . Also didn ' t stay at the bar ( no one was there ) and didn ' t even go look at the pool . Overall a great stay and we will be back so long as we can get the price on price ##line ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Mr . John ( Vale ##t / Door ##man ) is outstanding ! He is an extra ##ord ##ina ##rily friendly gentleman . He engaged my 17 / 18 year old children each and every time he saw us . . . ask how he could help us every day as we entered or exited the hotel ! ! What a great front porch you have with Mr . John standing to greet folks ! Suzanne at check in very helpful too . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The ambassador hotel is a beautiful and elegant hotel in Chicago . We were w ##owed by the service . Ms . Kay checked us in , it was sea ##m ##less and professional . We let her know we just got married and she was so excited for us . In her power she was able to send us a ch ##ar ##cute ##rie plate with a con ##gratulations card , wishing us a beautiful marriage . Overall would recommend 10 / 10 thank you Kay , Is ##hm ##ael the door ##man and Jose the Se ##cu ##irt ##y man , for your help throughout our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location , just off Michigan Avenue . We booked a Pre ##st ##ige Suite and requested a high floor . It had great views & offered plenty of room for our family of 4 . It was clean , modern and a wonderful location at a fraction of the price of the other 5 star properties nearby . If you want Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile adjacent for a great value , book here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice rooms . Better to stay in the lower levels to avoid long elevator waits . It was a bit in ##con ##ven ##ient to travel off site to use the gym and it was hard to find , and the opening times were not late enough . But once you found it , it was a beautiful facility . Room ##s had great views and beautiful bathroom ##s . Great to explore the downtown of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I hated the hotel , never stay there again . Hotel dirty , un ##friend ##ly staff , elevator broke . The service for the price was bad . I would rather stay at a motel 6 where they leave the light on . Need to do better [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family enjoyed two nights over the Thanksgiving holiday at the historic Palma ##r House and loved our time there . The hotel staff were court ##eous and helpful . The location could not be better . The parade came right past the hotel in fact we could see it from our room . We were an easy walk to the Christmas Market , Macy ’ s and the ice rink near Grant Park . The hotel lobby is truly beautiful with vaulted decorative ceilings and ch ##and ##elier ##s . It seemed to be a popular gathering space for guests with a nice bar and restaurant located there . The rooms were spacious and clean . I would definitely stay there again when in Chicago . By the way , Hamilton is one block away ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price , the views out the window was great for seeing the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le along a busy business street . The room was large and clean . The staff was friendly and helpful . There was a compliment ##ary luggage check - in for you to leave your luggage in case you arrive before your room is ready . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Move ##d to this hotel from w city center due to our extreme di ##sa ##pp ##oint with the quality of the physical accommodation ##s at the W . So glad we moved ! Clean , spacious rooms , and service has been excellent . Would definitely stay again & recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] had one of the B ##ES ##T hotel check - ins I ’ ve ever experienced and I travel a lot ! Today myself and a few girlfriend ##s checked into the Palmer house Hilton . There was s little wait at the honors desk , but the frustration with that was soon forgotten about with the ex ##em ##p ##lary service we received from Dal ##isa Holmes . She was so patient , helpful , professional , sweet , funny and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I know we expect the guest check - in staff to provide of what Dal ##isa did today , but it happens so in ##f ##re ##quent ##ly . Dal ##isa , you obviously love what you do ! So re ##f ##reshing ! Palmer house , you are lucky to have such a delight greeting your customers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at the new Conrad Hotel on Rush and Erie . The lobby is located on the top floor of the hotel ( 20th floor ) . Check in went smooth with an up ##grad ( gold member ) and $ 40 credit toward breakfast . Our room was a large king with a huge bathroom . We judge most hotels if they include bath ##robe ##s and they had very del ##uxe ones in the room . The con ##cier ##ge and all staff were excellent and helpful . This hotel is on par with the R ##itz Carlton or Four Seasons but a better value ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price one pays for this hotel , the value was definitely not there . Had to switch rooms , due to bugs . The next room given had p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper and markings all over the room but by that point had no time to change the 2nd room due to length of line and time it took to talk to the front reception to change the 1st room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just left the ambassador on 2 / 8 / 19 . Nice stay , great location . However , bell staff didn ##t even try assist in helping my wife and daughter carry their cases down the 5 steps although standing there saying goodbye ! ! ! ! . I even tipped the guy 30 min ##s previously for re ##tri ##ev ##ing bags from hold room . shame ##ful ! ! ! What ##s the tip ##ping about , its to much for no service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose this mostly because it was a lot cheaper than others nearby but still looked nice ! It ' s a great hotel , the location is perfect , right by the Hancock Tower . This was my second visit to Chicago and this hotel was very near where I stayed before . The hotel itself had character and was nicely decorated and the rooms were clean , comfortable and spacious . I recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great four day weekend at the Hilton . Great staff and super clean hotel . Perfect location to go out and see the sites around the downtown area and not a bad walk to the river to explore . The only downfall is that the health club charges to use it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was born and raised in Chicago , but do not get to go home often . In Dec 2016 my husband & I went home for a visit & a Bears game . We stayed @ Home ##wood Suite ##s Downtown & loved it . It ' s a clean , beautiful , well kept hotel with amazing staff who treat you like old friends . I highly recommend this hotel for your vacation . The location is fantastic as well ; close to everything you will need . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for 4 nights in September . The hotel location was perfect . 5 min from Michigan Ave . 10 - 15 ##min to Navy Pier . 30 ##min to Willis tower . Everything is in walking Distance . I stayed in a standard room with 2 double beds . The room was perfect . Dec ##ent size , nice Bath ##room , good closet space . The hotel is right on the river which on a nice day is lovely to sit outside . Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel which comes in handy in the morning . Dec ##ent bar as well . The gym was okay . Dec ##ent size with plenty of Card ##io equipment . Some free weights & machines . Dec ##ent size swimming pool as well . Would definitely stay here again and would recommend anyone visiting Chicago to do likewise . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wanted a luxurious family stay ##cation in Chicago . Conrad Hilton is a super choice . It ' s extremely private . Feel ##s like you ' re going to a high end studio apartment off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Very secure as you must have a key card to access your floor . I ##mp ##ress ##ive 2 story lobby area on the 19th and 20th floors . Super roof top deck . Very impressive health ##c ##lub . Guest rooms are well appointed with very soft linen ##s , a NE ##SP ##RE ##SS ##O coffee maker and refrigerator , oversized bathroom and wonderful electronics to control lighting and the shades . Rich , contemporary de ##cor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No s ##ham ##po ##o in bathroom Slow staff during check in G ##ym not included , + $ 15 per day Room service doesn ’ t knock before entering room De ##fin ##ite ##ly would recommend looking elsewhere . It met basic needs like having a place to actually sleep [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I loved this hotel ! The service was excellent and we loved the outside cafe . Every staff member was friendly and helpful and always had a smile . Our room was clean and comfortable . We pay ##ed extra for v ##alet parking and then left our car for the weekend and walked everywhere . Chicago is a very vibrant city and we loved being a part of it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful locations and views of you are willing to pay for them . Room condition could have been better including a more thorough cleaning . It was the marathon weekend so hotel was busy but should have been able to accommodate a house ##keeping request in less than an hour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every time we stay at the So ##fit ##el in Chicago , we are greeted with warm and helpful personnel . The lobby is large and elegant . The rooms are clean and somewhat spacious with huge bathroom ##s as well . The amenities and location are another reason we stay at the So ##fit ##el whenever we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal for our first trip to Chicago . The hotel is in walking distance of most of Chicago ’ s tourist and non tourist destinations . The rooms are spacious , clean and very comfortable . The staff are extremely at ##ten ##tive . The bars and restaurant are top notch . De ##fin ##ite ##ly our go to hotel next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location to walk to all the local attractions . Walking distance to magnificent mile , state street , river ##front , lake ##front , millennium park , restaurants and theatres . services was great and the atmosphere was amazing [SEP]
0	[CLS] really enjoyed my stay at Chicago H ##ya ##tt Regency , had a little issue , but still was not de ##ter ##red . wish my trip was longer , clean room great location walking distance . to restaurants and shopping areas . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My experience at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago was amazing . The rooms were very C ##LE ##AN and CO ##MF ##OR ##TA ##BL ##E , and the VI ##E ##W from my room window was breath taking . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to ensure that all of my needs were met . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very much enjoyed my 5 nights at this modern style hotel . Located within walking distance to lots of restaurants , shopping , the Gold Coast and transit . Fe ##lt very comfortable walking in the surrounding area . The amenities were very nice . Breakfast ##s were delicious , coffee served in a French Press . Top sheet on bed is not standard ; this is a European style . She ##et was added upon request . Room was spacious and very clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good spot to stay when stating downtown Chicago . You can walk to most the attractions . Room ##s are large and comfortable . Price to value equation was good . Look for lower cost parking options to avoid the $ 70 per day hotel v ##alet fee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Its the only place to stay while in Chicago . . . . Restaurant , bar , front desk , Library . . . the rooms are divine ! I love this place ! ! ! ! ! Room ##s are the most comfortable , staff bends over backwards to assist with anything , the Bar is one of the best in town for value and at most ##phere . . . Its my home away from home in Chicago . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a lovely corner suite with great views , for the price of just a room in many Chicago hotels . V ##ER ##Y nice big swimming pool , on top floor with a surrounding view ! Full kitchen . Great staff , good location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were traveling with our infant son , and it is very nice to have two separate rooms . This way we could watch t ##v in the bedroom after our son went to sleep in the provided c ##ri ##b in the living room . This also has a pretty full sized kitchen , which is also nice while traveling with a child . The location is pretty central , and Eat ##ly is right around the corner , which I recommend for din ##ning with kids since it is a loud restaurant . Two down ##side : parking is expensive , and there was only one working elevator during our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker via Hot ##wire , and we were thankful that our g ##amble paid off . We would definitely choose this hotel in the future . It was in a great location for what we wanted to do [ food and sights in Lincoln Park , Old Town ] and is near the lake and the magnificent mile . We walked to Lakes ##hore Drive in the evening to view the moon and the lights of Navy Pier . Staff upgraded us from a room to a suite when they learned we were celebrating a birthday . The suite was spacious and comfortable and the ceiling shower was a unique experience . The lobby had live musicians throughout the evening and they were a delight to listen to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our first room was 101 , right next to the elevator for a floor that must house a hundred rooms . It sounded like every person who got off the elevator walked th ##ru our room , you could hear everything . Nearly the entire lobby has been turned into a bar . There are very few co ##zy little no ##ok ##s to sit in . Some of the charm of the lobby still exists with the beautiful ceiling , stairway ##s , etc . The rooms are old with minimal sink area . We had to upgrade to a king bed with a bath that was so small we could not keep our toilet ##ries in it . Need ##less to say we were disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was pet friendly and my first trip alone with my Be ##ag ##le . They were S ##O a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The Club Lounge was a huge plus . The waitress ##es went out of their way to make sure you were having a good time . I remember Connie Alex who went out of her way to get some snack ##s for my friend and I since they were out when we arrived . She was charming , friendly and very ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . I loved the location and my Be ##ag ##le even had a park to ' go pot ##ty ' . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location is just the s ##tra ##t for this great hotel . Close to many restaurants and train station . Staff is among the best . Room ##s are small but well decorated . Very comfortable air conditioning and room was very quiet on 20th floor . Not sure about lower floors . There is a Star ##bu ##cks , which is very convenient . Service is top notch . The lobby e ##voke ##s historic heritage of this hotel . You will feel special staying in this hotel . T ##ip : there is a Corner Baker ##y right next to this hotel and it is a great place for a quick breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is reasonably priced for the location it is in . If one likes the full flavor of Chicago , this hotel is 1 block from the Washington and Wells Orange Line loop exit , is 3 blocks from W ##ack ##er Ave , and the Chicago River , and within easy walking distance of many of the iconic Chicago spots such as Lou Mal ##nat ##i ' s . The staff is very helpful in finding your way anywhere . The rooms are com ##fy , although a bit small . And the bathroom ##s are small , with little counter space at the sink . But that is the only down ##side to this good hotel in a great location . Right next to a very good theater . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After being turn ##around at a hotel in the area that didn ' t have my hotel reservation ? ? I happen to go ##og ##le a near by hotel and came across The Ambassador . After telling the front desk agent my issue , She definitely made me feel relaxed when she told me " Don ' t worry about that you can stay here tonight " I ' m definitely glad I ##m did . Thanks MS . Kay for not only reminding me that screaming & yelling gets me nowhere ( ( inside ##r ) . But really the welcoming experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at the kin ##zie hotel was spectacular , due to the wonderful staff including r ##af ##i , p ##ius , Spencer Elsie Jerry , Katherine and all others involved in tend ##ing to all our wedding requests for the c ##ili ##no / Lyndon affair . Great job ! ! ! ! ! Will strongly consider a 2nd visit to the kin ##zie . . Matt c ##ili ##no . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is good , no complain ##s at all They have no room service and when I asked they told me that U ##ber Eat was available or take out from the Hotel Restaurant . Not the answer you want to hear after a long day . No coffee maker in the room 30 % of the fitness center working machines weren ’ t working . For sure I am not going back to this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this lovely hotel many times and always found it to be a pleasure . The rooms are beautiful and well appointed . The meeting rooms and gym are great . But the customer service keeps me coming back . All the staff are friendly , persona ##ble and professional . And then there are the charming q ##ui ##rky touches like the gold ##fish ! If you are looking for a place to stay with great access to Michigan Ave shopping , museums and Mill ##eni ##um Park this is a perfect location and you are a block and a half from the CT ##A Orange Line to travel other places in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great experience from check in to check out . Court ##eous staff . The fitness room is amazing . Room and bed comfortable . Both shower and tub options . Room has a small refrigerator , which is nice if you have food left ##over from dining out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I don ' t think we could have been more satisfied with our stay at the Hilton Chicago . What a beautiful hotel . When we first arrived we were checked - in by Julius Do ##xy . Our reservation was for a lake view room and Julius helped us get into the best available corner room on the 24th floor . Beautiful views of Millennium Park , Navy Pier , the Chicago sky ##line and Buckingham Fountain to name a few . Julius answered all of our questions about possible sites to see and visit during our 4 day stay . We could tell that he truly enjoyed helping us and he seemed to get much joy from it . He even told us where to find the best places to eat . And Kitty O ' Shea ' s , located in the Hilton , was a great place to eat as well . Thanks Julius for giving us a great start to our trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##led to Chicago for dinner and theatre celebrating my wife ' s birthday . Hotel staff made check in a breeze and upgraded room to suite and wished my wife a happy birthday . Room was very quite , clean , and extremely comfortable . Hotel bar is a very cool space with an evening wine hour . Location is perfect . De ##fin ##ite ##ly staying again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Move ##d my daughter from Los Angeles to Chicago . Bed Bath Beyond , Michigan Ave . , great restaurants all within a few blocks from hotel . Front office staff very helpful and friendly . Would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in one of the king corner suites and it was great space . We found our room and the hotel to be clean , the hotel staff was always kind , helpful , and friendly . The breakfast b ##uff ##et had many options and the wait staff were incredibly nice . Love ##d staying here and would recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a historic and uniquely decorated hotel . The hotel bar and restaurant were lively . There is a Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel that I used each morning and the hotel location is convenient ##ly located near Grant Park . The staff were helpful and made sure I had a good stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Del ##ight ##ful experience . Friendly staff . Del ##icious happy hour with Beer and Wine ! Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary hot breakfast . Big hotel but elevator were quick . Co ##m ##fy beds . Only down ##side was that the suite was a bit small . It felt like we were always running into each other or something . But overall a 5 ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very pleasant stay at Swiss ##ote ##l . The location is right on point , close to everything . The rooms were spacious , comfortable beds , and great views . The staff was always friendly and at ##ten ##tive . We enjoy our stay and would love to go back another time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] trip to Chicago for a get ##away , close to everything in downtown Chicago . Staff very helpful . Very clean facility . Breakfast was good . Everyone went out of there way to make sure you were taken care of including the house keeping staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Live in the ' b ##ur ##bs and don ' t want to climb behind the wheel when the party ends very late ( this one was 3 am ! ) so I took a chance . Got lucky with this reservation . Hotel has a nice , co ##zy , club ##by feel and is located in a s ##pi ##ffy neighborhood just five blocks from my event . I ' d go back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was perfectly located in the heart of The Ma ##gni ##fica ##nt Mile . The accommodation ##s were very comfortable , however our room could ' ve been cleaner . The front desk people were cord ##ial and they were prepared for our arrival , we got checked in very promptly [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed in Fair ##mont Millennium Park during the IT ##W Conference [ International Telecom Week ] for the past seven [ 7 ] years . The staff is very professional , re ##sp ##ons ##ive and provide exceptional service . Cody Cook the Fair ##mont Gold Manager and his Staff in Fair ##mont Executive Lounge set an example for [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is awesome . Te ##rri ##fic location and great accommodation ##s . The staff ##f was extremely helpful and the breakfast and evening social make this hotel a great value for the price . We can ' t wait to come back [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is located in a great area to go to shows , plays , great dining , shopping , etc . The de ##cor is luxurious : marble , wood and plus ##h carpet . Now that we are " empty nest ##ers " , we have a certain level of expectation , when we stay in hotels . The Palmer House was right in line with our expectations . Court ##eous staff , nice accommodation ##s and a ##cco ##uter ##ments , great room service and food , and a great location . We highly recommend The Palmer House . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has a good downtown location that allowed us to easily access the El and get to our specific destinations on this trip . The proximity to the El might be distract ##ing for some . I didn ' t hear it so much being on the opposite side of the building , but imagined it bothering people on the lower levels close to the street . The hotel itself is older , but taste ##fully decorated . It has a nice lobby with a modern look . There is a bar and a restaurant which we didn ' t utilize . The rooms are a decent size and functional . They carry the same modern de ##cor as the lobby . Basic ##ally , we chose this hotel for location . It was right in the downtown area , near subway lines , restaurants , and the river . Not a bad way to explore Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here to attend a conference at another hotel across the river . We enjoyed a few excellent restaurants in 5 - 10 min walking distance , so the location is excellent . The front desk was happy to help us with some special requests . Unfortunately there is no lounge , and as an Ambassador member that ’ s always a b ##um ##mer . But the service was excellent . Our flight was canceled , and it was super easy to arrange a late check out through the text ##ing the hotel does with you upon check in . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was fantastic seeing all the architecture and photographs of well - known stars and celebrities of yes ##tery ##ear . The dining experience in the restaurants on premises was phenomena ##l , and the staff was very kind . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay at the Talbot ##t ! The hotel is charming and sophisticated , service outstanding . The bathroom ##s are small but include nice am ##ent ##ities . The bar and restaurant are also great . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel itself was great . It was clean . Staff were friendly and helpful . The room was comfortable . The kids enjoyed the bay window with pillows for reading . We had booked through a third party and other learned about the 58 . 00 per day parking fee . A little shocked at that price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel , great location , great character , very s ##ty ##lish , feel like I ' m back in my college dorm . Love it ! Thanks to Gerry at the Des ##k and Gregory at the Door . I will be back again ! Breakfast was great although no toast ##er was provided , but the front desk did explain the valid reason as to why . All in All great place to stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the 2nd time I ' ve stayed and the hotel was as gorgeous as I remember ! I love the Art Dec ##o style . The lobby is stunning ! ! The beds are very comfortable . The entire hotel is clean . They give you a $ 10 raid the mini - bar coup ##on when you sign up for the rewards program . Happy at 5 ##PM in the lobby is great . But it ends promptly at 6 ##PM ! ! The location is great . Just a couple blocks from Clark / Lake stop and State Street . The staff is nice ; although since everything is so great I rarely interact ##ed with them except check in . I can ' t wait to come back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfectly located for that 3 or 4 day trip to Chicago . Located on Michigan in the middle of everything . We shop ##ped , did dinner ##s and saw two shows . L ##y ##ft is simple at this hotel . We needed a room with two beds and it was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I went to the hotel tired and willing to go to my room for a shower . However , the hotel was entirely sold out and I had to wait till 3 ##pm . Nonetheless , Ke ##enan , the con ##cier ##ge , went out of his way and made the executive decision to upgrade me to a nice view suite . Ke ##enan , thank you man ! You are the best ! Other than that , the view is outstanding with a corner on view on the lake and the canal . It was definitely one of the best rooms I have stayed in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I will return to this hotel when in Chicago . The con ##cier ##ge staff were wonderful . We loved each restaurant recommendation they offered . House ##keeping staff was great as well . Very clean , nice room . Great value too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently spent a Saturday night here and the hotel is in a great location in the heart of River North and is close walking distance to many of the tourist locations in the city . The room was very clean , comfortable beds , quiet and the free drinks and app ##eti ##zers and continental breakfast one each floor in the AM were much appreciated . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Even in the con ##cier ##ge rooms , needed repairs are openly visible : dresser doors that won ' t stay shut , ma ##rs and scratch ##es on furniture , etc . Even the shower curtain and its rod are dated ; it has been quite awhile since I had taken a shower in a crowded tub without a curtain rod that bowed out for additional space . Still , the location and amenities of the She ##rato ##n are hard to beat and the staff are pleasant , helpful , and knowledge ##able . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While attending a medical conference , we stayed at So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The location is great ; very close to the heart of the city . Check in was fast and staff were very friendly . Our room on the 20th floor ( facing John Hancock center ) was very comfortable and relaxing . Breakfast was very good and dinner at the hotel restaurant ( Cafe des Architect ##es ) was a wonderful experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Online checking in was great . Our room was very nice with a great view . We went to the re ##gen ##cy club and had a great experience . The food offerings were excellent and breakfast was more than we expected . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a quick one night get ##away to the City for Spring Break . We had 2 ten year olds along . They were so pleased with the milk and cookies that were brought to the room during turn - down service . The room was wonderful - clean and comfortable . We did eat the b ##uff ##et breakfast ( $ 100 for 2 adults and 2 children after tax and tip ! ! ) but we knew it was a s ##p ##lu ##rge . It was a great breakfast . Good baked products , o ##mel ##ettes , fresh fruit . Of course there is plenty to do and see right outside the hotel . Great location . Extreme ##ly helpful and friendly staff . It was a super fun quick trip to the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in the loop and not easy to get to Magic mile shopping area . Room ##s are small but staff is helpful . Only reason to stay here if your need is to be in the loop . There are other much better hotels on Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] OK - - one night of business trip and they ta ##cked on an " am ##eni ##ty fee " that totaled nearly $ 24 with tax . Seriously , these " am ##ent ##ity " fees are nothing more than a money grab and I expect better . Show ##er was a trick ##le . Never could get the wireless to work . Everything was clean and the room was otherwise nice . But I ' m going somewhere else next time . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Fell in love with the O ##m ##ni in Boston so our next trip we had to stay at the O ##m ##ni in Chicago , we look forward to stay at the O ##m ##ni on our next adventure , hopefully wherever we visit they have an O ##m ##ni there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wow - I loved this hotel ! It ' s massive , and I attended as part of a large conference , which made it very convenient . It was comfortable and clean . They upgraded my room ( as a Gold Bon ##voy member ) to a MA ##SS ##IVE suite , which made me feel like a rock - star . I really can ' t think of any negative ##s to this place . Some highlights : 1 . Location - right on the River ##walk , a 5 minute walk to downtown . 2 . Great fitness centre - room ##y with lots of machines and weights . 3 . Lu ##x ##uri ##ous lobby . 4 . Clean , modern rooms , comfortable beds , and modern bathroom ##s . 5 . Netflix on all the TV ##s ! This will be my preferred hotel when I come to Chicago in the future . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni has it all . It ' s in the heart of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Room ##s are large and comfortable , and the staff is very cheerful and helpful . They are also very competitive on rates when you compare against other suites [SEP]
1	[CLS] I tag ##ged along twice here with my fi ##an ##cée on a two Day lay over . The hotel is very close to Navy Pier and Millennium Park where there is always fun activities going on . The rooms are excellent and staff very friendly . They have a nice restaurant and bar . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My first experience with the Conrad Chicago . Very nice room at a fair price in a great location . Friendly and welcoming staff . Only stayed one night this time . Will definitely stay there again next time I ’ m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the hotel is a surprise lobby on 20th . floor ! ! go figure , Staff are fantastic and very helpful , rooms are large and very well set up . Great views a ##b ] n ##d location . first class travellers will love it , But a bit p ##ric ##y ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved at 2 . 45 ##pm to check in to our ‘ newly renovated Club Lounge room on the 33rd floor only to be told it wasn ’ t ready so we headed off to explore and wait . A ##rri ##ved back to hotel at 5 . 30 ##pm and had been assigned a tired out of date room on the 31st floor . No reasonable explanation provided why , clearly our room has been assigned to someone else . Not the usual level of service experienced at other She ##rato ##n hotels around the world . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont is primarily a business hotel during the week so it was nice and quiet for our Saturday night stay . We checked in early which we really appreciated . The person who checked us in was very nice . The room was very nice , clean and a good size . We were upgraded to a room with a better view , also a nice touch . The only negative was no mini fridge so there was no place to store our left ##overs . Also , the restaurant service was not the greatest . Personnel was in ##ex ##per ##ienced and it took a long time to get our food . Also , they advertised a br ##unch but it was not being served that day . The management needs to do a better job for the guests using the restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They don ’ t even provide free W ##i ##F ##i . . We didn ’ t know where swimming pool was but we were charged additionally for all this . . Even a local hotel would give these amenities for free . . should have been better . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here because it was closest to my office at the least offensive price for a recent work trip . It had been so long since my last stay there that I had forgotten why I stopped staying there . I won ’ t do it again . 2 different rooms had mold / mild ##ew problems ( I ’ m all ##ergic ) and poor ventilation . The staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and moved my from my first room that had a w ##hir ##ring motor sound that wouldn ’ t stop . 2nd room I was assigned also had mold / mild ##ew problems but I didn ’ t feel like going back to the front desk again . I just sucked it up . Hall ##way ceiling tiles on floor 15 had visible mold from a previous leak . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , inviting , no ##stal ##gic and contemporary with amenities . We arrived late on a Saturday night of a holiday weekend and were served quickly and politely , from the v ##alet , to the bell ##hop , to the re ##gis ##trar . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for about 3 days attending a conference . Right away , I was greeted by the door ##men with a smile . I had a diversion before landing so I was already flu ##stered but I am so thankful for Nicole T . She checked me in , moved me to a room with a gorgeous view and went above and beyond to answer all of my questions . Her knowledge of the hotel , and Chicago as a whole , is un ##mat ##ched . My conference took place in the hotel so everything was convenient . The location is perfect and I was able to travel to outside restaurants within 10 min ##s or so . I also enjoyed the Palm restaurant as well ( get the lo ##bs ##ter bi ##sque ) . Everything was perfect at Swiss ##ote ##l . I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone who is traveling for business or if you ' re with family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 3 nights for a business trip . Hu ##ge hotel , lobby areas and bars are f ##ab . Walking distance to all Chicago downtown has to offer . Lots to do at the hotel if you stay in . Room was dated but clean . Would stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I could not have been happier with this hotel . The room was beautiful and spacious . The amenities were excellent . The hotel restaurant and bar was great . And the place is located in the perfect location . I hadn ’ t stayed at a H ##ya ##tt property in years but my stay here will encourage me to try them going forward . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed three nights at Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mike recently . From the moment we emerged from our taxi , we felt very welcomed and valued as guests . Our room was upgraded without requesting this and the hotel was very busy . When something was requested , the request was fulfilled very quickly with a follow up phone call to be sure things we to our satisfaction . The location on Michigan Avenue made for an easy walk to most anywhere we wanted to go . We will definitely return to this hotel when we visit Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was ' expected ' , accommodation ##s were nice for a conference , with multiple rooms used for various break ##out sessions . Food provided was good , service seemed a little ' behind the ball ' at times . We got the discount ##ed rate for the rooms for the conference , there ' s no way I ' d think the room was worth the regular rate for what it was though [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is a beautiful , well - appointed hotel in a perfect location near Michigan Avenue and walking distance from many of the fun things to do in Chicago . The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble and the rooms have all the amenities of a luxury hotel . The restaurant / bar near the check - in desk is really nice with a long list of great w ##his ##kie ##s . The fitness center is also first class . My wife and I were there for the weekend to see a show and visit friends . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located , nice lobby , beautiful ball rooms , and all of that . Am ##eni ##ties in the bathroom are the same as inferior hotels . What it stroke me was that you have to pay 3 dollars for each bag . Yes , they will charge you for holding your luggage for a couple of hours . T ##HA ##T IS CH ##EA ##P ! I have not seen that in my life . Just ridiculous . Really bad ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This establishment has gone above and beyond . Starting from the v ##alet staff all the way down the line . The entire staff is working sea ##m ##lessly together to create comfort , luxury and extreme attention to detail for there customers . This was delivered to our room as a gift for my children just minutes after we checked in seeing that my boys love goose ##bu ##mp mystery books . Travis because of your acute passion for making people feel welcome I will never stay at another hotel when I ’ m in Chicago ! And I will only recommend the Ambassador hotel to everyone who asks for a recommendation . Thank you for making my family ’ s trip one of the most memorable . If there was a option for 10 stars I would have ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very impressed on my recent two night stay . Especially as the price was pretty low . The hotel is very clean and nice . Staff were helpful . The room was nice , large , modern and clean . G ##ym is OK - two t ##read ##mill ##s and some el ##liptic ##al trainers plus some weights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very nice but the customer service is poor . Night staff is lazy , several times walking in at night they don ’ t open the door just look at you , when I had luggage or other items . The night security guard ( older black guy ) is very rude ! ! ! He is di ##s ##res ##pect ##ful to the guest and I addressed it with night man ##ger , not sure if anything will be done , but I don ’ t think a hotel like this would want their hotel to be represented in the way he treats guests . The elevators take forever ! ! ! The rooms are very nice , they supply coffee and wine which is nice . Vale ##t is very nice , but very expensive . It was a nice hotel but with the experience I had , disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our son passed away at Northwestern medical hospital on August 29 , 2017 . We spent that night at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker hotel and were more than extremely impressed . The care and compassion from their staff was tremendous . Their kindness made our loss a small bit better . The room was beautiful and the service was beyond excellent . I wish I could rate this hotel higher than a five because it is more like at 10 . Thank you , K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . Mary ##beth West ##by [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad brand has consistently been good to me for business travel . The Chicago Conrad is comfortable and well - located , but it ’ s far from the brand norm . Room service missed a breakfast , losing the order . No apology or com ##p until I went back to The front desk to complain , which was heard . The restaurant was me ##dio ##cre and the night I arrived unable to provide its full menu with only bar food ; they had no chef . Zack at bar was great and door ##men were at ##ten ##tive . It ’ s just not a four to five star property in its management and the team struggles to provide consistency in service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to Chicago for a long An ##ivers ##ary weekend and had a great stay ! Our room was very nice and the window seat was great ! The staff was very friendly and helpful . We will definitely stay here again when back in Chicago ! One of our favorite hotels now ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were told by several people to stay here . Very nice rooms and the staff in every are was overly nice , cool or helpful . Great location , good restaurants , and great views . Only draw ##back for me it was pet friendly . Heard dogs barking at [UNK] . Made me wonder if a dog has p ##eed on my be recently . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is a historic hotel with charm . It ’ s not a new or contemporary hotel . The customer service is excellent . It ’ s located downtown where you can walk to parks , shopping , and several restaurants . The staff makes the experience great because they took the time to communicate with me during my stay to check in on me . The beds and pillows are very comfortable . Food , customer service , lobby , and meeting rooms are nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] . . . and everything has been more than we could ask for . Staff has been very very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the place is beautiful . Had a chance to walk around before it was time to the check in and the neighborhood is amazing too . Special thanks to K ##wa ##me at the front desk , he ' s been killing it . Making us feel right at home . Also Craig the bell ##hop , fun guy who is happy to help out . I ' ll be sure to update this at the end of our stay but so far everything is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our third time staying at a Kim ##pton Hotel , and every time the experience is fantastic . The front desk staff was very pleasant and cheerful , even at midnight when we arrived . The room was perfectly clean , and we absolutely loved the little sitting area in front of the window overlooking W ##aba ##sh . A well stock ##ed mini - bar and plus ##h bath ##robe ##s round out the great experience . The only slight de ##tract ##ors to the room were 1 ) the room did not provide slip ##pers , and 2 ) the bath ##tub was not very deep . And I guess it would have been nice to have at least one free bottle of water in the room ( I think other Kim ##pton Hotels have done this ) , though there is a 7 - Eleven right across the street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] this hotel is central ##ly located . beautiful interior and spacious rooms . Within walking distance to just about everything on MI ##rac ##le mile . Great restaurants and shopping all within ##g walking distance . Very court ##eous staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] By the time I arrived , there was some network out ##age and the check - in was slow ( this is genuine and don ' t have much concern here ) . Afterwards I was assigned a room , and was given a key , which would never work . I came all the way down and waited again to be issued with a new room . The room was so hot for some reason even with the room temperature at 66 F . The rest ##room is super old and the shower was only a hand shower , from which water would come very slow . It would take 2 days to entirely wet your body . And the bath area water would creep into the main bath room area and make it wet making it uncomfortable to stand in ##front of mirror . Si ##mp ##ly , the rest ##room was a very bad experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great time . Use the next door parking lot by booking it via online to avoid $ 75 per night parking fee at the hotel . Room ##s are nice , good location , fitness room is great , free drinking water and fruits are available in the fitness room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two nights here over the weekend . Excellent location and easy to find . Love ##ly , friendly staff and a q ##ui ##rky design . Room ##s are clean and fresh and the bed was super com ##fy . Love ##d the compliment ##ary breakfast and happy hour . Looking forward to returning in April , June , July and September ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect price to quality ratio , i mean really perfect ! Super nice staff at the door and front desk . The best of it : the bar and its ultra g ##rien ##dly bartender ##s . This is an old building with recent updates , it looks ma ##rve ##lous . But for you fancy people , remember is an old building in the sense of many years old building . Room ##s are clean , Italian ( Fr ##ette ) linen ##s and very spacious walk in closet ##s . Very central location , 40 minutes $ 30 U ##ber trip from O ' Hare airport . Important to mention is the Jean - George restaurant on the other side of the lobby , very fine excellent food . Will go back to Chicago and stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont is a nice hotel , but it is expensive . If you are attending an event in one of the connecting properties it ' s convenient . It ' s a bit of a walk to get to public transportation . The bed was comfortable and they provide robes for your stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A beautiful , historic building in a beautiful area of Chicago . I loved our room - it had a bedroom area and a separate sitting / living room area with a desk . White d ##rap ##es all around , which bright ##ened the room and could also be used to separate the two areas . The staff were so helpful and kind . You truly felt that they cared for your well - being during your stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at Ki ##nz ##ie was anything else than outstanding . From the check in process , where Robert and Kai ##tly ##n showed how welcoming and efficient they were . The room had everything could ask for , with a personal and unique de ##cor that makes this bout ##ique hotel one of my favorite options for staying in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful two night stay at the O ##m ##ni . The King Suite was very comfortable and the customer service was wonderful . We really enjoyed breakfast . I was partial to the f ##rench toast , while my husband enjoyed the light flu ##ff ##ly wa ##ffle made to order . It is situated perfectly between at ##ta ##ctions on Michigan Avenue ( close to N ##eim ##an Marcus , Bloom ##ing ##dale ##s , Macy ' s , American Girl , etc . ) . Would definitely stay again without hesitation . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el has remained our hotel of choice in Chicago for over ten years and they never have disappointed us . When we came in , they were not at full capacity and g ##rac ##iously gave us a compliment ##ary upgrade to a suite . They continue to meet all our needs and the entire staff is im ##bu ##ed with a sincere projection of hospitality and friend ##liness . There is no question about it , we will only look to the So ##fit ##el for our next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an outstanding hotel . Our home away from home in Chicago . Custom ##er service is the name of the game here . Everyone from Mir ##sad ##a , Charles and D ##wayne are all outstanding at their jobs ! The location of this hotel is also an important reason why we stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco is just off W ##ack ##er Drive Near the bridge over the river that starts the " Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile " . We took the train in from the airport and walked 2 blocks to the hotel along the river . Our room was nice , well - appointed , and we looked out over the river at the Trump Tower . The staff was particularly nice and helpful . In the mornings they have freshly br ##ew ##ed coffee in the lobby and at 5 in the afternoon they serve wine and light snack ##s in the same area . We thoroughly enjoyed relaxing with other guests after an busy day on the town . We have stayed at this hotel a number of times in the past and have always been pleased . The restaurant attached to the hotel is also good for breakfast , lunch and dinner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel last week and knew they were sold out . The front desk actually held a large suite for myself and provided me with a nice upgrade . The room was spectacular and staff could not have been any nice . I highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I stay at the Fair ##mont each year a weekend before Christmas to see Chicago during the holidays . We keep returning to this hotel because of the people working there , because the hotel is beautiful , and the views are amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came to town , 3 / 11 - 3 / 13 , to see the Black ##hawks and Bulls play . I was debating on staying in River North or deeper into the gold coast . I had lived in Chicago almost 20 y ##rs prior , and of course the choice was easy . . . Where to stay ? ? ? I saw the Talbot ##t pop up on suggestions to stay . I decided to give it a try . I was extremely happy with my stay . The friend ##liness of the staff , professional ##ism of house keeping , front door service by D ##wayne , and how nice the room was and comfort of the bed . I will definitely stay here again next time in Chicago . A true hidden g ##em in a bout ##ique hotel . Thank you to the staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel , in my opinion , is the most value for your dollar . It is ch ##ic , well designed and perfectly located in the heart of Chicago . Room ##s are well designed and comfortable , the restaurant has an excellent menu and the bar with outdoor seating provides for an excellent atmosphere . Short walk from the Lake and Michigan Avenue . Re ##lax ##ing br ##unch on a beautiful Sunday morning outside is what the city visit is all about . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I visited she ##rato ##n grand Chicago before last de ##ce ##mber and everything was amazing . Its located in a strategic point of the city with great views .

1	[CLS] I had the pleasure of staying at this property for business . Andrea and Andrew at the front desk have a great sense of pride in displaying Hilton ’ s vision to share the light and warmth of hospitality . We are able to check in early and we ’ re also upgraded to execute rooms for being Gold members . The elevator system was a little confusing as some don ’ t access certain floors , but I definitely would stay here again . Thanks for all you guys do ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We go to Chicago every year at Christmas . Hotel was very nice . Suite ##s are very large . Hi ##de a beds pretty com ##fy . Great parade route view of Michigan a ##ve if you want to watch from inside . Good shopping location as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel really made our family spring vacation perfect . The location is great - we could walk nearly anywhere we wanted to go for shopping or dining . The v ##alet service is far above average in their friend ##liness and timeline ##ss . We will certainly stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We used credit card points to book this hotel over Labor Day weekend and chose a Suite style 2 room layout . Wow , were we pleased . The room was on a corner , with awesome views of the Chicago river and city h ##ust ##le and bust ##le . The rooms window ledge ##s were so wide and long that my 6 ' 4 " son and 5 ' 9 " daughter both nap ##ped or just stretched out to read during day and evening time in the room . Dad got pat ##s on back from kids and wife that I reserved the " best room ever . " That never happens , cause I tend to go more budget . . . . . but s ##p ##lu ##rg ##ing on this room was worth it . I also enjoyed the free cruiser bike rental and rode miles up and down the lakes ##hore drive bike paths . Fun ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were blown away by the beauty & service of your hotel . It was convenient to everything we wanted to do . Because we were there 2 nights we were coming and going . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our taking out and returning our car in a reasonable amount of time . We will be back ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We went to Chicago for a wedding and stayed at the Conrad Hotel . The hotel experience itself was amazing . From the moment we arrived there were staff waiting there to assist us in parking our car , checking us in and our bags were delivered so quickly they almost beat us to our room ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my favorite hotel in Chicago , 1 . it is across the street from my favorite bout ##ique . The steak ##s are incredible , the hotel is very old g ##lam magic , with a Starr ##bu ##ck on property . Amazing hotel , great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , clean , modern , friendly staff . In town for convention , hotel was never crowded in public places , staff were awesome friendly . Half block off Michigan but very quiet . Will stay again next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay at She ##rato ##n Grand . The hotel was te ##rri ##fic and the rooms were perfect . Location cannot be beat . Right on the river in the middle of everything we wanted to do . Miracle Mile , Navy Pier , walked to Museum campus . Lots of restaurants close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fe ##lt very fortunate to stay at the So ##fit ##el for a girl ' s get together . The location is excellent . Easy walking distance to restaurants and sites . The staff were so friendly and willing to help out with recommendations . The parking ramp is right next door to the hotel and that will save you a lot of money in parking if you use Spot Hero app . Will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The most important for us would always be location , followed by comfort . This is both . The location is excellent , and the beds and pillows are comfortable . The only service that we tried to use is the business center , but it is in a Fed ##E ##x store , and you have to pay . Other than that it ' s excellent . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The location of the hotel was great ! The rooms are very nice and spacious . Most of the staff was very friendly . For people wanting to stay by Michigan Ave I would definitely recommend this hotel . Especially for those that want spacious rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was there 2 years ago and still talk about how horrible and utterly creepy this place was . Unfortunately I was stuck there for business . This place was upgraded by Hilton ? I can only imagine how g ##rue ##some it must have been before . Tiny s ##hab ##by room with a disgusting bathroom . I had a me ##mor ##ably miserable stay . It ’ s taken this long - 2 years - to get over it . Maybe I ’ m not over it yet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We flew to Chicago on a direct flight from Edinburgh on 24th May . We arrived at O Hare airport Chicago were we got a taxi to our hotel which was in a very central area , in fact it was ideal as we could walk about everywhere . The Hilton hotel was ideal , great room on the 6th floor large king size bed , plenty of floor space and all the amenities we could want . The weather was fantastic 88 to 97 de ##g . We only saw rain when we were at the airport to fly home and there was a thunder ##storm with lightning , so our flight was delayed in leaving by about an hour . We use to go for breakfast most mornings to a restaurant called Yo ##lk , it was fantastic food here and staff were really helpful . We would definitely recommend going to Chicago as there was plenty to do and see . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed two nights at the So ##fit ##el Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for a conference . My check - in and check - out experiences were smooth and easy . I got there early and was going to just check my luggage , but the front desk person secured a room for me to check in early . The room I stayed in was clean , comfortable and luxurious . Great hotel , great location , great staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel with fantastic service ! The daily compliment ##ary happy hour from 5 - 7 is definitely worth it , especially with Josh as the bartender ! He truly makes it fun and is great at what he does . 5 stars ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent service all around . I had a very short stay . . . about 12 hours , and what I experienced was excellence . I rarely complete surveys , and think highly enough of this hotel that I took the time to complete a survey . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have stayed at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago on several occasions over the past 15 years . Each time I have been impressed with the professional ##ism of the entire staff , from the front desk to the house ##keeping personnel . And they do an excellent job of keeping the interior updated , elegant , and im ##ma ##culate . Always a top notch stay . My travel companion commented on the comfort and quality of the bed ##ding . And the views of the river and city are extraordinary every time I have visited . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed overnight at the Kim ##pton after seeing Beautiful at the Cadillac Palace Theatre next store . Very nice lobby and hotel had plenty of history . Front desk staff very nice and helpful throughout . Bar was great with friendly bartender ##s and plenty of different types of seating . Only complaint on bar was that it doesn ' t stay open late enough and there are no others in the immediate area open past 10 : 30 ##pm which we didn ' t understand after coming back from the theatre . Room was comfortable but small , bathroom so small it was comic ##al - - couldn ' t open the bathroom door if the closet was also open . But quiet and bed was comfortable . Would def ##inate ##ly stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were a large group staying at this lovely hotel near Millennium Park in Chicago . The hotel location is nice and one may be lucky to get a room with a nice view . The staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Food was very good and the meeting rooms were numerous and appropriate for our meetings . It is a short walk from the CT ##A station , which can be reached from either airport . Bed ##s are comfortable and rooms are nice . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good experience other than hearing some noise from a room next door . Staff took care of it . Nice toilet ##ries , plenty of storage space , nice views , good location , friendly staff , class ##y de ##cor . I would return and recommend this place to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town for a conference , I selected this hotel because of the high rating on Trip ##A ##d ##visor . Me and my fi ##ance ##e we were extremely pleased with the selection , since this hotel is easy walking distance to the River Walk and to a lot of Downtown attractions . Staff was very polite and professional and room nice and clean . W ##i - Fi is free after signing up for Kim ##pton ' s Ka ##rma . There is a very nice Morton ' s around the corner and the iconic Chicago Deep Di ##sh Pi ##zz ##eria Un ##o is very close . We count to return when in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I arrived here during the hotel worker ' s strike which meant that it was a bit noisy ( I do support their strike , however ) . This is a huge hotel and could probably do with a bit of T ##LC to get it up to modern standards . It ' s comfortable , central ##ly located and close to Millennium Park and the main shopping areas . No free w ##i - fi which I really expect as a guest at any decent hotel these days and the cafe is a little run down and could do with an upgrade . Dec ##ent hotel , but there are better in Chicago for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House has lovely Art No ##uveau de ##cor . The entrance auditorium is amazing , staff helpful and friendly . Room ##s very spacious , but the bathroom ##s need some up ##grading . Very convenient for the downtown loop area , the museum of art with its fantastic collection of French I ##mp ##ression ##ist paintings , the Chicago Symphony Orchestra just around the corner , and many great restaurants . Me ##mor ##able [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was excellent . I was luck ##ily able to book through Hotel Tonight for an excellent price . The room was much nice ##r than I expected and the service was top notch . The location is great , 10 minute walk to metro , 10 minute walk to Lake Trail , 5 minute walk to lots of shopping . I would definitely recommend , especially if you can find a deal as I did . The only down ##side is that if you have a car parking is costly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was a bit price ##y , but that might just be because it ' s in Chicago - - compared to other hotels I was considering , it was cheap ##est I think . Suite was much larger than I was expecting - - tons of space ! Breakfast was actually really great ( I usually pass on a free hotel breakfast because it ' s just sad - looking car ##bs ) , and the staff was friendly and helpful . Absolutely exceeded expectations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect weekend get ##away . Great location to restaurants and shopping . Super staff . Breakfast b ##uff ##et is one of the best anywhere . Room ##s are plenty big and have awesome views of the city . You can not do better to be close to all shopping [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great weekend in Chicago . I called the So ##fit ##el ahead of our arrival to request a c ##ri ##b , when we arrived the c ##ri ##b was in the room with a stuffed animal and toilet ##ries kit for our son , very cute . Room was average size with a larger than average bathroom with separate shower and bath . The hotel is about two blocks off Michigan Avenue and easy walking distance to many Chicago highlights . The parking is steep , only v ##alet is available for $ 72 dollars a night . We parked a couple blocks away for a third of the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel itself is pretty cool I guess . Taking out the pool to add a fitness center was weird , but whatever . What really piss ##es me off is the hidden fees . I read everything when I got my email confirmation ( bought through T ##ick ##ets at Work ) and no one ever said anything about an ‘ amenities fees ’ . It ’ s $ 20 a night which they then charge tax for . Not a big deal if you ’ re only staying one night , but for me it came out to be $ 117 . 40 for five nights . No chill , guys . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kay was fantastic ! Kay is an employee at Gold Coast ( Chicago ) Ambassador and she made the experience at her property an outstanding one . I recommend this brand of hotel and this particular property for those traveling to Chicago ( downtown ) whether locally or internationally . The property is very clean , the staff is very professional ( Kay ) , and the bar area , including fireplace , really sets the tone and am ##bian ##ce for a co ##zy and memorable stay . Kay made it a great stay ! I hope she continues to receive opportunities to grow within the Ambassador brand , and even if she decides to change companies . . . I know she will be an outstanding asset and leader . Thank you , Ambassador Chicago . Thank you , Kay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Other than the service strike , the stay was pleasant . I would recommend this hotel to others for location and quick access to ##6 Michigan Ave shopping and beach access . The rooms though could use a bit of up ##grading . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The views from our corner room on the 28th floor were outstanding . The corner room provided L ##OT ##S of windows on two sides of the building . The staff is helpful and at ##ten ##tive . The upper W ##ack ##er Drive / lower W ##ack ##er Drive con ##fuse ##s most GPS maps , but if you pay attention you can navigate properly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall experience was very good . Re ##ception staff was very friendly and efficient . Only draw ##backs were that rooms were made up rather late . Also elevator wait time is long . Did not use restaurant , but bar service was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location , within walking distance to everything we were doing . The staff was extremely helpful . Ph ##yl ##ici ##a at the front desk helped us receive and transmit legal documents in a rushed situation without batting an eye . At the door , Kevin continually gave us good walking directions and made sure we had a taxi when we needed one . The room was lovely . We had one in the 11th floor facing the river . I sat in that window seat quite a bit , soaking in the view . The food served in the restaurant downstairs was also good and served quickly when we were in a rush . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had the pleasure of seeing Din ##ka our hostess and Yu ##gen our server every morning of our stay . Everything we asked for was provided with pro ##mpt service and a smile . Besides the breakfast food being amazing the attention to detail and service is definitely what kept us coming back . Thank you Yu ##gen and Din ##ka for making our Chicago stay even that more enjoyable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay and we like the hotel very much . It is a beautiful property that was built almost 100 years ago so the rooms are designed with the idea you will be out of the room most of the time either in the city or relaxing in the lobby which we were . We don ' t go to Chicago to sit in the room . We found the staff to be very outgoing , friendly and helpful . It is convenient to most of downtown as well to the CT ##A if you want to go to other areas of town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent value for our room and overall stay . Clean and comfortable room , perfect location for restaurants and out ##ings , and extremely friendly staff starting when we stepped out of the U ##ber and onto the curb . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location and all the amenities for a family trip ! Clean and nice rooms / perfect size . Very manage ##able walking distance from just about everything and a $ 6 - 10 dollar cab fare to Willis Tower and Union Station . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , quiet and comfortable , convenient ##ly located across from the River Walk & Navy Pier . Restaurant ##s and shopping within walking distance . The Museum and A ##qua ##rium not far from hotel . U ##ber and lift pick up areas are right outside the hotel and easy to find . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby area is interesting , and de ##cor is attractive mix of traditional and modern . Hotel rooms are fairly small . Easy to open room door and hit bathroom door . Overall quiet though , which is nice . Bath ##rooms tiny in re ##mo ##del ##ed older building . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Blues Festival trip . . . this hotel was just a 5 minute walk from Millennium Park ! A great hotel , price ##y for me but accommodation ##s , staff , Earth ##a Kit ##t making a great Bombay ma ##rt ##ini , I really enjoyed ! Also , the park yourself option was absolutely awesome ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions perfect , location excellent , and very helpful , friendly , professional staff . Restaurant and bar superb , as was the wine bar . Room ##s have all of the creature comfort ##s needed for a business trip ( USB ports , etc ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a first stay at Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . It is located in downtown Chicago , in a great location . There are several good restaurants in the immediate area , and shopping in a short walk away . The front desk staff is very friendly , and the rooms are large and spacious . The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in . We had a room with tall curved windows and a seat ##ee for relaxation . You can ' t go wrong booking at room at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . While they don ' t have a restaurant at the hotel , an adjacent restaurant does provide room service to the Ki ##nz ##ie - but they will only allow you to charge it to the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our view s ##tin ##ks but we appreciate how quiet our room is . Great location . Coffee in am and wine for PM . Bed ##s super com ##fy . And great shower water pressure . Fitness room is just what we needed and staff is friendly and helpful [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t is a bout ##ique hotel that has been restored , yet still has the 1920 ' s feel and v ##ibe . The rooms are ups ##cale , comfortable , spacious . The staff were beyond nice and a ##cco ##mo ##dating . It is in the heart of downtown , walking distance to just about everything ! Great bar and restaurant . We would definitely stay there again ! The Con ##cier ##ge was very knowledge ##able and inform ##ative . Also , a shout out to Perry , who handled our luggage and MA ##N ##Y other things . He is the man to go to if you want info . on Chicago ! He could not have been more court ##eous , genuinely caring and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Francesca was amazing - she deserves to win the trip contest . B ##less her soul . 10 / 10 would recommend to a friend . She was u ##ber friendly and had great drink recommendations for me and my b ##uds visiting from Michigan . [UNK] praise be Francesca ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful space , friendly and professional staff . Everything all in one place . Room ##s were booked when I arrived but front desk made easy accommodation and provided a sea ##m ##less move to my actual room the next morning . Great late night service and C ##VS right around the corner for anything you left at home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] - Great location on Randolph . - Fair ##ly reasonably priced - I got the King Suite for less than $ 200 a night . - Room ##s were clean . A slight bit of wear , but still in good shape . I don ’ t care for Art Dec ##o , so the de ##cor and design didn ’ t appeal to me , but that ’ s just a personal preference . - Free glass of prose ##cco from 5 - 6 is a nice way to un ##wind after a day of travel and work . - Pretty loud H ##VA ##C system that woke me every time it kicked on . - Thin walls , but it ’ s a historic building so that ’ s to be expected . - Sur ##p ##rising ##ly good shower water pressure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience . My wife and I were there for a family event and stayed a few extra days to enjoy the city . Perfect location , friendly efficient staff , good restaurant food . Overall very good value . Large comfortable room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There was limited information given concerning the am ##bie ##nce and fluid ##ity of the stay . No mention of additional costs that could possibly be incurred . The staff at this facility was not am ##ena ##ble to explanations where no directions were posted . Room was hot and services were limited for the prices being re ##mit ##ted . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely hotel in the middle of everything you ' d want to do in Chicago . The staff is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the rooms are attractive and very clean . There ' s fresh coffee put out in the morning ( loved the ice coffee when it was 90 degrees ) and wine is served around 5 ##pm . Easy walking to most everywhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I traveled to Chicago to attend a friend ' s b ##day party . This was the closest major hotel to the venue . Dec ##ent room with a king bed , large closet . The bed was interesting ##ly lower to the ground . The fitness room in the lower lobby is small , only has 2 t ##read ##mill ##s , one el ##liptic ##al , two weight machines and dumb ##bell ##s . The neighborhood is residential , so don ' t expect to walk out into city life with stores , restaurants , etc . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Talbot ##t for a wedding . The staff was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and en ##aging . The hotel itself is beautiful , clean , and a perfect location . We enjoyed br ##unch one morning and found the staff and food to be excellent ! Would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked a room at the last minute at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Hotel in Chicago . Great location with a very good price , under $ 150 per night . The front desk staff was pleasant and professional and dealt with a booking issue that popped up under my name . The issue was resolved in less than 15 minutes . Although small , the room was very clean and well appointed . The bell ##hop who brought up my luggage was professional and persona ##ble . It is an older hotel but kept up well and clean . I would stay here again when in Chicago , especially with the good price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing location about 5 / 10 minute walk from the river walk and the W ##rig ##ley building . Every staff member we encountered gave us great service and the room was spacious , well equipped and looks more modern than many other Home ##wood suites I have visited . Would definitely return if ever back in this lovely city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hat ##s off to reception - it was busy for the entire day , line of people waiting to check in - and it was handled very well , polite and professional . We truly enjoyed the stay there . The property is a bit older but well maintained . Room ##s are great sizes , warm and co ##zy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel is great , right in the middle of down ##ton in walking distance to great places to go and restaurants . The staff was great as well . Especially Wilson O ##ls ##rud , Charlie and Natalie with Hilton Grand V ##aca ##tions , helpful with directions as well as giving great information about future trips and Hilton Honors rewards . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , but not the best service . Had to wait nearly 2 hours to get a room after arriving after 1 pm . . . packed solid and no offers of any g ##rat ##uity , drink etc while you wait . For a hotel at those rates , it leaves a bit to be desired . Nice fitness room , great views , very spend ##y . Check out the Mar ##riot ##t and London house before you lock in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie for 4 nights while in town on business . The room was updated and clean and hotel is walking distance to almost everything you could want . While I agree the hotel ' s deposit and fees are on the price ##y side , as I was on the ' company dim ##e ' , this was not much of a concern . ( If looking for a family trip , this may not be the best option . ) The best thing about the hotel is the service and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff ! They were exceptional ! All of the employees went above and beyond and really seemed to enjoy their jobs . Drake , in particular , was most helpful to me both during my visit and afterwards ( as I had to live - chat with him to obtain an item ##ized bill . ) I would definitely stay here again - mainly for the superb staff ! : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] I met Hugo at the bar and let me tell you how great his hospitality was . He is extremely at ##ten ##tive , social and energetic . He gets E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING R ##IG ##HT ! I honestly could recommend him for any role in any business because of his rap ##port building and connecting . He really knows how to make you feel comfortable and even confident about being here at the Swiss ##ote ##l . He needs a raise ! Or even a PR ##OM ##OT ##ION ! Wow , W ##HA ##T A G ##U ##Y ! I ’ d hire him if he wasn ’ t so dedicated to Swiss ##ote ##l . However , his loyalty is respected and I cannot wait to come back to visit him ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is not any better than many less expensive hotels . My daughter booked two rooms for one night ' She did this as a celebration of my 80 ##th birthday ! She requested early entry to rooms , rooms next to one another , a bottle of champagne and sweet ##s in my room upon arrival . NO ##NE OF THE ##SE R ##E ##Q ##UE ##ST ##S W ##ER ##E H ##ON ##OR ##ED ! In my room ; the drain in the bath was very slow ; by the time the shower was finished , the water was almost up to the knees , the TV did not work much of the evening , the coffee maker did not work . That ' s about it for the bad stuff . On the good side ; most of the staff was cord ##ial and helpful ( a staff member brought me new coffee maker at 7 ##AM } The breakfast was good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago during a weekend get ##away . I reserved a room with two double beds but at reception they kindly offered a compliment ##ary upgrade to a King bed since I ' m a Silver Hilton Honors member . The room was worn out , had two windows on a dark airs ##haft , constant ventilation noise , and the sound of elevators that was loud enough to make me think they were going up and down in the hallway . If you ' re going for a conference and get a special rate or you want to pay the high price of a lake view room , go for it and enjoy the great location . If you don ' t get a deal , look at the many other options in the area and if you do get offered an upgrade there , ask a lot of questions ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My company has hosted a series of monthly meetings over the past 6 months and this was by far everyone ' s favorite venue . The guest rooms , meeting space , and am ##bian ##ce was amazing , but the food / catering created the biggest buzz . During our 4 days , lunch earned a standing o ##vation twice ( we don ' t normally c ##lap and cheer for a meal ) . As meeting organizer , the service was the most important aspect , and the banquet staff definitely raised the bar ; they made suggestions and improvised on my behalf , all ##ev ##iating a lot of the work I normally need to look after . They also quickly solved a last minute issue , when a pre - arranged evening venue fell through the day before . Thanks to all of you for such an amazing and productive week ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay with a friend . In the business area of Chicago . Near ##est CT ##A around 10 / 12 minute walk . Love ##d the way they gave us $ 10 credit a day for not having our room cleaned every day . S ##pent on drinks at the bar . Both room and bathroom large and spacious . All staff friendly and helpful . Great stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thank you so much for such a lovely stay . The hotel was lovely , as well as the staff . D ##wayne was exceptional with his customer service for us as we were coming and going from the hotel . Looking forward to our next stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just got home from our stay at the All ##egro . We loved it . The lobby was beautiful , the staff was friendly . The hotel is located in the heart of downtown , close to many city attractions . The bed was wonderful ##ly com ##fy , the the ##rm ##ost ##at actually responded to our te ##mp changes and the shower had surprisingly great water pressure and room for a re ##va ##mp ##ed older hotel . It was great . We really enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was huge and well appointed . The con ##cier ##ge service was really good , and when it snow ##ed hard one day we could while away time exploring the massive facility . The indoor , heated pool also came in handy on this day . A short walk from Yo ##lk ( which we love ) and right across the road from the Park and Fountain . Easy walk to the Museums and the A ##qua ##rium too . A great spot for a good walking , family holiday . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Reservation ##s was very easy to include my All ##er ##gen - free request , the room was ample size for two people and the meeting rooms were well maintained throughout a two - day conference . The food was excellent quality including g ##lut ##en - free options . Alex at check ##out was very helpful and professionally friendly . Would come back to this property for other trips to Chicago . Well done overall experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel was excellent , I couldn ' t imagine it will be so in the middle of everything . The breakfast was very nice , fruits , cereal , eggs , milk , juice , etc more than enough to start a great day in Chicago Downtown , if you want more than that many restaurants a just less than 1 block on any direction . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Watch for the parking it is 67 dollars a night so find it somewhere else or get it included in your price . The service is great . The staff at outside desk and front desk will help you with everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a 3 night stay at the Monaco in early Nov ##er ##mber , in a king room del ##uxe with views of the Chicago river . The rooms are on the small side , but are clean and the bed very comfortable . There is a nice window seat where you can sit and watch the world go by with a cup of coffee . Re ##ception are friendly and helpful . There is free coffee downstairs and a nice area to sit and relax , as well as an early evening wine reception . The hotel is in a great area , well situated for the metro , the river , Mill ##eni ##um Park , Soldier Field and shopping . We also had breakfast and dinner one night at the hotel bar / restaurant , which was very good . An excellent place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I loved the room and also the feel of the carpet on our bare feet , so much so that it would be nice to learn the make and design of the carpet for a home re ##mo ##del ##ing project ! ! ! After not ##ifying the front desk of a loose f ##au ##ce ##t handle in the bath ##tub / shower maintenance promptly tightened the set screw in it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for the last few years , and it ' s still excellent choice in downtown Chicago . They have wonderful eve receptions , pretty fair morning breakfast and internet all included . Very court ##eous staff and perfect location . I think I ' m starting to recognize some of the same staff from year to year , and staff retention speaks very well of the place also . At ##e dinner across the street at Harry Cara ##y ' s . Nothing but good things to say about the place . Will definitely stay here again next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well decorated and clean . Very com ##fy beds . Quite noisy ; didn ’ t appear to be any window sound ##proof ##ing so was difficult to sleep early hours . L ##NG que ##ues for coffee . Chao ##tic service at lobby bar / restaurant ( e ##g no - one knew how to work the new coffee machine ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , rooms , staff A ##wes ##ome ! Places were a walking distance , staff people was very prepared and friendly and with full of service act ##it ##ud . Room was very quiet , comfortable and super clean . Am ##eni ##ties and facilities were awesome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We go to Chicago often , and in the past - - 6 years ago always stayed at the Conrad Hotel above Nord ##strom ' s on Michigan a ##ve , however it closed and a new hotel occupied the space . Tri ##ed the hotel but did not meet our expectations . We then choose a new 5 star hotel and were very pleased , however on this trip we decided to stay at the new Conrad on Erie street . Our stay was wonderful , staff were extremely friendly , the room was excellent , location great and food on sight was delicious . I would recommend The Conrad to all that go to Chicago . Great place to stay and we will certainly be returning . Ku ##dos to the Conrad ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , we had a great experience with this hotel . The staff is very friendly and helpful , our suite was spacious and recently renovated ( May 2016 ) , it was quiet and very baby - friendly . The location is wonderful - walk to lots of restaurants , the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and Navy Pier . Keep in mind if you ' re requesting a c ##ri ##b , they offer a Pack ' n ' Play and we were not able to assemble ours . ( Fortunately our baby was happy to sleep on a blanket on the floor ! ) There are only 2 elevators and the hotel was sold out the days that we stayed there - for one day an elevator was broken down and there were line - ups to use the working elevator . However , this was resolved relatively quickly . I would recommend this hotel to families looking for a great downtown location and good value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only stayed 1 night but I loved this hotel ! We got there a few hours before check in time but they let us check in anyway ##s . Also , we got 4 gold coins to use for free drinks at their bar from 5 - 8 ! The room was nice , clean and modern . They have breakfast on every floor right across from the elevators , which I felt was so convenient , and there was a good amount of options . They even provide a tray in the room for carrying your food . The location was perfect for us , all of the activities we wanted to do were all within a 10 - 20 min walk ( River ##boat Tour , Millennium Park , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , John Hancock building ) . Next time I ’ m in Chicago I ’ ll definitely be staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , comfortable rooms with sufficient fitness facilities [ if you arrive early in the morning ] and locations for informal gatherings . The All ##egro has some of the best shower ##s of the various hotels we ' ve stayed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was the first time I ' ve stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and can ' t say enough good things about this property . The location is great and puts you close to everything , the rooms are well appointed , and it has an ups ##cale bout ##ique atmosphere . The only negative was the hotel ' s restaurant was under renovation during our stay , but we were told it would be opening in a few weeks so that probably won ' t be an issue for anyone reading this review . I would recommend up ##grading to a river view so that you can get the most of the great window seats . Our ##s had a single oversized window where you could sit and read or just take in the view . There are so many hotel choices when visiting Chicago , but I would definitely put this one on my short list . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for two nights on a business trip recently . I thought my single queen room was small and bathroom needed to be renovated and the carpet in the hallway ##s and rooms could use an upgrade . I wish this property offered liquid bath gel . Front desk staff and the team at UP ##S store was te ##rri ##fic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff was very court ##eous and helpful . Room was clean and class ##y . Located on Ma ##g Mile with diverse options of restaurants and shopping . Conference rooms are well furnished with audio equipment . Lu ##nch and break re ##f ##resh ##ments were excellent . High ##ly recommend O ##m ##ni Hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is quite obviously an older hotel . There ' s a difference however in an older , historic building , and one that ' s used and worn . The lobby and rooms could use up ##dating desperately ! Service was just ok , no one went above or beyond , and I could feel it with the semi lack of attention in clean ##liness . There were discarded food tray ##s , glasses , and trash left in hallway ##s for hours at a time . If it weren ' t for the location , I wouldn ' t imagine staying here . There are many hotels around to choose from with comparable rates . I would recommend solely based on location to Navy Pier , Michigan Avenue , Millennium Park and the Loop . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ##dea ##lly located with imp ##ec ##ca ##ble attention to detail and hospitality . Having spent a few weekends away with my wife at this hotel now , this is the hotel we measure all others against . I recommend s ##p ##lu ##rg ##ing on the Mediterranean Suite and join their visitors club for per ##ks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency is a er ##y nice hotel that is central ##ly located . Love ##ly views , helpful staff , comfortable , spacious room with good work space and nice amenities . There are many good restaurants and lots of shopping within walking distance of the H ##ya ##tt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 3 nights during a conference , paying about $ 300 per night for a large room on the executive 23rd floor . Aside from the r ##uck ##us outside from the striker ##s , I didn ' t notice much impact , but then I ' m low maintenance in general . Most other hotels were facing the same strike . The hotel has lots of history and character , but the room was recently renovated and comfortable . Location was good , you can easily walk to most attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is absolutely stunning ! It ' s a se ##rene and absolutely clean locality , with Lake Michigan at a stone ' s throw . Con ##ven ##ient to get taxi ##s there . It ' s an old , but well maintained building . Room ##s are moderate in size , but comfortable . Would like to stay there again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el Chicago is definitely a must try when you are in the area . With great service , beautiful clean rooms , top notch bed ##ding , and most importantly delicious food and cocktail ##s . The location is close to many restaurants and attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay at the Hilton thoroughly . The hotel spaces are beautiful , the location is within walking distance of some great food . The staff was extremely consider ##ate and helpful , particularly a gentleman with a memorable and unusual name , Do ##y Gil ##dar ##t who helped me en ##roll in a beneficial points program Hilton Plus . Overall it was a great experience and accommodation ##s during the conference was home away from home . P ##lent ##y of no ##ok ##s to slip into and get some work done and / or lots of social spaces . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is very good with Michigan Ave , Rush Street and Navy Pier all within walking distance . The hotel is an older hotel but the rooms have been updated . The lobby area could use an update but nothing bad to speak of . The staff are all a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I used the con ##cier ##ge service for multiple dining recommendations and they were all spot on . My only criticism is that they still want $ 10 + dollars for daily w ##if ##i access ( free access is available in the lobby ) . In this day and age and at this price point , free w ##if ##i in rooms should be available . It certainly can be go ##vere ##ned to prevent internet streaming . All in all though a pleasant stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hi tech rooms with beautiful cabinets , awesome shower , flu ##ffy towels , N ##es ##press ##o machine and lo ##ung ##ing sofa . Love ##ly experience : ) . Looking forward to returning for my next business meeting held there in January 2019 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the reputation this hotel has the rooms were very dated . Wall ##paper hanging off the wall , no coffee pot or microwave in room . Couldn ' t even warm up hot water for an evening tea . When I asked to change room I was treated like what ' s wrong . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve never seen anything like it : $ 15 for a day ' s use of the fitness center $ $ for hotel guest w ##if ##i And even $ 3 to store my suitcase for a few hours while attending a conference at YOU ##R H ##OT ##EL ? Web ##site says 100 % non - smoking ; but there was a definite smell of smoke in my room . Nice , comfortable bed and pillows ; typical bathroom . Location is great - - lake is right there , and there ' s a Lou Mal ##nat ##i ' s right around the corner for some awesome Chicago - style pizza . G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s about 0 . 5 miles away . Pool has lap lanes and there ' s a small track around the fitness center ( maybe around 100 m per lap ? ) . It ' s free to use the pool and track but use of anything / everything else in the fitness center costs $ 15 / day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is well positioned to major attractions in the downtown area . The meetings I attended were crowded and many people had to stand at the various sessions . The services at the hotel are extensive but expensive . Park ##ing fees were very high and added significantly to overall cost of our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt is always a great place to stay . We stay every year for business and never have any concerns . We feel safe and comfortable and the location is very good for shut ##tling to convention center and for shopping and going out to eat . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Palmer house was a beautiful historic hotel in the heart of Chicago , we walked to watch Hamilton in another historic venue . You could easily u ##ber to all the sites near downtown or walk to any food you liked . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The views on the water are great ! We had the club rooms with the snack ##s and drinks included . I ' m not sure if it was worth the extra cost , but was convenient to have snack ##s and drinks available . It ' s a great hotel in a great location . I would definitely stay there again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , Chicago ' s Gold Coast . Wonderful staff . A + for clean ##liness . Except ##ional ##ly professional , court ##eous & friendly upon check - in & check - out . Room size very very generous in size as was our bathroom . Bath ##room products were Jonathan Adler , great choice ! Pet friendly environment . [ Alt ##ho we didn ' t have our pets with us ] Overall great experience . Certainly would recommend The Talbot ##t [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment you walk in the H ##ya ##tt Regency on W ##ack ##er , you feel welcome . the staff is well trained and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , fast , efficient and always greeting you and offering to help you in any way you can . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel lobby and restaurant and bar areas are very nice . I was disappointed that my room looked dark and seriously in need of up ##dating . I ' m not sure i will be staying here again 7 ##n ##less the rooms have been red ##one . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Beautiful hotel ! Friendly , helpful , professional staff . They checked on our arrival time to make sure they were ready for our check in . They checked on us during the stay and asked if all was going to plan and followed up after stay to make sure they met our needs . Clearly , they wanted us to be satisfied and gave us no excuses not to be ! Room was spacious and taste ##fully decorated . In the heart of downtown Chicago . Lots of restaurants , shopping and parks within walking distance . We had a great twenty four hour experience and I would stay there again if we get back to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had stayed here before and were looking forward to another great experience . However , we paid extra for " Lake view " and were given a room with one out of 3 windows where you could see the lake if you leaned right into it . The other 3 windows were a brick wall . It had 2 bathroom ##s . One with minimal towels ( no bath mat and 1 lonely towel ) . The toilet had a p ##eg flush like a look ##er room . A disappointing experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lounge staff was efficient , & made the experience very pleasant . The app ##eti ##zers were ta ##sty , and re ##ple ##nish ##ed frequently . We used a room down the hall for a painting party . The staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . It was a great experience ! I would bring my husband back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love this hotel ! I booked it at the last minute because I needed to stay somewhere downtown , so I didn ' t get to research this place before staying but I was very pleasant ##ly impressed . The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was nice and clean . I requested a room with a city view and that was nice , free continental breakfast on our floor was a great touch . The staff was super friendly and a ##cco ##mo ##dating and that was much appreciated . The Ki ##nz ##ie has quickly become one of my favorite downtown hotels ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our group arrived early and the hotel ' s staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Super ##b customer service by Michael at the front desk ! Great location , great rooms and great Happy Hour and Breakfast . Will stay here again next time I go to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is Located near the southern end of Grant Park just north of the Field museum and the Planet ##arium . It ’ s an ups ##cale , newly re ##mo ##del ##ed hotel . It ’ s a few blocks from the closest E ##L ( train ) station and small walk to the Loop , or central downtown . We enjoyed walking to things . The hotel itself is quiet , comfortable , a good restaurant , and a public Irish bar . So what more could you want ? En ##joy your stay in the Wind ##y City ( called that because of its politicians talking so much not the actual wind ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having stayed at the Kim ##pton ' s Hotel Monaco in San Fr ##an , I knew what to expect here : good service , free fl ##av ##our ##ed water , wine tasting ##s in the evening and comfortable rooms . And that we got : a plus ##h , comfortable bed to retreat to after taking in Chicago ( which my travel companion and I enjoyed ) . Great views of Marina City and the river from " River ##view Room ##s . " I would upgrade , otherwise you ' ll be looking out into an alley , which is much less attractive . While the overall experience with this hotel is positive , I rated the hotel poor on service given how we were treated when a personal item went missing from our room . Train ##ed hotel staff should know better than to treat their customers in the manner in which we were treated and I don ' t need to get into it any more than that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I absolutely loved my stay here at the Conrad . The food , the service , and the atmosphere were definitely something special and unique . The room itself had a spectacular view of Michigan a ##ve and had a welcoming feel to it , despite the automatic shades and the massive modern flats ##cre ##en t ##v . I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Chicago who want a cater ##ed experience without being too over ##be ##aring . The Baptiste & Bo ##ttle on the 20th floor had exceptional food and amazing cocktail ##s , convenient ##ly right next to the lobby , giving you a place to relax before heading to your room . My girlfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I were in Chicago for a business meeting . Our experience with the Swiss ##ote ##l was very pleasant , beginning with the front desk . We arrived before the usual check - in time , but we only had a brief wait before they texted us that a room was ready . The room was clean , quiet and very comfortable . The cost of the room was reasonable , given the location . We had only a short walk to Michigan Ave , many restaurants , shopping and the Art Institute . There were no difficulties with transportation , either . Our first visit won ' t be our last . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our 4th time staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie . We love it ! The staff is very friendly and helpful . Melissa Dr ##iza the is wonderful ! Very at ##ten ##tive to our needs and made this stay extract special . We love the location of this hotel and the little extra ##s that make this hotel so inviting ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were staying 3 nights with teenagers and had never booked a suite before . We stayed in one of the amazing suites and it was perfect . It was like having a spacious living area completely separate from the sleeping area . Best part , there were 2 bathroom ##s ! I cannot say enough about this hotel and staff . I do not have a single complaint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Conrad on a snow ##y trip to Chicago recently . The room was amazing . To ##ns of unique things that differentiate the Conrad brand from other Hilton properties . House ##keeping is phenomena ##l and goes the extra mile . The lobby isn ’ t in the main floor so it is nice that you can simply get in the elevator and head to your room without a lot of f ##uss . The food at the restaurant was also delicious at dinner time . One of the best b ##urger ##s I have ever eaten . Breakfast was not nearly as good . One item to note is that the room was incredibly quiet for a downtown hotel . Almost silent . I will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bed and furnishings in the room were fine , but the bathroom is far from adequate . There is only on hook on which to hang any garments you wish to have with you . There is only one towel bar that could hold at most one bath towel and one hand towel . There is no grab bar in the shower except for the shower door handle . The shower head is in the ceiling rather than on the wall making it difficult to get well r ##ins ##ed . There is also a hard shower , which is essential . Use it rather that the ceiling fixture . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful and the location is fantastic . It is close to millennium park and navy pier as well as many stores and restaurants . The staff is very friendly . Joshua at reception was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful during our stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had a great visit to Chicago staying a the Hilton . Cars ##arra H at the Front Des ##k was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting for my stay . Had a very nice room with a lake view . Several restaurants on site for business travelers . Would definitely come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Miss the hotel ' s old , traditional look , but the new , sleek , up - scale appearance is growing on us . Many faces stayed the same through the change . D ##wayne is the best ! Charles is wonderful ! Perry , Gene and Tim , too , are just like old friends . They have made our stays over the years very special - just like coming home ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Many historic hotels are being renovated , and right ##fully so . The Palmer House still looks as must have during its hey day , but with modern convenience ##s . It is within blocks of the blue line and the loop lines , walking distance of Millennium Park , the Art Institute , the theaters , and many places to eat and shop . The service is top - notch . We stayed in a lovely room which , unfortunately , was behind the elevators . We used digital check in and check out , and enjoyed a sample of the Honey Ginger Mar ##gar ##ita . Del ##icious ! The con ##cier ##ge offered us compliment ##ary tickets to Hamilton that another guest had for ##feit ##ed ; we declined because we had just seen the show so some lucky person got to go ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 5 nights there last week . We have two small kids and we like the 1 ##K suite and the kids sleep on the pull ##out couch . We chose the 19th floor , which was the same floor as the pool and worked out well for us . There are only two elevators , which make for slow going every now and then . Also , breakfast is a MA ##D H ##O ##US ##E . We are partial to Home ##wood Suite ##s and have always found that they have good quality breakfast ##s , but the quantity they are ch ##urning just makes that hard . They can barely keep up with the hungry ho ##ards . I really appreciated the proximity to both the Red Line and Michigan Avenue . Also close to Jewel O ##sco and Trade ##r Joe ##s if you need g ##ro ##cer ##ies to avoid eating out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was great ! I stayed here Mother ' s Day weekend with my mom as a mother / daughter trip . We didn ' t do the upgrade so unfortunately we did not have w ##if ##i but that was fine . This hotel is in a great location ! Our room was pretty nice too and I had a great sleep . We walked for 10 hours one day and I slept for 11 hours ! I didn ' t hear any noise and the room was quiet . I also stayed at a Mar ##riot ##t the weekend before in Toronto and the room in Chicago was twice the size which I was not expecting ! The service was also excellent for checking in and out . They also made last minute reservations for us and recommend a great place to eat which we appreciated . I would certainly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel - right on River . Short walk to Navy Pier ( 15 - 20 min ##s ) , Michigan Ave ( 5 min ##s ) and access back into the loop and a " Super W ##al ##green ##s - two floors with everything you could ever need , including alcohol . Staff really friendly , they have bikes you can use to tour the city . The room was really nice , all the windows have pads in them so you can lay in them and watch everything happening below - the room has a bout ##ique feel to it . I would use this room again for a special occasion ( it was our anniversary ) , but if it was just a general stay I ' d look to a less upgraded room . Will stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I recently traveled to Chicago for an overnight and were looking for a mid - range hotel . We were very happy to find Ken ##zie Hotel and were pleased with our stay . The hotel and rooms are updated with a very sleek , clean feel . The location is great , close to the L and shopping / dining . We were given token ##s for cocktail ##s during happy hour in their hospitality room located on the top floor and were told that included in the room price was a continental breakfast offered every morning on each floor . These are nice per ##ks . The staff was friendly , efficient and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I would stay definitely here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are tired and dark . Car ##pet f ##ray ##ed . Door ##men un ##friend ##ly , miserable , except Benjamin . Front Des ##k : mostly g ##rump ##y except for two people . Music in lobby in good . If you could just hang out here it would be okay . Otherwise , stay elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] N ##eat and clean rooms , pro ##mpt and at ##ten ##tive staff , will certainly recommend it to others . The rooms were clean , well maintained , visibly old but well maintained and looked like they aged graceful ##ly and weren ' t run down or falling apart . The over all feel of the hotel is that of an extremely warm Bo ##uti ##que hotel , I ' ll be back for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was fine . Staff were nice . Even though masks were supposedly required , it was not enforced . Staff wore them but guests did not and were not asked to when they were n the lobby . Nice to have a kitchen ##ette . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great hotel with wonderful staff and steps away from theaters . Was also the best value in the area . Con ##ven ##ient self park across the street . Clean and comfortable rooms and a Happy Hour at 5 in the lobby with compliment ##ary Pro ##se ##co . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Fantastic view of fireworks display at Navy Pier . This was an overnight s ##p ##lu ##rge to celebrate New Year ' s and we were not disappointed . We plan to come back to celebrate our wedding anniversary in the summer this year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment Eric took our bags at door until we departed we were taking care of with great ease . Bernard the con ##cier ##ge answered our questions about restaurants . The suite on the 36 floor was stunning . The best views in Chicago over the river and the lake . I wish I could remember the names of all that staff that helped us . I am looking forward to our next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything there was superior to our expectations . The stuff was great , the hotel clean and quiet , but the biggest surprise was our suite . St ##un ##ning city view , big rooms , full equipped and overall a place to feel like home ! ! ! The breakfast was rich and ta ##sty , without remarkable changes from day to day , and was offering enough choices for light food free of fat or with low ca ##lor ##ies . T ##H ##IS IS A H ##OT ##EL ID ##EA ##L F ##OR FA ##MI ##L ##IE ##S . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room I sat ##yed in had a nice river view , but during my stay the construction noise from the opposite river side disturbed me , especially on Saturday morning . The doors to the corridor are every ##the ##n else than no ##is proof and due to some reunion events over the weekend it was very noisy , even in the late evening . The carpet ##s in the rooms are worn out and no longer fashionable : They should be replaced by wooden panels . On the p ##os ##ive side , staff was very helpful and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago is a beautiful hotel in a great location . Right on the river and 1 / 2 block from Michigan Ave . Location worked perfect to see the city . The lobby bar was exceptional as well ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am currently staying at the Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro and will be staying another night . The foyer is beautiful , the location is central ##ly based and just a short walk to the river and many corporate offices , and nice interior to the rooms ( despite their slightly small size ) . The hotel is clean , and for the most part , equipped with amenities that every business travel ##er would want . My concern with this hotel is that the walls are paper thin : you can hear everything happening outside of your room and in each of you neighbour ' s bedrooms . Upon requesting to guest services whether they could do anything to accommodate my request they said all they could do would be to give ear ##p ##lug ##s . . . For this reason , unfortunately , I will not be returning after this trip . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This Ki ##nz ##ie hotel smells so clean . All facilities and appliances looked new and functioned excellent . All staff members were me ##mor ##ably kind . En ##joy ##ed compliment ##ary breakfast . Had to be back home after staying 4 nights there , but wish we could stay much longer . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is unique and historic . While the rooms are updated and modern ( im ##ma ##culate and well appointed ) , the public areas of the hotel are amazing ##ly true to their original look and feel , like a step back in time . The beautiful indoor pool area is like no other . The hotel offers many other amenities , and a very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Knowledge ##able so ##mme ##liers were on hand in the wine and dessert bar to answer questions and provide suggestions . While there , we were introduced to enjoyable new wine ideas . All this plus a location convenient to unlimited shopping and restaurant offerings . Our stay here was a real weekend treat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 2 of our mornings we had breakfast outside , service was terribly long the 2 older men con ##cier ##ge are very unpleasant , they make you feel you are bothering them when you ask a question the lady that did my check out was [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is nice , in a great location and the staff were helpful . Our room was big , nice and updated but the lighting was a bit lacking . In the bathroom ceiling there were two can lights that didn ’ t turn on with the switch so we were limited to the mirror lights . The work - out facilities and pool were very nice and the on - site restaurant was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting with good food . On - site parking under the hotel helped as well . We were in the “ executive ” tower but our son got a room in the other tower which wasn ’ t as big or nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed here one night when going to a show at the Chicago Theater . It is a perfect location for that . The theater is a block away . Everything about this place was great . The staff at check in made you feel at home . The v ##alet was great . There is wine for an hour at 5 which was perfect . When i mentioned we were going to eat at a place across the street the girl gave us a free app ##eti ##zer card . The only downfall was the fact the bed was a bit uncomfortable and the pillows offer no support . We stayed due to the great price because of the restaurant being closed for re ##ne ##vations . Not sure if we would stay again at full price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel should be at the top of your list for Chicago . It is * lovely . * From the imp ##ec ##ca ##ble friendly service when you walk in to the rooms which are updated , with high ceilings , lovely amenities , lush beds . It is really luxurious - a five star experience . Also the price of the rooms is very reasonable for the quality of the hotel . I stay here whenever I can . I also din ##ed in the restaurant - the service there can vary . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We travelled to Chicago with business partners but brought our families along . The rooms and beds were comfortable , clean and well cared for . The hotel was gorgeous and convenient location suitable for walking to dinner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for a wedding and this was the ' host hotel ' . The accommodation ##s were magnificent , the staff was extremely helpful ( front desk , con ##cier ##ge , etc . ) and the location was perfect for shopping , dining and sights ##ee ##ing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We checked out several Hilton group hotels before deciding to go for Home ##wood . Being a Hilton regular , we knew what to expect . The room ( s ) is ( are ) spacious and everything was nice and clean , as could be expected after a renovation . W ##if ##i does not work well from all places in the room except from the kitchen area but the link also tends to drop in this area . I was told there gonna be some modifications next year . W ##if ##i is good in the reception / food area . Card reader in the elevator is not needed to get to the room floors . Not sure what the slot is good for . If you do self - parking , you may reduce your expenses . The location is convenient for easy access to Navy Pier , food places and Grant Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this property ! The Library has great coffee and breakfast ##s . Custom ##er service was top notch . B ##re & Sami were so helpful during my stay and while checking out . It was a rainy weekend and they have umbrella ##s for their guests ! So thankful ! Great location to be close to everything while being in a quiet neighborhood . Look forward to returning ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the first greeting to the last goodbye it was f ##abulous . D ##wayne is exceptional , though in truth they all are . Gene on the con ##cier ##ge desk and the front of house staff , the restaurant team . . . everyone . A really friendly and welcoming hotel in a wonderful city . Room ##s are very comfortable and pretty quiet . The location in the Near North is also convenient with the subway three blocks away . Made for a great stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel lived up to my expectations . Clean , great service , good rooms and food . The location was fantastic although would have preferred a room on a higher floor to have less street noise . The food provided during the conference was very good - probably the best I ' ve had at a conference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time staying at the Hotel All ##egro since it was taken over and totally re ##mo ##del ##ed by Kim ##pt ##om . Over ##sal ##l , now is my go to hotel in Downtown Chicago and their Kim ##pt ##om Ka ##rma program has me looking into staying at other Kim ##pt ##om chains for business travel . Room was described as " small " on other Trip Advisor reviews , but very intelligent design made it feel begged than rooms at other hotels claiming rooms almost twice as large . Only disappointing in - room experience was slow ##ness and difficulty of using in room W ##i ##F ##i . However , placement of multi - plug charging stations on either side of bed eliminated having to search behind bed and in corners for available plug ##s for re ##cha ##rg ##ing my iPhone and I pad . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed a 6 night break here . We opted for the upgrade to the club level and enjoyed the con ##tin ##ten ##tal breakfast ##s and free soft drinks which was very helpful with a busy schedule . One of our rooms was next to the lift shaft and I could hear the bell / pin ##g from our room as the lifts arrived and left . The sound proof ##ing between the room and the corridors could have been better . The staff were friendly and we felt at home in this hotel . Shu ##la ' s steak restaurant was a special evening and the b ##urger bar at river level was also very good . The key cards to the room often fail ( something to do with keeping them next to a mobile device ) and the que ##ues for reception could be long at times . Overall an enjoyable stay in a comfortable , home ##ly hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful . . . fast check in . . . fast check ##out . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds . Super clean . Easy to locate . Con : Ex ##pen ##sive parking charges . . . we did U ##BE ##R . . . L ##OL 10 minutes parking @ door ##man post . Historical property . Bell ##man . . . Con ##s ##cier ##e Service . . . Door ##man . . . come dressed to impress . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for a conference , but would stay again for pleasure . The location is perfect for sights ##ee ##ing in Chicago . My room had beautiful views of the lake and city . River ##walk is across the street . Food and shopping nearby as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel in a great location . The service was fantastic , the room was quiet , ch ##ic and functional for business needs . The bed was very comfortable and I enjoyed my stay so much that I would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the brand , but this location did not fit my desires . Location would have been great had my family been with me , but being a solo trip , would have preferred a less crowded , quiet ##er stay . The West Loop / Jefferson street location is more geared towards business travel as opposed to family out ##ings . But as usual , staff in dining area was top notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable hotel , good surroundings , nice fitness and del ##ica ##cies for breakfast . Cal ##m and spacious room , l ##ux ##uries amenities . Very nice view over the city , lots of light . Service is very helpful , night and day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I come here every April For a large national conference , and always stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l , even though the conference takes place at the H ##ya ##tt . The Swiss ##ote ##l is staffed with well - trained , quality people who are most polite . Room ##s are im ##ma ##culate ##ly clean , and the facility beautifully maintained . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the neighborhood and proximity to so many things . A long time ago , I lived in this neighborhood and it was a pleasure to be at such a nice hotel in the Gold Coast . The P ##ump room is really beautiful . High ##ly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] A comfortable , very well run and friendly hotel . There was a sense of being valued and respected as a customer . The breakfast was well presented and ta ##sty , and the room was really well furnished and the bathroom was exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , walking distance to Lake Michigan and many many restaurants and shopping . Everyone was very friendly , very helpful . The too was super comfortable . Very clean . The carpet was plus ##h and luxurious under my feet . Very relaxing and pleasant . I liked the low beds but might be difficult for someone who is older . [SEP]
0	[CLS] All good at the H ##ya ##tt Regency on W ##ack ##er Drive in Chicago as usual . Close to everything and easy to access transportation , shopping and entertainment . It ' s one of my favorite H ##ya ##tt destinations that welcome ##s me back each time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Old facility , limited space , few amenities available . No good choice for dining in . Location is great - next to river ##walk , restaurants , shopping . Do not plan to drive - construction plus awful traffic , expensive difficult parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel . . . we loved having two adjoining suites for our group of 6 . Location is great ; all staff were very welcoming and always so helpful . The room service disc ##ards in the hallway ##s seemed to stick around longer than ideal . El ##eva ##tors pose a bit of a n ##ui ##sance as you need to get to third floor only to transfer to another bank of elevators for floor access . Bit loud at night . . . lots of sire ##ns I guess heading to hospital . But this aside , a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The ##rm ##ost ##at was broken , bath ##tub was dirty , had an issue with the t ##v only getting one channel . Called the front desk and they could not have possibly cared less . I would have expected that from a 2 star hotel , but at this level , service is the name of the game and they don ’ t even try . Stay at a Mar ##riot ##t or a Hilton - your money will be better spent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got a wonderful deal for this 2 - room suite that was located 3 blocks from the river and close to great restaurants . Staff was always friendly and helpful ; compliment ##ary hot breakfast and happy hour made it an even better deal ! We ' ve stayed in 2 different Chicago Home ##wood Suite ##s , and will probably do so again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The facility was nice , but it was not very comfortable because of the crowds . We brought our 2 young children and it was difficult to maneuver through the food area for the evening social and breakfast time . There were not enough tables , so we had to bring our food back to our room . We also had to wait for several full elevators to fit our family into one . The pool was also very crowded in the evening , making it less enjoyable . Our room was hot as was the lobby . Overall , not a very comfortable or relaxing stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location between North River ##front and Michigan Ave . Small but comfortable lobby , nice rooms and the restaurant is good for breakfast . If you are a Kim ##pton point member and book through another booking site you might not get your points , so call them direct and ask for the same price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The customer service that began at the front door th ##ru check in and dining areas were exceptional . Hotel costs under $ 200 with luxury attention . It was the perfect location for downtown access to restaurants and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location lovely lobby and bar . . . rooms slightly dated but clean and comfortable . Initially put in a room next to lifts really noisy the whole of the night ! Ask ##ed to be moved and was helpful . . . . did actually say they are aware of the noisy rooms but still put people in them ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I typically love the Swiss and have stayed there a number of times . The location is great for me . Unfortunately my room request was ignored and I ended up with a de ##pressing room . I have always told people that the Swiss is my automatic choice because it is bliss ##fully clean . Sad ##ly , house ##keeping was very sub - par this year . The bar staff was great - as always . I am going to re - evaluate my choice next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful location and lovely size rooms ( Superior King Room ) . Great staff going above and beyond normal course of duty . Extreme ##ly helpful with all requests and in particular Je ##rm ##el - you definitely saved the day . Thanks a million . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although the room was just a ta ##d larger than a closet , the location works great for the theater district . A short walk from the South Shore train station at Millennium Park . Just be ready to pack the plastic . A wine and a s ##cot ##ch was $ 23 at their very ordinary , but convenient bar . Coffee bar in the morning was very appreciated , and check out , luggage storing , and employees were outstanding . Did not drive , so no clue on the garage situation . Next door to The Palace Theatre . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of the best hotel experiences I have ever had . Staff amazing ##ly helpful and food surprisingly good . for a hotel . Facility clean and quiet . Service right on . Location great for Chicago experience but try not to arrive at the airport during rush hours . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay at the Talbot was very nice . Had ##n ' t been there in 20 ##yr ##s + Staff was friendly and genuine . The room & de ##cor was clean and spacious . Bar staff , was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . . I will definitely return again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel is quite good . Location great , but watch your bill at all times . They seem to charge you for drinks you don ’ t have because there system of knowing who is buying the drinks is very poor . Also they will put money on hold on your credit card every day for a room charge even if you have paid the room in advance . So you may over spend on your card thinking you have money there and them be charged by your bank while waiting for the money to be re ##fu ##nded by the Hotel . Which they shouldn ’ t of touched in the first place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The noise level ( floor 5 ) was too much every am at 4 am we were awake w the sounds of bee ##ps and garbage collection . Our bathroom was ok but final check should have been done as we had hair in the tub . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay was less than 24 hours . However the hotel was nice . Quick ##est check in and check out process I have ever experienced . Room ##s were on the smaller side but nice and clean . Staff was very cord ##ial and helpful . Location was prime for my visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Long weekend in Chicago . Pick ##ed the Conrad . No regret ##s ! Large corner room on 15th floor with floor to ceiling glass windows with power shades and d ##rap ##es . To ##ns of closet space . Hu ##ge flat screen TV . Large bathroom with enormous shower . Hotel provides tons of bottle ##d water . N ##es ##press ##o machine and small refrigerator in room . Very clean and spacious . Great location . Em ##p ##loy ##ees are very friendly and helpful . Even provide guests with umbrella ##s if it is rain ##ing ! Would definitely recommend and stay there again ! R ##oof ##top bar was closed for winter so I guess I need to go back when it ' s warmer ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The carpet on the stairs in the event area has worn through . The phone in my room didn ' t work . Room service came to my room twice with the same order - I had to turn the second guy away . The hotel isn ' t quite what I remember it . Has lost some of its charm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were modern , quiet , high - quality and exceeded my expectations . And , as a bonus , a te ##rri ##fic shower . The location was about perfect . Lots of options for eating and shopping . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] How lucky to have found the Ki ##nz ##ie . Fantastic in every way ~ from pulling in to the front of the hotel for v ##alet parking , through check - in , arrival in lovely room , fun happy hour , great breakfast selections , and quick and efficient check out . Found no complaints ; only delight ##s . Kathryn Colbert , sales manager , A + ; front desk personal ( ? Lexi ##s ) , A + ; door ##man A + . Great place . Great location . Very clean , quiet . Will stay there from now on when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay . The staff in every de ##pt was friendly , helpful and efficient . The family loved the 19th floor pool with a beautiful sky ##line view of the city . Breakfast was always well maintained by a watch ##ful staff . Fresh fruit , yo ##gu ##rt and g ##rano ##la became a favorite . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is not my first stay at the Hotel Monaco and it will not be my last . The team truly makes you feel welcomed and like part of their family . Our room was clean , beautiful and had an amazing view . Thanks Hotel Monaco for another amazing stay ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My experience was great the breakfast and evening social were wonderful on the incredibly cold days when I didn ' t want to leave . The staff had great flexibility as my plans changed with the weather and I had to come in early and leave late . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel by far met our needs ! They accommodate ##d our want for a top floor hotel on the spot , the room was comfortable and big . The hotel was amazing , and staff was willing to go above and beyond ! We got to the pool late and she extended our swimming time — hotel was also nice & quiet . The only small “ bad ” thing I noticed was the elevators are in bad shape , no reason to not stay , but just be aware that they are quite shaky & loud while inside . Thank you for our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got an amazing deal on Price ##line , read the reviews on ye ##l ##p . Most of them had bad reasons I was going in a little worried . My husband & I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for a couple of days for a business meeting & that hotel was small & needed to be re ##mo ##del ##ed . When we checked in our room at the Swiss ##ô ##tel we were amazed . The room was very modern , a lot of room & a comfortable bed . Staff is super friendly , especially Ken ##nan so helpful & very customer service oriented . De ##fin ##ite ##ly going to make this hotel our go to next time we come to visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The place , service amazing . Will recommend to family and friends . Excellent breakfast and the venue was incredibly awesome . From the ceremony to the cocktail hour to the reception incredible . T ##iara and Heather were the best wedding coordinator . S ##hout out to them they did an amazing job . Thanks to them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I looked at many hotels before deciding on Hotel Monaco and could not have been more pleased ! Everything was just right : the staff , the lobby and wine hour , the room , the robes , the amenities - and the location was un ##beat ##able ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had our wedding at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker on June 15th . Our experience was far more wonderful than we could have ever expected . Austin West , our wedding coordinator was amazing . He was on spot and over the top with every aspect of our day . He thought of things that we never even thought of and made our day amazing and absolutely un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble . I would recommend this venue ( Austin ) and of course this hotel to anyone for any type of venue . Our guests are still r ##aving about the amazing night ! Thank you Austin , and the staff at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for making it an un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble experience . We will be back and so will our guests ! Amazing ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the friendly wonderful staff to the wonderful welcome note in our room , this has made me a repeat customer ! The room was spacious and beautiful . The window seat was a great place to read and enjoy the view . Can ##not wait to come back [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a small conference and was completely charm ##ed by the clean ##liness , the rooms , the five - star dining , the lobby , the roof - top reception room , and the friendly & helpful staff . The Ambassador is one of those quiet l ##ux ##uries providing a re ##f ##reshing re ##sp ##ite in the midst of a bust ##ling city . A range of affordable to higher end dining for food ##ies are in easy walking distance ( but don ' t forget Booth One off the first floor lobby ) . I came for business , but I ' ll be back for pleasure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We traveled to All ##egro Chicago earlier this week for business . The lovely building boasts art de ##co architecture and details , clean , comfortable rooms , and outstanding service . We would like to give special thanks to the security department who helped us to resolve some issues ( not related to the hotel ) with incoming business materials . They went out of their way to provide an excellence of service that is rarely seen . Ku ##dos ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location to all of the downtown things to do . Easy walk to both River ##walk and John Hancock . The hotel staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We had a mechanical problem with the blind ##s and they fixed it while we were at dinner . We will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel with good staff . Good value for the cost . Great downtown location right across from the river . Walking distance to many restaurants and bars . Close to theatres and mass transit . We stayed in room 111 ##2 with a window seat and view of the river . I would definitely stay in this room again . Staff made good recommendations for activities and restaurants . Nice wine happy hour every day during our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This used to be nice . But the rooms are tired and I ’ ll kept . Peel ##ing wall ##paper . Mo ##ld ##y shower tiles . Missing knob ##s . It ’ s a bad roads ##ide motel . Whatever g ##lam ##or it has left long ago . I ’ ve stayed in better places in Chicago . It ’ s not hard . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel probably couldn ' t be better located , comfortable room with fantastic views ! But what made my stay stand out was the hospitality from Connie in the 33rd Floor Club Lounge ! She made it feel like home , continually checking - in on me and my needs ! Thank you Connie ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] great stay , great location . The rooms were comfortable and large . The bed and sheets felt clean . The shower flow of the water felt great . The bar service and app ##eti ##zers were good and the wait staff friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 5 nights during July 4th - picked the perfect place to stay here . Not 1st time to Chicago , but 1st time to stay at the So ##fit ##el . I ##dea ##l location - close to the waterfront & everything you want to see + do downtown . We went to W ##rig ##ley a few times for concerts & ball ##game - was such easy access to get there from the red line . The hotel itself is just lovely w / French influences throughout . Room ##s are ultra comfortable , im ##ma ##culate ##ly clean w / plus ##h furnishings , very spacious bathroom ##s , good closet space w / shelves , huge windows w / great city views . Staff are very pleasant , professional & helpful . My husband & I both love the So ##fit ##el & will def stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you want to stay at a hotel that is bust ##ling with rest ##ua ##rants , bars , and rooms with a view , the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago is your place . I had a double room that was very comfortable . Pa ##id the extra fee for a high room and had a nice view of the Chicago River . Easy walking distance to rest ##ura ##nts and shopping . The desk staff and con ##cier ##ge service was very a ##com ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The atmosphere was welcoming and custom ##ized to each guest . Staff were extremely helpful and kind . D ##wayne , Perry , D , Marc , and Charles went out of their way to provide excellent customer service . We will definitely be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our 1st time staying at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago . The location along the river was te ##rri ##fic . My husband ’ s conference was being held there which made it so convenient . We din ##ed at Shu ##las steak ##house which was delicious . I also had the b ##uff ##et breakfast every morning at L ##B B ##ist ##ro which started my days off perfectly before I headed to the museums . The room had a perfect view of the Chicago river especially at night when all the buildings spark ##led like stars . The room was average in size . It could have used a loves ##eat instead of one chair . We didn ’ t get the renovated room that I hoped for but the view made up for it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff was very at ##ten ##tive and friendly . We stayed for two nights and as luck would have it the elevator was down so we had to use the service elevators . I know it can happen but when you pay a lot for a room , you expect better things . The room was clean and comfortable but very small . The location is excellent for the shopping and dining and close proximity to the lake walking path . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My boyfriend and I enjoyed our 3 night stay at Hotel Monaco . The staff were all very pleasant - especially the door ##men - all super helpful and just really nice to talk to ! The bed was very comfortable and we were able to get a good nights sleep all three nights . The hotel also provided beverages throughout the day , which was nice to come back to after a day of walking around the city . The location was a big plus , we were able to walk to almost everywhere we wanted to go , or it was just a short cab drive away . Con ##s : The view in our room was of a brick wall , the t ##v was on the small side , you have to pay for internet if you are not a Kim ##pton rewards member , and the room service options were not great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] L ##O ##VE this hotel ! It ' s a g ##em - awesome location , com ##fy , modern , newly renovated , and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . My husband and I visited for a couple days to celebrate his birthday . It was a great time , everything was literally within walking distance . We will definitely be back to visit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located across Michigan Avenue . Next to the 360 Chicago observation deck in the iconic John Hancock Building . A great hotel with an excellent cost - benefit and an interesting location . A special thanks to the employee Craig . Very kind . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No ##is ##y neighbors in the room next to me . Ke ##pt me up all night coming in and out and letting the door bang as well as talking outside my door . The room doors were perpendicular to each other in a small hallway . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel the room was great / clean , nice view , but the only thing was that we had problems with the mobile key . Has a really nice bar , one if bartender was really nice to us that she made us a special Sang ##ria drink I love this bar I will definitely come back . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice location that is close to Michigan a ##ve shopping and downtown . Nice lake view . Service very professional . The de ##cor has been upgraded but a bit conservative looking . The lounge is nice but food is so so . . . 4 star overall but have to give 5 star since they gave me a sick suite upgrade [SEP]
1	[CLS] I always enjoy my stays at the Fair ##mont Millennium Park . The personal service in the 15th floor lounge is a real different ##iator . Having Man ##dan ##a greet me for breakfast each morning and anti ##ci ##pate everything from my coffee to newspaper and even setting me up where I like to sit while I brows ##e the b ##uff ##et , is a great start to each day . [SEP]
0	[CLS] i first stayed in H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago in 1981 and it has maintained its position as a world class property . The staff was exceptionally kind and helpful even for some strange requests i had . i enjoyed my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a nice property located just near Mill ##eni ##um Park in Downtown Chicago . I had a corner room on the 21st floor ( Room 210 ##6 I think ) which gave me a pretty nice view of the park and downtown , to include the peak of the Trump Tower . I did breakfast downstairs in the little restaurant called the Columbus tap . It was OK , but a price ##y for what it was . The o ##mel ##et was decent , but $ 4 ##ea for an 8 . 5 ##oz Diet Coke ( aluminum bottle ) was a bit excessive . We did dinner at Mi ##che ##al Jordan ' s St ##eak ##house , which was an easy walk away . That was a bit better than the on - property offerings . Overall it was a decent place to stay on a business trip , but I don ' t think I would bring the family to this particular property . It just seemed a bit limited for them . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wonderful hotel and great location . The staff was very friendly and enthusiastic and knowledge ##able and helped in any way possible . Thanks for your welcoming presence and for helping us enjoy the first visit to your city . And the Cubs won ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] i have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and my entire family stays here any time they visit Chicago . I have always experienced the most ho ##sp ##ita ##ble staff of any hotel . Besides the wonderful location , history and hospitality I must give a special shout out to the reservation manager , Candace ! There was a s ##na ##fu with my reservation and Candace g ##rac ##iously re ##ct ##ified the problem quickly and effort ##lessly with the u ##t ##most professional ##ism . i will be back and look forward to my next visit . Thank you Candace : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for two days and i wish i had read the advice from others prior to picking this hotel . First night we knew our neighbors name they were very vocal while having sex . . . second day the neighbors alarm went off at 6 am waking us up . You truly felt as though the you were sharing same room . Be ##ware that del ##uxe room is a queen bed . The rooms are extremely to small . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very convenient location on Ma ##g . Mile and luxury amenities within the hotel . Hotel staff are friendly and make everyone feel welcomed during entire stay . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend to all travelers . This is the only hotel with staying at any budget . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was Clean . Charles the Door ##man was kind and caring . Sweet Man . Check in was easy and people were nice . Room ##s were clean . Bed ##s very comfortable . Bath ##rooms clean and good smelling s ##ham ##po ##o and condition ##er and cream . We really enjoyed our stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It is un ##fo ##rg ##ivable that in 2018 , the O ##m ##ni restaurant does not label for all ##er ##gy foods like nuts . Our daughter had a severe all ##ergic reaction after eating the ve ##gg ##ie ben ##edic ##t . Someone needs to tell the management to take responsibility for the health ( and lives ) of guests . While the reaction was severe , we did not end up in the ER which could easily have happened . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff were pleasant and cheerful , room was p ##rist ##ine and we had a great South view of Chicago . Baptiste and Bo ##ttle service was quite poor in the morning but evening was fine . Overall it was a good stay in great location just off the Mile with only a few minor issues . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved this hotel . Everybody who worked there was incredibly nice , from the maid ##s to the front desk to the bell hop ##s . The Superior Corner Suite was great , if a little awkward . There is a mini fridge , but it ' s filled with the mini bar . Not enough outlets . Overall a fantastic stay , great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean hotel . Central ##ly located to many things . Great neighborhood . Help ##ful con ##cier ##ge and front desk staff ! Con ##cier ##ge helped us get on some great tours of the city and recommended some great restaurants nearby ! Bell desk very helpful . It had started rain ##ing and they loaned us umbrella ##s to use during the day ! I ' d stay here again and highly recommend them ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel and staff are wonderful ! High ##ly recommend this hotel . Con ##ven ##ient to Michigan Avenue and many great restaurants . Will plan to stay s ##t the O ##m ##ni again . Close to Apple Store . Sa ##ks . N ##eim ##an Marcus . Ralph Lauren and R ##L Restaurant . Beautiful room and very quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in O ##m ##ni this last weekend because of the location . When we checked in the bathroom had issues then we got the room changed . Next morning we decided to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant . The sealed yo ##gh ##urt cup had fungus floating on top . Its just shows how they handle their food . When we spoke to the manager she just waived a child ' s meal for this . We spoke to the main manager on the reception and they did not care much too . The whole point is they don ' t care whatever happens . You got to pay the whole price for the fungus breakfast . Never going back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , updated rooms , very helpful staff , and good breakfast ! I was recommended to this hotel by a friend and would definitely stay here in the future . New ##ly re ##mo ##del ##ed and clean . Staff always friendly and smiling . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would stay here again - it is central ##ly located . Close to metro - shopping - theatre and restaurants . Great restaurant . So why the four ? A handle was missing off of the dresser , the shear ##s were thread ##bar ##e . Grant ##ed it has its s ##wan ##k . . . . but just needed some minor repairs . Clean and with a friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just spent 2 nights at this hotel , our first room we were given was 281 ##5 , after a 10 hour journey , I was exhausted and needed a nap before going out for dinner . I pulled the du ##vet back and the sheets were all c ##reased with pub ##ic hairs on them . So we had to pack up again and move room . No apology at the desk for the in ##con ##ven ##ience to us . We did participate in their green earth day and when we checked out there was no mention of a v ##ou ##cher . The hotel ad ##vert ##isers a hotel pool , firstly it had a function on till 5 ##pm then it was under renovation . If we wanted to use a pool it is 2 blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location downtown classic reputation but has kept up with the times . Lo ##bby is large , visually appealing , ample seating areas just in front of entrances behind open contemporary screen . Lo ##bby bar central and popular meeting place . Room ##s are fair size , soothing be ##ige walls , muted earth tone carpet , white and oak modern furniture and white trim wood ##work . All amenities including fully stock ##ed mini - bar , coffee , etc . Bath ##room has shower and tub , com ##mo ##de in private enclosed space , additional dressing table outside of bathroom . Matt ##resses are over 12 " deep and comfortable but pillows are overly soft multiple " marsh ##mal ##lows . " G ##lim ##pse ##s of Lake Michigan between high rise office and con ##do buildings only . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying at the Palmer House . Great neighborhood & great location just off State Street in the heart of downtown Chicago . Great shopping nearby . Older property with modern amenities . Only down ##er was no indoor pool until Spring as it is currently being re ##mo ##del ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about this hotel is amazing . The room had two big soft beds , with lovely du ##vet and pillow . The room was large and clean and had good air conditioning . The bathroom was also big and nice . The staff at the hotel were kind and helpful and always seemed happy . Re ##com ##men ##d the breakfast . The coffee was also very good . The hotel is also very central in a co ##zy street with quite little traffic in relation to how central it was . Short walk to the beach , shopping and 360 Chicago observation deck . High ##ly recommended . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved the hotel . The location is great for a walk by the lake and the view from my room was worth all the money . The room and bed were very comfortable and the staff were very friendly . Thank you H ##ya ##tt for making me love Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker has a great location just a short walk off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and our room came in about a $ 100 per night less than neighboring hotels . When you see a lower rate on an older hotel you wonder if it is not kept up , but the room , while small , had a modern bathroom . The old elevators were a ho ##ot , the lobby was fine , the staff seemed friendly . Only draw ##back is that one of the news networks didn ' t have a picture , while all the other stations did . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff should be trained more efficiently to understand the guests . Its act like robots without thinking . One reception ##ist asked me for my passport and then went straight to check if I had a US VI ##SA as if that was his business . Also , we wanted to try the brown ##ie but the waiter ##s just ignored us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie hotel is a great hotel . Great atmosphere when you walk in . Re ##mind ##s me a little of a bout ##ique - y feel but still modern . The bar on the 6th floor with free drinks and food each night from 5 - 8 was so much fun and the perfect way to start your night . Our group took full advantage . The staff were very helpful . Breakfast was included with our stay . They had it on each level which was very convenient . The breakfast could have included a toast ##er for your bag ##els / toast and also cold water - other than that it was fine and not to have to worry about planning 3 meals a day was nice . The hotel rooms were very cool , clean and modern and each had a nice view . Overall I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was very large so give yourself enough time to get around if you are on a tight time - schedule . Hotel has many indoor amenities including access to parking garage ##s which was helpful in February in Chicago . There are business services as well as a Du ##nk ##in Don ##uts attached to the hotel , again , with access from inside . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d my stay . Very comfortable bed . The restaurant was great for breakfast . Staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and helpful . Bath ##rooms were large and accessible . I do not care for the doors on the bathroom , however , they are just rather weird . I do love that the lights come on automatically in the closet when you open the doors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room , friendly helpful staff and a great location . Quiet yet close to everything . Classic style hotel . My early 30 something nephew lives in Chicago and he said " Cool " when I told him where we were staying . His significant other used to live near there and they went there for drinks at the small bar off of the lobby and loved it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : downtown location . Friendly . Con ##s : in ##com ##pet ##ent staff ( I asked for a king room that is quiet , no view needed , but apparently , right above the El is considered a good room ) . No ##is ##y . Room ##s are super worn out , must ##y and unpleasant . Tiny bathroom ##s . No water pressure . No food . N ##ei ##gh ##bor ##hood might as well be a dem ##ili ##tar ##ized zone Do t stay here . Stay somewhere else [SEP]
0	[CLS] The rooms where great service was outstanding . My Family enjoy our mini vacation . We will come back . Very helpful with plans for the kids . The pool was nice Hood time had by all . You have to try it for you ' re self . thank you all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved the art - de ##co v ##ibe , and my room was small ( it ' s in the middle of a big city , so I expected that ) but spot ##lessly clean . Everyone was professional and friendly , from the desk staff to the con ##cier ##ge to the maintenance staff . Vale ##t parking is way over ##p ##rice ##d . Don ' t use it unless you really need it . There are garage ##s in the area . Walls are thin . If you are a very light sleep ##er , be fore ##war ##ned . [SEP]
0	[CLS] As a Hilton diamond member , anytime I can get a good corporate rate at a Conrad I ’ m going to grab it . I enjoyed my stay at this hotel . It ’ s close to my office and offers me luxury and service that other Hilton brands can ’ t provide . The room was spacious and full of amenities . I enjoyed the es ##press ##o machine . The gym is also very large and full of modern , clean equipment . I will be sure to book early to stay here often . I had a very pleasant stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Home ##wood Suite ##s is located one block west of Michigan Ave . It has one bedroom suites with kitchen ##ettes ( stove , fridge , microwave , dishes , silver ##ware , co ##rk screw , etc . ) . The staff is very helpful and polite , house keeping is great too . Free breakfast is offered in the morning with eggs , sa ##usage or bacon , bread ##s , past ##ries , fruit , yo ##gu ##rt , coffee , tea , juice ##s , etc . Star ##bu ##cks and P ##F Chang ' s is across the street and a Jewel O ##sco grocery is 2 blocks away along with a Trade ##r Joe ' s about 3 blocks away . Very convenient to the subway as well a block and a half away . Great location Great staff and easy access . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very modern outside but has a lot of personality inside and is decorated with particularly beautiful flower arrangements in the lobby . The geographical location is outstanding and staff was really friendly , especially a very polite con ##cier ##ge who helped me out at the reception , as almost all So ##fit ##el properties in the world , the hotel is ma ##gni ##fi ##que ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife surprised me with a 30th birthday weekend trip to Chicago . I had no idea where we were staying until we got to Public Chicago . She couldn ' t have picked a better place ! The staff was extremely friendly and Travis really made the stay worth it . Our room was decorated for the birthday festivities and was so much fun to walk into . Everything was very clean and orderly and we had no issues while being there . The area is extremely safe and convenient for transportation purposes . We will be back for sure and we would recommend this hotel to anyone that we know in a heartbeat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very g ##rac ##ious staff and cared about y your stay from time of arrival to departure . Very close walking distance to restaurants and lake Michigan . Would recommend the P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago whenever visiting downtown - Gold Coast area ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suite was very comfortable with nice amenities . There was a wet bar and large television ##s in the living room and bedroom . The bed was very comfortable with nice bed ##ding . Re ##quest an east facing room to have a view of Michigan Avenue . Turn down service is available and we had compliment ##ary coffee , tea or fresh juice delivered to our room daily . They have a nice restaurant at the hotel with a nice bar area which is good for a night ##cap and dessert ! There was a slight s ##na ##fu one day with our room not being made up , but Nikki the hotel manager as well as the house ##keeping manager were very helpful and handled the situation very professionally . The location of this hotel is great ! We enjoy staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in great area , convenient to Navy Pier and to great restaurants . All within walking distance . The bed and pillows were great and the views were excellent . I would stay here again and recommend it to others . If you drive to Chicago as I did , expect to pay at least $ 40 . 00 per night for parking , even in private lots . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the bath ##tub was not draining well . the bath ##tub should be checked to make sure its working well , we paid for our hotel with breakfast included , we were shocked , served the same food for the 4 days , to the point were tired of eating the something for 4 days . house keeping was excellent , the room was kept clean , the people in the room next to ours were very no ##ic ##y , yelling [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two nights in the hotel and our whole stay was great ! The agent who checked us in explained everything about my team member benefits . We loved the room and the am ##bian ##ce of the place . Will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent fitness center that costs $ 15 per day unless it ’ s com ##p ’ d with your room . The rooms are not well maintained and the age of the hotel is showing . The bar is a decent hotel bar and the lobby has a random ass ##ort ##ment of shops . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have stayed in the hotel multiple times . The last stay is probably going to be my last stay with them . The room carpet was sticky and with c ##rum ##bs all over . The bathroom had hair everywhere and looked extremely bad . They did shine my shoes and provided foam pillows . I cannot recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk staff was efficient and helpful in getting me checked in far before regular check - in time ( arrived at 8 am ) . Can ' t beat the location across from Grant Park - so much to do and explore all within a few miles of the front door . Great restaurants to eat at close by and very safe location for solo women travelers . G ##ave 4 instead of 5 stars because dinner at the bar was only okay , and when I called for more pillows for my room I was told I could only have two . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel ! Perfect location for experiencing the parks and lake and river and shopping adventures ! Everyone from check in , v ##alet , room attendant , bell hop to every interaction was so super friendly ! We are all super impressed that in downtown Chicago not 99 % but 100 % of the staff were that friendly ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Because of how much we loved our stay , I already gave a five - star Google review and survey for the hotel . The room was wonderful , the staff friendly , and the compliment ##ary treats appreciated . We loved the view of the room . We called the room " home " and said , " I can live here ! " Every time we entered or exited the hotel we were greeted by smiling staff member who held the door open for us . We have been r ##aving about this hotel experience with our friends and family since we ' ve left ! It was central ##ly and convenient ##ly located so everything was very easy to get to . The con ##cier ##ge gave us clear and con ##cise directions on how to get there from the airport using the subway . The room had a wonderful am ##bian ##ce and was extremely clean . You will not be disappointed if you stay here ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed the weekend with my father . Room ##s were clean and quiet but quite small ( which is normal for downtown Chicago ) . Could see Lake Michigan and Navy Pier from our hotel room window . Door ##men were excellent with helping my dad , who was in a wheelchair . You can find a pretty good deal on a weekend room if you book early enough but food there was quite expensive . Two beers and two hot ##dog ##s were $ 42 at the rivers ##ide hot ##dog cafe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife , daughter and myself stayed at The Ki ##nz ##ie for eight nights . Out stay was delight ##ful . From the moment we entered the hotel , we were made to feel welcome and valued as guests . The front desk staff were helpful and co - operative at all times and offered good advice when asked . Our room consisted of two Queen beds which were comfortable . The room was spacious and the linen clean . The bathroom was large and perfectly clean with plenty of hot water . The continental breakfast was well received by all three of us as there was something there for everybody . The only thing missing was fresh water . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , great staff ( friendly and helpful ) , was able to check in early , self parking on site with in / out privileges , really nice rooms . Great location . I would definitely stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just about everything was perfect for our two night stay . Breakfast was just your average box ##ed eggs and continental style food choice . Only complaint is that the parking is $ 60 a night . Use the v ##alet service because it is much more convenient . I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I selected this hotel because of the location and that is spot on . P ##ractical ##ly everything downtown is walking distance , including some great restaurants . The rooms are all suites and they are clean however , I do miss a mini fridge . In terms of de ##cor nothing really special , nothing gets a second look . I have to am ##end that , our room had a great view . The gym is 24 hours but no business office or guest printer . The service was uneven but people were basically polite . Seriously , it was fine . It ' s just that we were expecting better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We used All ##egro for our hotel wedding block . We received so many compliment ##s on how beautiful the hotel was , how comfortable the beds were , how fun the champagne hour was , the whole she ##bang . There were four wedding groups there over the weekend and it must have been so he ##ctic having them all f ##ending for their service , and yet they still made us feel like royalty . Every person that worked there including the bell ##hop ##s , the front desk attendant ##s , the cleaning crew , and special event coordinator ##s were incredibly at ##ten ##tive and helped not only us , but our guests throughout the weekend . I cannot recommend enough spending either one night or having an event at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Reserve ##d a suite for business . A ##rri ##ved and was treated like I was a bother . Plus , he said there is no late check ##out because I was in a suite . The “ suite ” as it turned out was simply two me ##dio ##cre small ##ish adjoining rooms with a view of the roof . The table was very dirty and there was no water or any of the normal SP ##G member good ##ies . This is the second She ##rato ##n stay in a row that I have been very disappointed . For the price , you can do much better than this this She ##rato ##n in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed in this hotel a couple of times and I can say that it is a winner on two fronts ; first is the location which is a walking distance to the Navy Pier and Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and second is the proximity to the river . The lobby is nice but always busy . However , it does have a nice Star ##bu ##cks . The reception staff is good and im ##bi ##be Star ##wood values . The bell desk needs to be a bit more friendly towards guests . The rooms are big and amazing . The river views that you get from the room are so relaxing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the best , most convenient , friendly , hi - tech Hotel we have stayed in in Chicago ! The location was near all the places we were going : ma ##g mile shopping , favorite restaurants e ##ct . Also , right now they have a special that includes breakfast & parking . We were there 4 three nights & wished we could have stayed longer . High ##ly recommend ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My previous comments reflect my experience . My overall experience was good except for a couple encounters with the morning staff . The check - in desk was extraordinary and the v ##alet gentleman was so helpful and nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt is my Favorite Hotel in Chicago and I have been to many hotels . I like the front entrance . I like the v ##alet service . I like the underground levels and they lead to lower W ##ack ##er . The views are Amazing ! ! ! ! The b ##uff ##et is delicious . The bar is great ! The house ##keeping staff are so nice . . . . I can ’ t say enough [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for almost a week and I was treated very well . The reception staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and made me feel super welcome . The 252 ##5 room has great corner views during the day and night . I tried their American G ##rill and Bar and it was superb as well . I definitely enjoyed my stay here and will come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I cannot say enough wonderful things about the staff . Cha ##rc ##oa ##l in was a breeze . Our car was loaded with boxes , a nightstand , bags , and mi ##s ##cell ##aneous items . The bell ##hop ##s surrounded our car and un ##loaded everything onto cart ##s , then proceeded to get all if it to our room . Then we had another load of 15 more boxes which were shipped to a friend in Chicago . That night we picked up those boxes and the bell ##hop ##s did it again . The next morning they loaded several loads onto our car . The rooms were incredibly comfortable . The location is in the Gold Coast area , so lots surrounding hotel . We are very grateful to the staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect stay from the moment we walked through the door . The bell hop was super friendly and when we asked him for directions he not only gave great directions but he walked us through the hotel and out the back door to make sure we knew exactly how to get there . The con ##cier ##ge was also very helpful with a breakfast recommendation of Egg ##ys ( which was very close and had un ##believable food ) and the arc ##ite ##ct ##ual tour . The issue we had with the con ##cier ##ge was that the walk took a little longer then she said and we are fast walk ##ers . The best part of the hotel was our room . The views are amazing of the city , lake and the river . See my pictures . The room was also clean and modern . We will definitely be back ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had an issue with the blow dry ##er . I thought it was going to explode . I called the front desk and had one within 5 minutes . Great price for the night & the room was very nice . The only cave ##at was learning to work the “ rain shower . ’ [SEP]
1	[CLS] this hotel is nice and well located however the room service menu is terrible and limit ##ted and it is horrible ( everything served in tray ##s like bent ##o boxes ) . The reception / front desk staff never smile and do not make you feel welcome . Certainly there are m ##nu ##ch better choices in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed in Chicago dozens of times . This is my new favorite hotel . The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . The rooms were large , modern , and quiet . And the location is smack da ##b in the middle of everything - Michigan avenue , amazing restaurants , and midway between Hancock / Water Tower and the river , bean , etc . The on ##site restaurant / bar had excellent food and wonderful atmosphere / view . I will definitely be staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice rooms ! Central ##ly located and helpful staff ! Oliver was so helpful in taking care of getting our bags out front . He then helped look for our ride that was a little lost . Super nice guy and great at his job ! Pool was small but very nice and clean . Man , I know this might not be a big deal to some but why can ' t hotels use better toilet paper . I swear the airport has softer toilet paper ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very much enjoyed my stay . Staff were very re ##sp ##ons ##ive to my needs . Hilton ' s are my first choice . Great location . Breakfast was excellent and enjoyed the bar for a glass of wine before dinner . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was of a decent size . View was not great from room 91 ##8 , but the room was nice . Great toilet ##ries . The staff was at ##ten ##tive and genuine . Really enjoyed the stay . It was a short walk to Mill ##ennial Park and many many restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff , security and housekeeper ##s were friendly , helpful , and knowledge ##able . This seriously goes a long way , and I will never stay anywhere else when I travel to Chicago . Room was awesome : clean , beautifully appointed and Q ##UI ##ET . My favorite place - the bathroom was excellent . Show ##er was really cool , C ##rab ##tree and Evelyn toilet ##ries . Love . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is in a very convenient location in Chicago . There are many food options within the hotel as well as outside the hotel . The room was very clean and comfortable . No issues . There are many places to meet others or get work done with w ##if ##i and power in the common areas of the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first time staying at The Talbot ##t . It is very welcoming and co ##zy . The hotel was nicely decorated for the holidays including a cute dog house that highlighted the pet charity they were don ##ating to . I love any business that helps animals ! My room was a nice size and very comfortable . All of the staff were helpful and friendly . We ate at the restaurant and the food was fantastic . The hotel is within walking distance of many great restaurants . I walked to one on my own one night and felt completely safe . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Palmer house is like stepping back in time to old Hollywood . Absolutely love it here and will definitely be in April for my birthday trip ! The staff was amazing and very welcoming / a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Palmer is in a prime location to see the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a meeting and what a great place . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located to all downtown shopping and eating . Every ##day morning tea and coffee and evening wine . The rooms are spacious and q ##ui ##rky . The beds are comfortable . I ’ d definitely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Given that I was one of arguably 10 guests in the entire hotel , I can ##t say I was surprised at how barren the place was . Even the main lobby rest ##rooms were locked . In fact , minus the lobby , star ##bu ##cks , and the elevators , nothing was open . While the staff were nice , I had a major problem with the couch in my room and the downstairs staff just took it as a non ##chal ##ant comment . I was there for several hearings and actually needed the suite living room for work . When my clients pointed out the dirty couch , it was too late to re ##ct ##ify with the staff . Color me surprised that post ho ##c nothing was done too . The rest of the room was excellent and the internet speeds were the fastest I ' ve ever seen in a hotel , bar none . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They ' ve updated this property nicely and managed to keep all the old - world charm of the building . Really enjoyed the spacious lobby and the friendly people . Vale ##t steered me away from a bad restaurant choice in the neighborhood and hooked me up with a better one . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel located within walking distance of Chicago ' s Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , great restaurants and Millennium Park . The staff were excellent and made you feel like you were the only guest registered at the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d this hotel . I stayed her on business a few months ago . It ' s a great location . And you can walk to almost anywhere from here . The bar is really nice and they do happy hour too ! The hotel is a little older but super well maintained . The w ##if ##i is great too . Room ##s are therefore not your standard USA size , a little smaller , think European Chain type sizes . Breakfast in the restaurant was great , service a little low but worth the wait . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is located right on the river in the middle of downtown . Very easy walk to Navy Pier and any of the architecture water tours you ' d want to take in Chicago . My room had a great view of the river and city . The rooms could be updated a little , but weren ' t too bad . The gym had a lot of great equipment including a P ##ela ##ton bike that I was a bit in ##ti ##mi ##dated to setup and try . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very pleasant bout ##ique hotel . Staff is helpful and friendly . Room ##s are clean and easy to navigate with above average appeal . Continental breakfast is minimal , but it ’ s an acceptable start for the day . This is a great little hotel at a far better price than the big chains down the street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ##not say enough about the staff at this Hilton . I have stayed here multiple times over the past four years and they are always extremely friendly and helpful . Everyone from the employees at the garage , bell ##hop , restaurants , retail stores and Cars ##arra at the front desk , have always been exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just spent three amazing nights at the Fair ##mont Millennium Park . The rooms were spacious , bright and clean with both a bath and shower . Very com ##fy beds ! The hotel ' s location is perfect . Walking distance to Millennium park , Chicago Art Institute , Navy Pier , River ##walk , and many more of Chicago ' s main attractions . Great view of the park and the lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came downtown for my sisters bachelor ##ette weekend and decided to stay here . What a great decision . Central ##ly located in the loop close to restaurants , theaters and shopping . The hotel is exquisite in its de ##cor . The staff can not be anymore friendly and ready to accommodate you . Every evening between 5 - 6 ##pm with your room key there is free Pro ##se ##co or Sang ##ria in the lobby bar area . And believe me all the guests take advantage of it . Right now they are doing a bit of construction so there are some noisy periods but besides that no complaints . Room ##s decent size for downtown . Love their amenities . Bonus there is a Star ##bu ##cks connected to the hotel on the first floor . I usually am not disappointed by a Kim ##pton property and I can add this one to the list . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , one of the best hotels within the Hilton brand in Chicago . Great rooms , great location ( north of River , close to Ma ##g Mile ) . Can be a little price ##y and occasional di ##s ##function ##al in the restaurant . Great rooftop bar . My got ##o when in Chicago , when the rates are decent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When in Chicago , make sure you stay at the O ##m ##ni . Great location , service above all others and an excellent dining experience . Staff was wonderful , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . Love ##d the $ 10 beer and b ##urger at Happy Hour . Made the overall stay even better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Besides having the opportunity to see left ##over food in the mini fridge from the previous guest , it was great . I ' ve been to nice ##r hotels that were cheaper but you really do pay for the name and prime location of the hotel . I did not have great views because I did not pay for that option when booking the room . I wanted the hotel just to go out to dinner with friends and have a place to sleep . [SEP]
