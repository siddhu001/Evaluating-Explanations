1	[CLS] The rooms are so ##o old . The furniture etc . Una ##cc ##ept ##able in comparison of what you have to pay . A few days later I stayed at a host ##el ( the Free ##hand ) and this was much better ( quality of furniture , design of the rooms , the bar area , coffee lounge ) , and way cheaper . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed at the H ##ya ##tt Regency while attending a large conference off - site . Pa ##id for upgrade to a higher floor . Not recommended . Room was not overly clean and not sufficiently cleaned each day . Floor was never v ##ac ##ume ##d , garbage not emptied from the the cans , drinking glasses not replaced when used . To ##ler ##able but certainly less than expected . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ( in front of Nike Town ) , service , and infrastructure . E ##ff ##icient , polite , and friendly staff . I would definitely stay at O ##m ##ni Chicago again ! Room was very clean , I asked for an extra re ##f ##rig ##ira ##tor and the hotel was ready to provide me one . Excellent living room , separate from the bedroom , ideal for more than one person to stay with different schedules . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I booked this hotel for my birthday get ##away with my sister and I ' m very pleased with my choice . We came early to the hotel to see if we could check in early , they said our room wasn ' t available yet , but they checked our bags so we didn ' t have to carry them around while we walked . Pleasant ##ly surprised by that . We got a room on the 19 floor , good view , nice people at check in . My favorite part of my stay was the bartender ##s at the hotel bar . They knew how to make every drink that was being ordered , big plus they were super friendly and gave me a free drink because it was my birthday ! ! I will definitely be staying at this hotel the next time I ' m in Chicago . Good price for the room , lots of accommodation ##s and great location . Walking distance to everything downtown . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I have stayed in Chicago many times , usually in the heart of The Loop . This was the first time we two chose to stay north of downtown . We were not sorry ! The hotel is beautiful , our room was comfortable and well appointed and the service was excellent . I love old hotels , so the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker definitely fit the bill ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff & room was great ! G ##reet ##ed and welcomed as soon as I arrived . Work ##ed with all my accommodation ##s . . . . Room was clean and co ##zy . Lots of great food and shopping in the area . Will definitely here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived to a warm welcome from Erin at reception . She was really helpful . Our suite was very clean and spacious . Breakfast was very nice . The evening social between 17 . 00 and 19 . 00 was a very nice addition . Nice snack food , wine and beer . Really recommend this hotel . It ' s also a great location , u can walk to Ba ##vy pier and river walk fairly close by [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a customer meeting at this location , and they were great to work with . I couldn ' t recommend them enough . The event coordinator and the staff is on top of everything . The meeting room and hotel rooms are extremely nice with a lot of windows . Also , has a good dinner option ( Ba ##pt ##ise and Bo ##ttle ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel very old but historic place that has been updated to today ’ s stuff . Still has the charm from when it was built . Bed was very comfortable . We had a king room very large . Subway noises but it ’ s right down town close to everything if you are planning on walking the city this is a great spot to start from . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##ER ##Y di ##s ##res ##pect ##ful front desk . Tri ##es to up sell and when you refuse they give you a sub - par room . When you complain about that they send strong arm security to in ##ti ##mi ##date . Moving to another hotel now . Did not expect this on my F ##IR ##ST experience from Hilton . W ##IL ##L NO ##T B ##O ##OK AT AN ##Y H ##IL ##TO ##N PR ##OP ##R ##RT ##IE ##S E ##VE ##R AG ##A ##IN ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] 1st time visiting your beautiful city . What a great experience . The hotel was awesome along with staff . We were in walking distance of so many sights . Our view was extremely wonderful and the people were so friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I checked in late on Sunday night via online check ##in and was given a nice east - facing room on the 31st floor . I found it to be a bit small - - especially since I was staying for a week . I called into the H ##ya ##tt Global ##ist line to ask if any suites were available and they contacted the front desk on my behalf and made the request . The manager asked if I wanted to move that night ( it was already 11 : 30 ##p ) , but since I didn ' t , said a suite would be avail the next morning . They moved my bags to the new room and I enjoyed suite 112 ##7 in West tower - - with a great view facing the river . Thank you H ##ya ##tt Regency staff for making my stay just right ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is at a very convenient location within walking distance of major attractions . Our room was on the 25th floor overlooking Navy Pier ; beautiful view , particularly at night . The room was spacious with a king bed , a 60 inch nice TV and 4 - piece bathroom . The internet was free and reliable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here for a trade show and it was during an extremely cold snap ! The temperature outside was down to - 20 at least , so to have such a comfortable place to stay was really important to make the most of our visit ! Check in was court ##eous and speed ##y . The food at the restaurant was delicious . We had a very com ##fy bed and good room . The bar ( a signature feature of the hotel ) was amazing and very s ##ty ##lish ! All in all a fantastic stay ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My visit to the Fair ##mont Millennium Park overall was very good . There were a couple issues but what makes a good hotel is when the staff can fix them promptly and still give you the attention a Fair ##mont guest anti ##ci ##pate ##s . Man ##dan ##a on the Fair ##mont Gold floor was amazing . So sweet and making sure my husband and I were taken care of . Thank you dear . Mark at the front desk took great care of me several times . Also John at the front desk made sure my issues with the room were handled . Jesus on the Fair ##mont Gold level was so inform ##ative and such a pleasure . Thank you also Cody ! I would love to come back again soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with the family and it was great ! There ’ s history and great hospitality at this place . The staff was helpful and friendly all around . I would definitely return ! There ’ s no room service , but plenty of snack ##s and drink options in the room . There ’ s also a breakfast option and ma ##rt ##ini bar with pub food options in the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 2nd time staying here . My only negative comment would be how loud the hallway ##s are , you can hear conversations from hallway in bedrooms in room . Walls are paper thin . Breakfast b ##uff ##et was really good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently attended a conference in Chicago . We stayed at the O ##m ##ni Chicago Hotel . The rooms were large and s ##pec ##ious . I had a nice view of the city . King size bed . I was in quite area on the floor . The rooms could use a little update with the texture ##d wall paper and the coach in my room was fading in color I guess due to the sun from the windows . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay . The staff is amazing and the location is premium . I recommend getting a suite . It is well worth the price . The corner suite is one of our favorites , but all the rooms are spacious and super clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed here couple of times before - last trip 2018 . Room was clean with everything you want supplied - great view of the W ##rig ##ley Building ( see p ##ic ) . Breakfast b ##uff ##et supplied all you needed . Evening food provided ( I was there Wednesday & Thursday nights ) was great with everything being re ##ple ##nish ##ed as it was running low . I didn ##t have to wait for elevators at all ( re ##ceipt ##ion in on 6th floor with rooms starting above which give great views over the city ) . Good w ##if ##i and hot water in shower / bath had good pressure . Bed was comfortable and AC works will in the room . Will happily stay again when am back in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great experience ! Every staff member was so helpful and incredibly kind ! The atmosphere from the bar … to library area … to the v ##alet … incredible staff ! Very clean as well ! Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and would highly recommend to anyone coming to that area of Chicago ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Summer weekend get ##away . This is our go to place . Sure it ' s big and sure it ' s busy but you ' re in Chicago . The staff is very know ##led ##gable and the rooms are clean and quiet . We did have an issue with a damp smell when we first arrived . Most likely because the air had not been running and it was humid outside . We called room service and someone was at the door in less than 15 minutes to fix the problem and spray the carpet ( it did the trick , no problems after that ) . We ' ll continue to make this our Wind ##y City choice ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk lady named Leah was rude and had an attitude from the start . Iron ##ically I was here for a work conference that focuses on customer experience . She clearly shouldn ' t be in hospitality - - the manager , Stephen , was court ##eous and a ##pol ##og ##etic , but it left a bad taste . Would not recommend as there are plenty other options in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked a block of rooms for a business function and everyone was extremely happy with their accommodation ##s . The rooms are beautifully appointed with tons of sweet little extra ##s . . . like the N ##es ##press ##o coffee machine , awesome toilet ##ries , and automatic black ##out curtains . St ##un ##ning city views from my 18th floor room . Lu ##x ##uri ##ous ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Whenever possible , we stay at O ##m ##ni Hotels . We always appreciate the spacious rooms and friendly staff . The rooms are always comfortable and well appointed . The location of the O ##m ##ni Chicago is perfect for sights ##ee ##ing or shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very well located , close to good restaurants and shops . It is very con ##fort ##able and with great service . The restaurant offers so many amazing options at breakfast as at meals . I recommend try the eggs Benedict . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was perfect and very relaxing . We were sad to miss the managers reception this time but have gone to it several times before . G ##reet ##ed warmly by the bell captain and then by the front desk . The hotel was spot ##less [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came back to room from dinner , did some computer work , prepared to watch TV . The TV was cracked and un ##watch ##able . Called the desk at 10 ##pm . A new TV was delivered and set up in about 20 minutes ! W ##OW ! That is service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was amazing . The staff and the amenities exceeded my expectations . I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the area . It is close to several attractions as well . The meeting areas are amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t to Chicago with some friends and stayed at the Kim ##pton All ##egro . Super cool building that has a modern meets Art Dec ##o v ##ibe . Great location near the financial district , miracle mile and all the downtown offerings . As great as this place is to stay , the best part of the Kim ##pton is the customer service . The front desk , Leah , was beyond exceptionally amazing . Will definitely come back here next time we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful experience . We were close to shopping , food and the sites . Staff was helpful and pleasant . Will stay there again . The bar is beautiful , the rooms were very clean , the breakfast was great [SEP]
1	[CLS] Though I had confirmation email in my hand they could not find the appropriate reservation . They blamed me for arriving two days early . Instead of being on the executive floor per reservation they put me in a tiny shoe box of a room . Room was old and mold ##y . So , back to the front desk . R ##ude agents . Manager not available . Finally , they put me in a massive suite . It was huge though bedroom portion wasn ’ t . Room was mold ##y and aged . Can ' t believe that they weren ' t a ##pol ##og ##etic nor helpful in solving for a problem that Hilton created . Why make the customer feel they are imposing on the front desk agent and hotel ? ? So I checked out and moved to Kim ##pton Gray ( awesome service and facilities ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location but is price ##y because of it . Our room was tiny and we could people in the room next to us talking . The bed was comfortable but the pillows were either a rock or flat as a pan ##cake . The lobby was beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got to say what a lovely trip was had and the hotel was great very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Great affinity for the Irish , will be back , a pity about the weather [UNK] . S ##l ##á ##int ##e . PS a big shout out to Dave the door man , he ' ll sort u out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at the Ambassador Chicago . The location was perfect - in a nice ##r area close to but not directly amid Ma ##g Mile , so it was quiet ##er and cleaner . Just a few blocks away from Lake Shore Drive . Our room was very comfortable . The only somewhat negative thing was the bathroom which was very small . The restaurant and bar were nice and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful . Vale ##t parking was a bit price ##y - $ 58 for overnight . If you don ' t need to access your car during your stay , there are other , cheaper options nearby . The hotel bar used to be the famed P ##ump Room , and it was fun to look at all the photos of movie and t ##v stars who have been there - go downstairs by the gym to see them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You are right at / in the loop . The hotel is clean and very hip . The staff is super focused on customer service - - which has been my experience the one other time I stayed at a Kim ##pton ( Shore ##break , Huntington Beach ) . Cool window seat / beds in the room , where my son lay like a cat . Very reasonably priced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for a conference in late - April . Beautiful location , beautiful hotel . I had a room on the 9th floor , two beds with two bathroom ##s . That is a first for me . The room had a view of another building but I wasn ' t in the room enough to matter . The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean . The staff at the hotel was great and I would definitely staff there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They checked me into an occupied room ! ! ! I l ##ug ##ged my crap to front desk . Then to another room with not even an apology . It was the no ##sies ##t room ever with sire ##ns and motorcycles all night . Next day I got to be room s ##t 5 : 10 O ##M and get hasn ’ t even cleaned it yet ! ! Really ! ! How much crap can go wrong ? ! ? ! And management was worthless , lacked em ##pathy ’ , and not account ##able . I ##MI Do NO ##T stay here even if the room is free . The place sucks and so does management . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The rooms are very clean , comfortable , and modern . The building is quite old , but everything is so im ##ma ##culate and well - maintained it only adds to the character of the place . I have to give a shout - out to the quality of the room service food , too - it definitely isn ’ t your typical per ##fu ##nc ##tory hotel kitchen fare ! Overall , I was thrilled with the place and would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great facility and great location ! Staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and made us feel very welcome . We were in the city to watch our granddaughter , Lily , appear in the N ##ut ##c ##racker . Very rainy weekend but it didn ' t de ##ter any shopping , etc . for us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ent but room was small , dark . No drawers to un ##pack clothes into . No counter space or storage in bathroom . Up ##grade to club floor was worth it for food and drinks in club lounge . They are making me write 200 characters . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I really enjoyed this trip to Chicago . The hotel was clean and the amenities were very nice . The W ##if ##i was great and the view from my room was wonderful . The staff were nice and professional . I would stay here again if visiting the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Conrad for business recently . The hotel was beautiful and my room was exceptional but the best part was Mr . Mi ##cha ##il Williams , Guest Ambassador . He was so professional , helpful and nice . Thanks for raising bar Mi ##cha ##il , I will definitely return each time I am in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family of three stayed here and we loved it . We arrived early from a road trip and a room was available . - big space in rooms - nice bathroom with both tub and shower - had a great city view - super com ##fy beds - walking distance to shopping area , navy pier , Willis tower - has a star ##bu ##cks nearby - clean ! Would stay here again on our next visit . [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in Fair ##mont Gold Room King . The de ##cor in the room was very nice with lots of space and excellent view of parks and lake . Bed very comfortable . Gold lounge very good for light breakfast and small cakes in evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 8 nights . Well positioned for central city . Certainly more of a suite , , , , king bed , f ##rig , microwave , cook ##top , cooking and service war ##es . Multiple rooms and w ##if ##i seemed ok . Des ##k large enough to work off of . Book ##ing price was jumping all over the place for a week before I bought . 229 to over 400 , , , , , as I said , varied a lot day to day . Breakfast very basic . Dec ##or and furnishings ok . Everything seems clean . Check ##in is 4 ##pm , and that catches many people ##off guard , as seems rooms are generally not ready before then . I would surely come back again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was gorgeous . Yes the v ##alet is a little over ##p ##rice ##d , but the staff was on point and so friendly . We absolute loved the fact that they allowed our fur ##ry companions without a fee ! They even had a dog ##gy bag waiting ! As for the room , there are a few extra ##s that I wish were available such as an empty fridge , a microwave and some better pillows . The bed wasn ’ t the most comfortable compared to other hotels . Overall it was great , just a few things that we could have used . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed there for a few weeks . . Location excellent . . very convenient . Service excellent . . The entire crew was very pleasant and helpful . . always welcomed you with a smile . . L ##yne ##tte . . . did go out of the way to ask if we were doing well and if we needed anything . . All the managers too were very helpful . . . and not to forget the security person . . . He was equally pleasant and helpful : ) En ##joy ##ed our stay . . . clean ##liness . . excellent . . CO ##VI ##D pre ##ca ##ution ##s . . Good Total ##ly a satisfactory stay . . would be my place to stay if I visit Chicago again . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Its just right . Small hotel with a personal touch but largest enough for plenty of services and a great location . I wouldn ' t stay anywhere else . Love ##d the restaurant and bar - coffee in the lobby in the morning . It takes away the s ##ter ##ile feeling of business travel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice ##r than the pictures and the rooms are not as ch ##ees ##y as the photos . The red colors were not as invasive as I imagined . The bed has a feather top ##per which makes it incredible comfortable . Room ##s are quiet so not much noise from hallway : steps , doors closing , etc . I think this is a very strong 4 star hotel . Of course way better than she ##rato ##ns of the world , but not quite a competitor to Peninsula . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our suite was spectacular with views of the water and millennium Park thanks to Bradley Russell , Alexander checked us in efficiently and with an up ##beat manner . The con ##cier ##ge Á ##lex made arrangements for a boat tour and answered all our questions . F ##abulous Hotel we highly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a solid hotel with great rooms and views out to Lake Mi ##cha ##gen . Nice bedroom layout ##s and bathroom . They have an amazing gym on the top floor with great views across Chicago plus the gym is well kit ##ted out with good equipment . Downs ##ide was check in with a que ##ue that took 40 m ##utt ##on get to front of which is a world record for me . The reception are at the front is also Lac ##king more seat and private space very limited for such a big hotel . Up ##side views , gym and great position to look around central Chicago and see the sites and well as shop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights in August to see the City , shop , eat and cheer on the Cubs . The room was a double and it was huge , like really huge with great views out towards Navy Pier . The location was great for the Park , Michigan Avenue , bars , restaurants and public transportation . We didn ' t eat at the bar / restaurant in the hotel , but it looked very inviting . Bath ##room was spacious with a separate door for the toilet and an area outside the bathroom as a van ##ity / bar area . I would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I expect to see G ##able and Lombard descending the steps into the bar at any moment . Beautiful hotel and customer service is exceptional . It ’ s not a new hotel but beautifully maintained historic hotel . Room service is speed ##y and food is hot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The elevators are spectacular ! They are old for sure but have been re ##mo ##del ##ed . They are quick and seem to work s ##yme ##nta ##nio ##us ##ly with each other so there are no long waits . The gentlemen on the ground floor usually helped you into them and pushed the floor number . It was just the best experience ever ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love these grand old hotels . We have stayed at the Hilton for weekends in the City on a number of occasions over the past 25 years or so . The last couple of years we have been particularly attracted by the reasonable lo ##dging rates just before the holidays . We booked a 15th floor room with two baths and double queen beds . The room was spacious with updated furniture and a relatively new flat screen TV . W ##if ##i was available with our Hilton Honors . We enjoyed dinner at the pub and a continental breakfast in the hotel restaurant . The fitness / pool area is te ##rri ##fic . The rest of our weekend was spent on the Miracle Mile shopping . We plan to do the same thing next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A wonderful bout ##ique hotel where you are assured of personal service . The accommodation ##s are lovely and the hotel restaurant is worth a trip in itself . Great location and charming am ##bian ##ce , very European . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The employees were beyond rude at check in . We asked for quiet room . The girl P ##UR ##PO ##SE ##L ##Y put us next to elevator and pool . When we asked for a second room , she was annoyed and made us wait . AL ##L employees were di ##s ##res ##pect ##ful . Other guests were complaining too . Find somewhere else to stay . Lots of great places . This isn ’ t one [SEP]
1	[CLS] G ##SA Kay was very helpful in helping us get a room . Bell ##man Is ##hm ##ael was very helpful and pleasant . The room was a nice size and that there was a refrigerator in the room . We were happy with the room and would love to visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lots of positive ##s at The Conrad : attractive rooms , amazing ##ly comfortable beds , large , modern luxurious bathroom ##s . But regarding many issues , the front desk staff totally missed the mark for a hotel of this caliber . The con ##sie ##rge was pleasant but un ##hel ##pf ##ul . Print ##ing a boarding pass took 45 minutes due to the staff being unable to figure out how to get the printer to work . They need to step it up . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can ’ t say enough nice things about the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . The location is perfect , walking distance to all sights ##ee ##ing venues , food and night life just around the corner . The staff were so pleasant . Night crew Ra ##ul and Jamal were always there to greet us when we came in the door every night . Lauren on days is so sweet and always willing to answer questions . Bart ##ender Josh is the best , always g ##ree ##eting us with a smile and song . And who can complain about free Happy Ho ##r every day ! Can ’ t wait to visit Chicago again and I will definitely stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel when I do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I surprised my wife with a night in Chicago and a theater show . We were very amazed how beautifully decorated the room was . The entire hotel was amazing ! Some have stated the rooms are small , we found it comfortable and just fine . Front desk service was absolutely phenomena ##l . East check in and helpful explaining things . Very convenient to the Cadillac Palace Theater and short walk to State St . and Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the t ##v in the rooms I just wish it had am ##az ##on prime I love the hotel all it needs is a j ##ac ##uz ##zi and a microwave it was a bit upset ##ting that we didn ’ t have one on the floor we were staying on but I love the location it was perfect and so was the service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything in Chicago comes down to location at the end of the day . Swiss ##ote ##l has some s ##pi ##ffy extra ##s , like nice views , fast elevators with no surprises , comfortable beds and deep bath ##tub ##s , but we were there for the location . We had tickets to Hamilton , and it ' s walking distance from the Cadillac , perfectly located to take advantage of Michigan avenue , we ' ll located to spend a day at millennium park , and since we were there over the 4th , we only had to step out front to watch the fireworks . The parking garage is super tight , so good luck if you ' re driving a SUV . Our mini ##van was a challenge to park . The pool was closed when we visited , but hey , one must maintain sometime , right ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] After recently selling our downtown con ##do , we needed our Chicago fix and the Conrad fit the bill perfectly . Love ##ly , contemporary room and large bathroom along with comfortable beds and pillows made our stay very enjoyable . A great location . Will be back to try the rooftop bar as weather didn ' t allow that to happen . Linda checked that we were enjoying our stay . Thought that was a nice touch . We will return ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We can not recommend this place enough . The staff - especially Marvin and Brian ##na have made our stay so special here in Chicago . They take customer service to another level , we leave feeling like we have made new friends . We are definitely coming back again ! The facilities are superb , all staff are friendly and can ’ t do enough for you , the breakfast is second to none , the location is perfect for all activities you ’ ll want to do nearby . If you ’ re ever in Chicago find the Hilton 720 Michigan Avenue and look no further . Your trip will be complete just for staying in this magical place . Thank you Marvin & Brian ##na , From the ever grateful Tu ##rley family x ##x ##x [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a one night stay with my husband as a stop over on our way up to W ##au ##ke ##gan for a Navy G ##rad ##uation . We arrived late and were upgraded into an amazing suite at the top with amazing views . Excellent location , In the morning we walked over to the park and then to get breakfast . Con ##cier ##ge was awesome and gave us some great ideas for how to spend our few hours in Chicago . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a corner room which was dual aspect and very bright , worth asking for one if you can . This was my third stay at a Conrad and certainly up to scratch . Room was great size , very comfortable bed and luxurious bathroom . Friendly and efficient house ##keeping . Unfortunately I didn ' t try out the bar or gym , so can ' t comment on those . This property is worth considering for those that want a bit of a luxury at a decent price . My only grip ##e was that I didn ' t get the credits I was promised for being a Hilton Gold , I ' ll take this up with Hilton separately . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Da ##ting from the 1800 ’ s , the hotel is a g ##rac ##ious reminder of hotels of another era . The huge column ##ed lobby is a meeting place for everyone . Am ##ple seating to have a drink or a coffee or just to chat , provides a comfortable setting before leaving . The desk clerk was most helpful & made sure we knew the working ##s of the hotel . Stay ##ing on the executive floor gave us breakfast ##s & late day snack ##s as well as access to soft beverages throughout the day . Our room was spacious & always made up to be welcoming after s day out . The lunch we had in the main restaurant was excellent in every way . Service throughout our stay was exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel had a great location and friendly , helpful staff . The rooms were very clean , we had a suite and it was very well designed , easily a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting our family of five . Close to great shopping , bus lines , and in walking distance to city landmarks , L train , and surrounded by a variety of great restaurants as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the She ##rato ##n grand Chicago on a trip celebrating our 31st wedding anniversary and found it a fantastic location from which to explore a wonderful city . Our room overlooked the river and we had a great view of Trump tower . The room was s ##pec ##ious , clean with a large king sized bed , big TV and please ##nt bathroom . The staff were very helpful and even gave us the odd free upgrade due to it being our anniversary . The normal tourist at ##raction ##s were walk ##able from the hotel and the area around it felt safe . I would have no hesitation in recommend ##ing this hotel for anyone visiting the city on a short break . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel . The rooms are fresh and nicely appointed . Friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff were always willing to go the extra mile . There are a few nice places to eat within walking distance . En ##joy ##ed the Breakfast as always [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second visit to Chicago and we stayed at the same hotel . The staff is very friendly and helpful . It is clean and the beds were very comfortable . We stayed on the 5th floor and the continental breakfast was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to everyone ' s taste b ##uds . The hotel is convenient ##ly located to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , restaurants , Navy Pier and many other attractions . I would recommend to my Mom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very pleasant welcome from door ##man etc . , on a very cold day . A ##rri ##ved on a very cold afternoon towards the end of the recent cold snap . The hotel is very modern , s ##ty ##lish , and spot ##lessly clean . All the staff were very helpful and very polite . The room was very comfortable , spacious and spot ##lessly clean . . Restaurant ##s were comfortable with good service and good quality food from an extensive menu . The location of the hotel is ideal ##ly located close to the river and convenient for site seeing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Chicago with easy access to hundreds of shops and restaurants . I arrived at the hotel at 1 : 30 pm ( 3 pm being normal check - in time ) and was told that my room was not ready , however I could check - in another room with a view right away if I paid an extra $ 25 / night , which I refused . Less than 2 minutes later , I was told that there was a room for me . Although , I was happy to be able to check - in early , I did not appreciate that the reception ##ist try to trick me into paying more . Also , during the 3rd day of my stay , the cleaning person did not leave any shower cloth in the bathroom . This also was unpleasant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The desk clerk was extremely helpful and very friendly the room had an amazing view and had everything i needed i would re ##cco ##men ##d your hotel to others very central ##ly located and all your stall was very helpful the elevators are great . . . . but not if your a control freak . . . lo ##l [SEP]
1	[CLS] M ; y husband and I stayed here last week . . . It looked like a nice hotel but totally exceeded our expectations . The Talbot ##t Hotel is a beautiful , huge rooms and the best location ! The service was amazing . Everyone we dealt with was so helpful and friendly . Next time we are in Chicago we will definitely stay here . Perry , Tim and Gene provided us excellent service along with everyone else at the hotel ! ! ! This hotel is A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I cannot stress how wonderful this hotel is . From the staff to the suites . Great hotel well worth the money . Only one problem which was solved as ##ap . The suites are great . B ##ump up to the one bedroom . If you are on business it feels like home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are on the small side , and the desk could use a lamp . A coffee maker would also be welcome . That said , the All ##egro is very well - located within the Loop , close to theatres and good restaurants . The rooms are clean ; the service is very friendly as well as highly competent . We would recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel at an amazing location in downtown . Room ##s come in studio apartment - style and offer a nice value for money . The room came with free breakfast which was good . It will definitely be my first choice to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is my youngest daughter ' s favorite in all of Chicago . Mostly for the fantastic window seats but also for the hotel staff . Last year they upgraded us for her birthday but this year they didn ' t . She was disappointed but soon got over it . I love Kim ##pton properties for their q ##ui ##rkin ##ess and co ##zy rooms . And of course their cool robes ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Hotel from 1st to 2nd of June . The Hotel Lo ##bby is quite impressive and check in was swift . However once I made it to the room , I found it only partly serviced . Pi ##llow ##s and other stuff just staged away in the corner . Not a good start . I went down to get another room . First reaction was , ' ' Oh , we are quite fully booked , let me check . . . . ” not the reaction one once to hear . Nevertheless , they managed to find a similar room , and w / o a comment I was let go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay here annually now for a weekend trip to Chicago with my girlfriend and another young couple , while I don ’ t explore the in ##tric ##ac ##ies of some hotel frequent ##ers ( there are longer lists of services available at nice ##r hotels like this one ) , I can speak for the comfort and high quality of the stay . Great price for the location in my humble opinion ! Short walk to the Loop , near the water , and right on the river too . Whole Foods is next door to fuel up for a long day , and U ##ber / L ##y ##ft pickup outside the She ##rato ##n is smooth and organized . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve recently made the move to Chicago , and have found my new favorite hotel [UNK] . Am ##ela served us and completely out ##di ##d each of my expectations . Not only was she extremely at ##ten ##tive to my numerous ' pick ##y drinking ' needs , she was : - super friendly while - staying professional - and gave amazing drink recommendations - made my friend and I some awesome drinks ! I am a firm believe ##r in giving credit where credit is due , so I sought her manager , Ben , to inform him of her stellar service . Ben also , was extremely friendly and very approach ##able . He even bought me and my friend a free round ! High ##ly recommend this bar . Can ' t wait to return [UNK] Safe Travel ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great stay - accommodation ##s are wonderful , staff is friendly and efficient and location is convenient . I am originally from Chicago so knew about many other hotels but am delighted I chose the Conrad - will definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We absolutely L ##O ##VE this hotel ! Room ##s are spectacular and the service is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble ! Location on Michigan Avenue is so convenient for everything we like to do . I would highly recommend this property for anyone visiting the city whether for business or personal ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in an amazing location . It was next to the River ##walk and all the shopping . Everything that we wanted to see and do was in walking distance . The staff was amazing ##ly helpful and friendly . Hussein ( i think was his name ) , the door ##man , was outgoing and was great with my daughter . The breakfast ##s were delicious with so much selection . Emerson knew our drink orders from previous visits and the cook was so cheerful in the morning . The hotel had a cute pool float movie night as well . I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very modern hotel ; our room was very spacious & very clean . We loved the waterfall shower in the bathroom ! The hotel was very well positioned for us , close to Michigan Avenue . Service was good & we would like to give a big thank you to David , the door ##man for organising a special transfer with Sam The Van Man to the airport . We made our flight with plenty of time . We would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Live ##d in Chicago and I never knew of this hotel . Just inside the loop , a great location to walk just about anywhere , including river north . It ' s a great bout ##ique hotel with comfortable accommodation ##s . The staff was superb . Good bar as well , even though felt that a decent single - ma ##lt was probably on the high priced end . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at the Talbot ##t in Chicago during a vacation trip that included several cities on the East Coast . Although the Talbot ##t has very fine accommodation ##s , what made the most difference to us was the attitude displayed and desire to please by hotel staff . We felt like we were visiting family . Our experience with this hotel was excellent and will return next time we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although comfortable and clean it was over priced and you had to pay to much for anything extra , for example Internet access was $ 13 is ##h , a bottle of water in the room $ 10 , a candy bar / box of Kit Kat ##s was $ 6 . I went across the street to the C ##VC Pharmacy to get snack ##s and water . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I were gifted a room on the 34th floor as part of our honeymoon trip . The view to Lake Shore Drive is incredible . Because the room was paid by others , there was a hit ##ch checking in , but the front desk was incredibly friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and got us checked in no problem . We even had to park our rental in the round ##about overnight until we could fix our flat tire , and Men ##ard and the v ##alet team were super g ##rac ##ious and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting while we searched for a tow truck . The location is wonderful ##ly ideal for downtown advent ##uring . It was an excellent stay ; top - notch and friendly customer service and state - of - the - art accommodation ##s . Experience certainly worth the price ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Park ##ing was not available . Check in was he ##ctic . The room was small and always a but mug ##gy ( poor air quality ) . Pa ##id too much in my opinion for what we got . I normally stay at ma ##riot ##t but made reservations with my daughters team . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I fell in love with the de ##cor of this hotel ! Great sized bathroom and loved sitting in the window seats and watching the city come to life at night . I even bought a awesome robe after my stay because it was so cute ! Can ' t wait to go back soon one day ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I absolutely love this hotel , and the main reason is Kay . The rooms are great too , but what a g ##em Kay is ! I was so excited to see that she was still with the hotel after all of the changes . From check - in to check - out , she makes every dollar worth the stay ! Except ##ional service , very tentative , pleasant attitude , and Kay value ' s her customers , her interactions with me let me know . I appreciate good service but love great service and great service is what I always get from Kay when I stay here . I just hope I get to see her more , now that Illinois is opening up . This hotel has become my choice hotel when I travel to Chicago , because of this magnificent young lady . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything was great especially at the breakfast area Brittany was very at ##ten ##tive and always smiling , she made me feel welcome , you are lucky to have her my only des ##ap ##point ##ment was the Internet connection the worst [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay at this hotel ! I was clean , comfortable , and virtually everything that you could ever need was located within the building itself . I stayed in a double room with a friend that , to our great surprise , only had one bed ( not great ) , but everything else - - the mattress , the bathroom , the fridge - - were all good . One thing to note : virtually everything other than the room itself costs money . If you are not a Hilton Honors member , you must pay for W ##if ##i . You also must pay $ 15 per day to use the gym , unless you just want to run the track or swim in the pool . There were no water fountain ##s in the building that I could find , so it ' s either free sink water or expensive bottle ##d water . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall the s ##tat was pleasant , but a few issues caused in ##con ##ven ##ience ##s . The staff did the best they could and tried hard . The location was great . I was part of a family reunion and the staff accommodate ##d us well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Ambassador hotel was beyond beautiful , and super clean . From Francisco at the front to help with our luggage to B ##re at the desk giving the best local recommendations , and city tips , this place was a pet friendly dream . My husband and I were traveling across country with our dog and this place treated us so well . They greeted my s ##ch ##na ##uze ##r with an AD ##OR ##AB ##LE pet good ##ie bag , complete with an ‘ I love Chicago ’ toy , treats , and some other treasures . The hotel has so much history and charm , nestled in the sweet ##est walk ##able neighborhood . I could go on and on but You should see for yourself . Can ’ t wait to book a trip back ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is excellent . Bell service is excellent . Front desk service poor . No parking , directed to private lot for $ 55 / day . No room service . Ex ##er ##cise room looks good , P ##elo ##ton does not work . Two el ##liptic ##als out of order . Room te ##mp control was poor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m a huge Kim ##pton fan already - - but I have to say my recent stay at Hotel Monaco exceeded my expectations . First of all - - when I checked in I was five minutes shy of the the end of the wine hour . The front desk staff wanted to make sure I got a glass of wine / hot to ##ddy immediately ! My room was perfect - - and very comfortable . But the best part was the window - seat with a spectacular view of Chicago & Marina City ( Co ##rn Co ##bs ) . Large windows allowed me to so ##ak in the city . . . which I love so . While in Chicago , I was not well ( cold ) - - and the front staff took care of me by making sure I had hot water in the evening to make tea / so ##oth ##e my throat . They couldn ' t have been more helpful . All in all - - one of my favorite Kim ##pton ' s ! I will definitely stay there again soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a person who travels frequently to Chicago for business , this is always my preferred hotel . The location on Michigan Avenue is perfect ; the dining , shopping and sights ##ee ##ing is wonderful from here ( don ' t miss Navy Pier ! ) . The rooms are quiet and room ##y , most have bedrooms separate from the living room area with a work ##able desk ~ perfect for those traveling on business . Staff is very friendly and helpful . Two thumbs up ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was great , rooms were great . My only thing I could say is it would be nice to see small fridge ##s in the room for left ##overs or cold drinks if possible . I happen to be the room closest to the elevator so I think I got a little more noise than most but was not that bad . Everything else was great as always ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a conference here and the venue was very good . There are many dining and bar options available and a nice market to buy snack ##s , coffee and water . Overall a nice hotel experience and location was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##abulous staff , lovely rooms with the best beds in town , perfect location . . . . What ' s not to love ? Oh , and reasonable prices . I don ' t stay anywhere else in Chicago . Very easy access to public transportation . If you don ' t have a coffee pot in your room , ask and they ' ll bring you one . Thanks , David ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a very good hotel . It was ideal ##ly located as a base for all our activities in Chicago . The room was clean and quiet , the beds were comfortable . We loved the q ##ui ##rky window seats and it had a great view of the river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Except the elevators , everything was good . I really enjoyed the Evening Social ##s and the breakfast . The internet speed was also good . The constant unpleasant smell in the hallway ##s was little bit down ##side . As mentioned above , the elevators were horrible . There were even times I waited for 5 minutes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . Close to everything and the con ##cier ##ge was helpful finding age appropriate events for our kids . We walked to most restaurants and Navy Pier . Most the museums were within a 5 minute U ##ber or the public bus which was more like 25 minutes but inexpensive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Beautiful , historic hotel in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods ! Walking distance to theatres , shopping , museums and the lake . Can ' t wait to go back , such a lovely , lovely hotel . Do yourself a favor ! ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The entire experience of excellence , service and kindness was outstanding The rooms were of a great standard and the food was beautifully presented . I had a d ##8 ##ff ##uc ##ult ##y with the loss if my iPhone and the staff were nothing short if a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful sights ##ee ##ing trip . Service couldn ' t have been better . Don ' t miss Macy ' s on State Street for the shopping and window decorations or the Odyssey River lunch cruise ( food and service imp ##ec ##ca ##ble ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always consistent , always take great care of us and a f ##abulous property ! Sales and event staff - can ' t say enough . They are a true partner and always anti ##ci ##pate our needs . As a meeting plan ##ner , this is one of my favorite hotels - and we book across the county and globally , daily . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived in Chicago super late last Friday , and the place we booked through Air ##b ##n ##b was below expectations . We decided to leave and find a nearby hotel at the last minute . We were so fortunate to find the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . We ended up getting a great rate , our room was clean , com ##fy , and quiet . It was everything we needed for our long weekend get ##away . The location is excellent - being a little north pushed us to explore the Gold Coast and Old Town , where you can find great restaurants . It was just steps away from Michigan a Avenue too , the more tourist ##y area . The one complaint I have about the hotel is they don ' t seem to have enough staff at the front desk . Several times when we tried to call no one answered or we were placed on a long hold . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice hotel located convenient ##ly to shopping and restaurants . Walking distance to lots of fun things and great shopping . We ate at the restaurant 67 ##6 and it was very good with great service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed there 4 nights . It was a very good experience from check - in to check - out . A few blocks from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and downtown best shopping . Close to ups ##cale and popular restaurants . Si ##ze of rooms is adequate . Dec ##oration is taste ##ful . Personnel is efficient and disc ##reet . Free c ##rois ##san ##ts and coffee are a bonus if you don ' t feel in need of a full breakfast . Value for money is correct . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we are " frequent fly ##ers " at the So ##fit ##el because it never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s ! We make sure we stay there every time we can . The rooms are clean , service is incredibly friendly , the restaurant is wonderful . . . what more can I say ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 4 days and the room was never cleaned ! It is kind of gross to live in a hotel room with kids and have no cleaning done at all . Please clean the room at least once day , so it feel pleasant to stay in your hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was absolutely perfect for our stay . The location was great for tourist gal ##liva ##ntin ##g and the staff were wonderful . Am ##er and Ash were nothing short of AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! They held our luggage when we came to the city early ( and after we checked out ) and made me feel incredibly welcomed , appreciated and safe . We passed by many times and they remembered our names and had genuine , caring conversations ( as time allowed ) - - they are an asset and a big reason I would choose this hotel again ( and highly recommended it ) . Thank you for the wonderful hospitality ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at Public Chicago for 9 nights . We attended a family party , White Sox game , Boom ##ers game , visited the Polish Museum , went on the Pro ##hibition Pub Tour and saw The King and I at the Oriental Theatre . All of this on public transportation or U ##ber . Great not to worry about parking or traffic ! Travis Howard , the Assistant Front Office Manager took excellent care of us . He made sure we had a wonderful room and was always available to help us out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I originally scheduled my visit , I was looking forward to my stay . However I was sore ##ly disappointed in the service I received . Check ##ing in was a disaster and was given such an attitude . I guess because I found my trip on a third party site , you get treated like s ##cum . . the room size was so small that the t ##v was right in front of us . For the amount we paid , our receiving end was so bad . The only thing good about that place was the location . That ’ s it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A manager , Ki ##a , got me out of a bind by printing my trans ##cript for an interview free of charge . The business center was closed so the only way to get something printed for an interview in the morning was to have it printed at the front desk . It was really helpful and ultimately got me the job . Thanks Ki ##a ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have always loved this hotel . It needs renovation - - in nearly every corner . Why are they letting it de ##ter ##ior ##ate like this ? They ' re re ##nova ##ting the lobby ceiling and the pool , so perhaps they ' re starting to get in front of it . My room and the hallway ##s were ta ##ttered and worn . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our firm hosted an all - day meeting at this hotel for 75 - 80 people . Our catering sales manager , Ya ##vis Soto , is the best ! She anticipated details and offered alternatives . She is a pro ! The banquet staff was on top of everything and worked with our schedule changes . The food was wonderful . We also utilized the in - house A ##V company , PS ##AV . Chris Hamilton and Joshua were re ##sp ##ons ##ive , the equipment was set - up well and they came to check on us . The sleeping rooms have just been renovated , they are beautiful , the views are great and the best of all , they are so clean ! If you are coordinating an event , don ' t look anywhere else ! [SEP]

She is wonderful and any one would be lucky to have her as their housekeeper . J ##OE ##Y F ##RE ##DE ##L . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was looking forward to the hotel very much but I was disappointed how s ##hab ##by the rooms are . Room ##s are tiny , door to rest ##room does not close , stain ##s on the wall etc . There is always a long line for checking - in . The only decorative part is the lobby which is too large , with loud crowd always . The only positive experience with the hotel is its location . Too p ##ric ##y for the service it offers . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is the second time we have stayed at the Intercontinental . Amazing customer service ! ! ! Close to everything ! Very nice room . This will be our “ go to ” hotel for Chicago . Be ##come an Ambassador , well worth it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is clean and very nice . Only big issue was the internet did not work while we were there . Room ##s are big for downtown Chicago and very clean . Breakfast and Evening Social had good food . Nice to have and did not have to find a place to eat . I would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The v ##ibe of this hotel is definitely one of its main attractions , including the lobby and also the design of the rooms . The rooms have been renovated and it shows as soon as you walk into the room . However , the age of this hotel also reveals itself at night when you hear the music and the talking . The walls are definitely still too thin and there ’ s nothing really they can do about it . Overall a great experience but wouldn ’ t say it ’ s the perfect hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] De ##fin ##ite ##ly one of the most memorable hotels in all my travels . . . from the most beautiful lo ##bb ##ies I have seen to the quality bed that provided complete rest ##ful sleep I cannot recommend enough just how enjoyable my experience was with this wonderful hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you ever need a hotel recommendation in Chicago , I H ##IG ##HL ##Y recommend Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Can ' t find one negative thing to say at all , room was a good size , excellent bed and pillows , shower and bath are awesome , free continental breakfast offered on each floor , free cocktail and app ##eti ##zers and dessert each night . They offer a con ##cier ##ge text ##ing service , just text them a question and they reply back with any t ##id ##bit of info you need . Excellent location , seriously could not have asked for anything , this place is fantastic ! [UNK] located at Ken ##zie & State , one block from the River ##walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying here , but it won ' t be the last . The room was clean and room ##y , the bed ##ding was amazing and the room temperature could be controlled to the perfect temperature . The pool is a must see ( a must swim ! ) . Location was awesome and very walk - able to shops , restaurants and the Chicago river . Can ' t wait to go back ! [SEP]

Then , 2 more family member p ##cs tried to log - in . This created bandwidth problem . And none of us were streaming . E ##asily slow ##est / most complicated w ##i - fi of the dozen hotels i ' ve been to in ch ##ica ##go . To top it off , despite the renovated rooms , the air / water quality was so poor , I got sick . Check ##ed out and when somewhere else . Re ##com ##men ##d you do the same . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a great stay here as a family for a few days running around Chicago . They still kept a lot of the historic architecture and features in the building which gave it a great experience . Only a few blocks from major attractions was nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very excited for weekend in Chicago with my wife . We try to get up there a few times a year . Christmas time is our favorite . We have stayed at multiple hotels up there over the years . This was our first and last time at the H ##ya ##tt . Re ##quest ##ed early check in . They said that they would call to update us . . . . . they did not . At 4 ##pm they said that they might have our room ready . Came up to a total crap hole . Pictures worth a thousand words . We were told to come back in an hour or so . Told that they were “ just under staffed ” . Car ##pet full of stain ##s . Fi ##lt ##hy . Had to wear shoes the entire stay IN O ##UR $ 400 / night top of room . T ##ip from us is to stay at the Sheridan or Embassy . . . . or anywhere but the H ##ya ##tt . I have no clue why reviews were so good for this place . [SEP]

1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location . I loved the grocery store , park and restaurants right behind the hotel . You did not feel like you were in the city . I was a little disappointed with the hotel as price ##y as it is . No pool , no rooftop deck and NO outside seating at all . The staff was nice and the rooms were clean . The elevator behave ##d while I was there , I had seen so many reviews on waiting times . The hotel was full when we there and I never had to wait long . If returning to Chicago , I would most likely seek out another hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed in this property ten times in the last 8 years . All the stays were very good . Unfortunately , my last stay was not at all as good as the pat stays at So ##fit ##el Chicago . Too many issues during my stay which really ruined my 3 nights at the property . Food quality has dropped and house ##keeping has rooms for improvement . I conveyed my concerns to management , but it was too late , as our last night was really terrible and ended our vacation on a bad note . I hope the hotel ' s management could take back this property to its better days . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at the Fair ##mont Chicago whilst in the city for the marathon . This hotel is fantastic !

Would stay here again for sure ! [SEP]

Upon arrival we were immediately assisted by the awesome bell ##man and our check in experience we warm and helpful . Guest room was H ##U ##GE with H ##U ##GE windows overlooking the city , pay the extra for the corner king room ! The cocktail reception was outstanding , really enjoyed the convenience . Breakfast is served daily on the landing of each floor , great selection and so convenient . Did I mention location ? Wow this Hotel is in the middle of River North exactly where you want to be for food and convenience to downtown . Overall the experience was five star and can ' t wait to return ! [SEP]

0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Chicago Hotel is a typically big am ##eric ##an hotel with very warm people working in it . The room was very good with lot ' s of space and the bathroom was very clean and with a good l ##igh ##ing . I would have liked if the shower had a bit more water pressure . The location is perfect right on the magnificent mile and a walking distance from the Art Institute of Chicago and the Mill ##eni ##um Park . Both are a must see if you are in Chicago . One suggestion is to walk on Chicago streets look ##in upwards . You will be delighted by the different and beautiful architecture of the buildings . After a long day you will feel comfortable in your silent room at the O ##m ##ni . Perfect for a good night of sleep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ki ##nz ##ie over Thanksgiving and we were pleasant ##ly surprised from the moment we arrived . The day door man was exceeding ##ly court ##eous and helpful . The front desk staff was always ready to help in anyway . We were able to get our room earlier , as well we were given a late check ##out . Room ##s were very clean , beds comfortable and the daily breakfast was great . I was also impressed at the happy hour they have for their guests night ##ly with token ##s for free cocktail ##s and finger foods . Location was perfect , walking distance to most attractions . Would definitely stay here again . [UNK] [SEP]

( We were thrilled to be allowed to check in early . ) Our 8 year old grandson was thrilled by our room on the 28th floor were we enjoyed an excellent view of the city . Just be aware , there are two sets of elevators and they serve different floors . The pool also offered a great view of the city . We will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had an excellent stay with my girlfriend having all but one of our expectations were met . The staff was court ##eous and helpful with quick service . The breakfast room service was a little lack ##luster and was my only complaint [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved our stay at the So ##fit ##el . The room was luxurious with very comfortable bed and pillows . The staff were a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and made every effort to see that we enjoyed our stay . The view was incredible and the location was perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Te ##rik B . is an amazing front desk clerk , it was our anniversary and he upgraded our room for free to a view of Navy Pier . The hotel was amazing and save for the $ 55 dollars a night parking , the stay was fl ##aw ##less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one night and we loved it . Room was very nice and the bed felt like heaven . We upgraded from a king to a higher up room with king . Very clean room with a tub shower comb ##o bathroom . Stay ##ed on the 29th floor and had a great view of the city . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##est ##hetical ##ly plea ##sing lobby and location , but the per ##ks end there . We were visiting for a friends wedding . My wife made the reservation and we arrived separately . Even though I was added to the reservation , they would not give me a key because we had different last names ? I had to show a confirmation email . S ##light ##ly in ##com ##pet ##ent but no big deal . The room was s ##nu ##g , towels poor quality , the bed was essentially on the floor , and service me ##dio ##cre . Room had not been cleaned by 3 : 30 pm on Saturday . Was charged $ 1 . 50 for printing out a boarding pass . Just overall petty and over ##p ##rice ##d , especially given the p ##let ##hora of Chicago hotels , would not stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing special , out ##dated hotel with a weak gym . Breakfast is highly disappointing as is the evening offer . Do anti ##ci ##pate using either . Location is nice but just a block away is a row of homeless , perhaps that is a bigger issue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel for Michigan mile in Chicago . Check until out very nice , well kept , staff were pleasant and efficient . Good location to everything . Michael Jordan restaurant and bar was inside hotel . Only draw ##back , elevators to small . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I checked in under the Fair ##mont Gold package . Man ##dan ##a was very at ##ten ##tive at breakfast and Jesus followed up in the evening with cord ##ial ##s and snack ##s . Man ##dan ##a was great at suggesting places to visit during my stay and reminded me of amenities in the hotel . I will be certain to book the Fair ##mont Chicago again should I travel to town for business or pleasure again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed here as was attending a conference here . Very comfortable room , nice staff , excellent food and drinks ! ! ! This hotel is also in a great location in Chicago . En ##joy ##ed my stay ! The only disappointing part was the rooms weren ’ t ready when we arrived which was understand ##able since it was 12 : 00 pm , although when the conference ended the first day , there were so many of us trying to check in and not enough staff . This was booked so far in advance that I think the hotel could have planned better . The accommodation ##s , food & staff were fantastic though ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great - Walking distance from most of the major attractions , amazing view of the river from the room . But very basic amenities like exhaust fan in the bathroom were missing . Also , they refused to provide air fresh ##ener ##s despite request . The w ##if ##i was also erratic and kept disco ##nne ##cting frequently . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location ! You can walk to shopping and Millennium Park . The hotel is very clean and Co ##vid safe . Friendly staff , excellent food in the restaurant and super comfortable beds . I will stay here every time I visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What can say ? ! What a ma ##rve ##llo ##us hotel . Spa ##cious , clean and com ##fy rooms with great views of the city . Also , rooms seem to be nice and quiet , which is always good if you have to rest . Can ’ t wait to check out the gym on my next visit . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel ' s lobby , ballroom , and restaurants are beautiful and worth coming in and of themselves . But just for a drink or some food . Like a lot of great old hotels in big American cities , the rooms just aren ' t designed for modern se ##ns ##ibi ##lities or standards . They ' re quite small , especially the bathroom ##s where it feels quite like taking a shower in a closet . The windows aren ' t double - pan ##ed , as far as I can tell , meaning on cold winter nights you really have to c ##rank the heat to stay comfortable . If your room is designed to be able to ad ##join another room , you ' ll be able to see light from the other room in the dark and hear everything your neighbors are saying . The upside , if any , is at least the rooms aren ' t all that expensive . Ex ##pect ##ed more , though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoy my stay . Everyone was professional and on point . I stayed at the hotel for 3 days , 2 nights . Getting a room was easy as he staff on the phone were very friendly and quick to answer all my questions . The hotel was clean and well kept . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I found the Ki ##nz ##ie through Book ##ing . com - what a find . I stayed on the 6th floor - breakfast was served b ##uff ##et style outside of my room . In the evening " Happy Hour " was also on the 6th floor which included free drinks and substantial app ##eti ##zers . The Ki ##nz ##ie hotel is located close to the Ma ##gni ##fica ##nt Mile , restaurants , night ##life , etc . My room was large , beautifully appointed , and quiet . I will def ##inate ##ly be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were well taken care of from start to check ##out . Lake ##ish ##a upgraded our room to a room with a view in light of the fact it was our 4 year anniversary . She was so kind and welcoming . We would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a get ##away weekend and had a wonderful stay . The location was within walking distance of everything we wanted to do . The service is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . The room was amazing ##ly quiet considering you are staying on one of the busiest streets in America . The only thing that was not a 5 star was the room ( which is still a 4 star ) , because it was a little bit worn — but exceptionally clean . We would recommend this hotel for singles , couples , and families . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pol ##ite and friendly staff rooms were spacious only missing item is there is only 1 place to eat . It was good but limiting . My family had a good time and it was central ##ly located and easy to get around [SEP]

1	[CLS] # AA ##NA ##con ##g ##ress ##20 ##19 was da bomb partly because of the location and wonderful amenities of this hotel . Initially my room was smoke filled . I requested a change which was promptly accomplished . The view from my room was great . High ##ly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel ! The rooms were very clean and loved the bathroom ##s had dual sinks , so we could both get ready at the same time . It was a little noisy hearing the sire ##ns throughout the night ; otherwise , everything was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent the night in Chicago and stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie . Very nice a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s . Price was very reasonable . Area was a bit busy but it was a great warm weekend and everyone was out . Will be back to this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the O ##m ##ni ! We had a 1 bedroom suite on the 25th floor with a huge bathroom ! ! Although situated close to the elevators , it was nice and quiet ! House ##keeping was wonderful and accommodate ##d my requests . We booked through American Express travel and received a $ 75 Hotel Collection v ##ou ##cher for breakfast in the 67 ##6 Restaurant . The b ##uff ##et was absolutely amazing ! ! ! The location is central to everything and easy to walk to nearby tourist attractions or hop on the train to W ##rig ##ley Field ! We will miss the friendly v ##alet guys greeting us each time we came and went . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is amazing , f ##abulous art de ##cor with funk ##y music and genuine staff . Check ##ed in here only to impressed at every step by polite , funny , kind people . Great place , totally made to feel welcome . The rooms are kit ##ted with every ##th ##ong you could want and a huge bed [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 3 nights over super bowl weekend . Service was efficient and professional . Our room was clean and well - appointed . The view from the corner suite was fantastic . We enjoyed the full b ##uff ##et every morning . The fitness center was huge offering everything one might need for a full work ##out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel atmosphere was amazing . Right when you walk in the lobby is very class ##y , with their tea br ##unch thing going on everyday . Room ##s are spacious , location of the hotel is right in the middle of action . Love ##d everything about my stay including the friendly staff . [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our overall experience for our 2 day visit to Chicago was made even better by the excellent service we received here . The entire staff was very friendly and helpful , but we would like to extend a special thank you to Joshua , Victoria and Kendall who went above and beyond the normal excellent customer service standards that you probably expect from your employees . Every member of the v ##alet parking team also provided excellent service and were very friendly . I would highly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]

Staff is very friendly . In the middle of the magnificent mile shopping strip . Love ##d my stay ! Would book again ! And will recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand took great care of me during a recent business trip . The staff was kind and helpful . The sensor on the mini bar was a bit much . AS an adult , it was no problem . But as a father of 4 children , we could never stay here as the 3 year old would have no self control . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was an awesome hotel . The location is superb and a convenient walk to most places . The room was very clean , spacious and modern ##ly decorated . You can tell the staff put customer service at the top of the priority list . My wife and I would definitely stay here again for any future trips to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] When I inquired about the fact that the room smelled like s ##tale perfume , I was told that their house ##keeping service utilizes f ##rag ##rance filled powder ##s and air fresh ##ener ##s when they clean . I haven ’ t experienced this with a hotel or motel recently . The kindly moved me to others rooms , but they all had the same issue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone was very helpful with our little dog ( very pet friendly ) . Hotel is well placed for early / late river ##front walks . Beautiful and private . Con ##cier ##ge Marissa De Fe ##lice was very helpful with booking ##s and a pleasure to deal with . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , breakfast had great steal cut o ##at ##me ##al and g ##rano ##la , gym was big and equipment was great , the room was clean , comfortable , and the location was close enough to everything . Staff was friendly and delivered , we will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and I stayed in this hotel for a long weekend . It was my first visit to Chicago and overall , a wonderful trip . This hotel has an elegant lobby and large rooms ; our closet ##s were huge . The rooms are a bit dated and our shower didn ' t drain well , but everything was spot ##less and so quiet for sleeping . When I called about a couple minor things , help was sent immediately . The staff is both pleasant and helpful . Room ##s are moderately priced based on the city and location . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My team and I had a great visit thanks to Emily and Barbara . Emily showed such great hospitality and made us feel welcome and appreciated . Barbara took such great care of is at the hospitality hour which was great . The rooms were clean , updated and spacious . I couldn ' t have asked for a better experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We L ##O ##VE Kim ##pton ##s and have stayed at all the Chicago locations . Big ##ges ##t draw ##back to the Monaco is if you have a car - no real drive up area ; and getting car from v ##alet in mornings takes extremely long ( even with the text first option , still took 20 min ##s which is too long ) . Staff is awesome : front desk couldn ' t be nice ##r and door ##men amazing . Room ##s are clean - ask for a river view on a high floor ! The window seats are such a unique feature to this hotel . Thank you for another wonderful trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel . Well appointed . Fun v ##ibe . Co ##m ##fy beds with quiet room . Nice service . Like ##d the wine and coffee in the lobby . Mass ##ively over ##p ##rice ##d parking , so find a garage around the corner using Spot Hero . Limited on site amenities . Great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent one night here as part of a cross - country Amtrak trip , west ##bound . It ' s a nice hotel with nice people , and clean . But . . . There ' s a mini ##bar fridge in the room that wasn ' t cold enough - my wife couldn ' t drink the Coke . It was also noisy whenever the com ##press ##or came on . The bed was a good bed but it had a soft mattress cover under the sheets that I couldn ' t get comfortable on . The climate control was pretty tightly wound - the cooling fan came on with an Arctic blast with surprising frequency . The shower was nice , but with too little water pressure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] nice hotel at a reasonable price . . room took a little while to get ready but we arrived on a sun ##day morning and they were busy . . room is modern and comfortable . . bar was good . . great t ##v in the room . . . no bath ##tub ##s which is a negative [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Public hotel is wonderful retreat ! Great location in the heart of the Gold Coast with a neighborhood feel yet steps from the bust ##ling night ##life . En ##joy a quiet & peaceful night sleep while being just 3 blocks from fine dining ; Gibson ##s , Tavern , & just 4 blocks away from Bloom ##ing ##dale ##s & the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! It was so great to be so close to everything I wanted to be but come " home " to a quiet place to rest . Public will be my go to stay . The staff could not have been more helpful & friendly from the moment I arrived until I left . Food at the pump room is phenomena ##l . Public feels more like a residence then the commercial ##ized generic feel which you typically find at a hotel . Book your stay today ! You won ' t be disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was a wonderful experience staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel . From the check - in to the check ##out every person I came into contact with was very pleasant and persona ##ble . The room was comfortable and clean . The continental breakfast on every floor made it quick and easy for me to grab and go to my room to relax and enjoy it . Will definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay was te ##rri ##fic and service levels from check in , breakfast ( s ##c ##rump ##ti ##ous ) and house ##keeping where top level . The bell captains were professional , helpful and friendly ! My room was huge and comfortable ! Great stay in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . In the middle of everything . Staff excellent . Very clean . Small hotel , with personal service . Would definitely recommend . Price ##d well for the location . We had at least 20 family members staying at the hotel for a wedding and every one was please with the accommodation ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Great Vale ##t parking . I enjoyed the pool and the fitness center . Every ##day they used to bring cookies and milk for my kids . I had bad night sleep because of the pillows . Need to work more on cleaning the rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always love staying at The Ambassador every time we visit Chicago . Central ##ly located to everything we do . Minutes walk to the Lake and the red ##line . Staff and clean ##liness of the rooms is always a plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel itself is very nice , but unfortunately we did not have the best interactions with the front desk staff . The library and lobby are inviting and well - decorated . The rooms are modern and sleek . I really wish the front desk staff was more welcoming and had better training . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel had everything to offer that we needed . Star ##bu ##cks on street level , shopping and restaurants around the corner . Central ##ly located to everything we planned to do in Chicago . Only down ##side was the pool was closed . I recommend pre - paid parking in the Millennium Park garage ##s . Short walk to the hotel and it will save you a lot of money . We will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t is a wonderful venue in downtown Chicago . The staff is awesome , helpful and very professional . I can heart ##ily recommend this hotel . It truly exceeded my expectations . The location was very convenient . The restaurant in the hotel served wonderful food . The beds were com ##fy . The bathroom ##s were well equipped . The Talbot ##t is a g ##em . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I enjoyed our stay in this bout ##ique hotel . The room was spacious , the bed was very comfortable , the breakfast filling the management reserved and not very interested in interacting with a couple of seniors . The price was right and we ' ll probably consider staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This a great hotel , with great customer service . The rooms were very clean and beds comfortable . Perhaps the best part is that a V ##ER ##Y good breakfast is served at every floor . You take a tray from your room , walk down the hall , get your food and enjoy it in your room . The t ##read ##mill ##s were great for when I wanted to get a run in . I highly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff , very good food , only issue was the sire ##ns from the nearby hospital . Location otherwise was perfect . Easy to get around as cab ##s are always out front . Lots of good restaurants close , within easy walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at the Fair ##mont for a corporate event . The staff took amazing care of us , especially Nina Mo ##ff ##a and Yo ##land ##a A ##voy ##tes who made sure our entire company had the rooms they needed plus a ton of extra work they had to do before we even got there . I have already planned on taking a personal trip back and will stay at the Fair ##mont . The location is so ##oo ##o nice . literally walking distance from so ##o much , right across the street from Mill ##eni ##um Park . Beautiful sky ##line and lake views as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed 6 nights here and were very impressed . Excellent location , staff all helpful and friendly , good bar / restaurant overlooking Michigan Ave . The room was large , with separate sitting room , comfortable and good furniture and fitting ##s . Clean , good heating and A / C . Bath ##room was fine with all facilities . One minor criticism - the w ##if ##i was a bit patch ##y and often dropped out , needing to log ##in multiple times . Make sure you belong to Select Guest loyalty programme ( free , online ) for free w ##if ##i . Overall , highly recommended . [SEP]
0	[CLS] i found that the food was way over ##p ##rice ##d otherwise just the complete stay was average . Was expecting better overall for that kind of hotel and especially with the room priced . Breakfast at over 30 dollars for the limited food is too much . Better not leave your table at breakfast to get something else , the waiter ##s will clean it up within 30 seconds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay @ the Ki ##nz ##ie . I was especially impressed with the staff . The local hotel workers union was demonstrating at several hotels the weekend I visited . When I first entered our room , and discovered the pick ##eter ##s were audible from the room - - we requested a room change and the staff responded immediately . They were extremely helpful with directions and always remembered our names , which I appreciate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at the Monaco a number of times while attending training classes at my company . I ' ve AL ##WA ##Y ##S been pleased . The staff is excellent . En ##ga ##ged , helpful , friendly - I can ' t say enough about them . They alone are a reason to return . The rooms are fun and a bit funk ##y - what I expect from a Kim ##pton property . And they are spacious . Not just spacious for a downtown property , they are truly spacious . The lobby is not huge , but it is nicely appointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t do it . There are plenty of hotels , many cheaper . But spend more so you don ' t have to put up with the old r ##adia ##tors . They are so noisy , whether on heat or cool , that it is impossible to sleep . Windows don ' t open , so you need to have the r ##adia ##tor on all night . Additionally , the hotel need up ##dating and smells of damp . And the rooms are small . And breakfast is very , very expensive , and crap ( $ 25 per person ? ) . A / C noise is terrible on floor 17 ! ! ! Staff nice , but avoid ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here on several occasions and have enjoyed it ! My husband got to experience the Monaco this time and he too was impressed . We arrived in Chicago from New Orleans by train early ( 10 AM ) Sunday morning and our room was ready when we arrived . After a nap , and a bite to eat , we noticed that our in - room safe was ma ##lf ##un ##ction ##ing . A call to the desk sent Glenn the engineer to visit . He arrived promptly and assessed that the unit was bad . He returned Monday morning to install a brand new unit . You expect this type of service on a cruise ship ( which we had the same problem occur this summer ) . Most hotels would tell you that they had no one on site to deal with this at this hour ( 8 : 30 PM ) and that it would have to wait until Monday . Love my " pet fish " in the room , too ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had a great visit to Chicago and the service at the hotel was excellent . All the staff were very friendly and helpful . I found that the hotel reached out in numerous different ways to make sure my stay was satisfactory . Really enjoyed my time at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and staff was f ##abulous ! Walk ##ed out front door onto Ma ##g Mike . Lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance . Michael Jordan ##s restaurant and Star ##bu ##cks in lobby were great too ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a business trip so I did not see the bill ##ing to determine costs . The room was comfortable , the bathroom was quite small and the sink was a designer type which was okay . The staff was always pleasant for whatever questions the group had , which were not many . It is located in a good part of town and we walked to the various locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 1st time visit . Great place to stay ( and shop ) . Food was very good . Love ##d the bar And atmosphere after a long day . No matter what employee you met around the hotel , they all said hello and asked how you were doing . Very friendly place . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first visit to the US . It is for a conference hosted at the five star Fair ##mont in Chicago . What impressed me was the location in the city centre . The hotel is huge with towering views . Other than that the experience was average , if not a let ##down considering the price that I paid . The first floor lobby was un ##int ##ere ##sting and under ##sta ##ffed . The room was decent , but again did not blow me away . There was no turn - down service where someone visited your room before bed - time to neat ##en up and leave a small surprise . Overall it felt like a sa ##usage machine , where you go in and get out . I experienced little personal attention . I cannot say if this was a US cultural phenomenon because it was my first visit to a hotel in the US . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a very old hotel but you can ' t beat the service , accommodation ##s , and price . This hotel is located in the perfect location in downtown Chicago on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . There is a cheap parking garage around the corner ( for $ 35 / day instead of $ 65 / day ) . The hotel is easy for taxi / U ##ber drivers to find , opposed to other hotels that are harder to access . The hotel is one block from the John Hancock tower and five blocks from Lou Mal ##nat ##i ' s ( the best Chicago pizza place ) . Again , the hotel is old so it only provides heat , not AC ; however , the front desk is more than willing to drop off a desk fan to c ##ir ##culate air in your room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room is very clean and comfortable and the staff answered all my questions upon my visit in the city . Great affordable price and being located right downtown . I would recommend Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for your next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were so happy to stay at the So ##fit ##el for our first visit to Chicago ! The location is wonderful , walking distance to great tourist attractions , shops and restaurants . The service is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble ! The rooms are nicely kept , comfortable and clean . The con ##cier ##ge was very nice and helpful , and we found the lobby bar to be delight ##ful for an evening cocktail ! It was the perfect stay for our fifteenth wedding anniversary ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What can you say nicely placed on Michigan Ave , and in Chicago . Close to all the best of Chicago . W ##lak ##ing distance to din ##ning and shop ##ing along with the sites of the city . Nice rest ##ura ##nt if you want to eat at a Mi ##chal ##e Jordan ##s , a bit p ##ric ##y but plenty of options near by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My friends and I planned a dinner and show in the city . We chose to stay at hotel Monaco . We could not have been more pleased . When we arrived they had a complementary wine hour in the lobby . While enjoying some wine , I noticed the hotel offered a bicycle if needed and dog bowls for your pet to grab a drink . The staff was so welcoming and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We were able to stay in a beautiful room with a view of the river . We were a few blocks away from the theater with great restaurants near by for dinner . After the show we headed back to the hotel for a drink at the hotel bar . The bar tender ##er was very persona ##ble and great to talk with . We had a great night . The Monaco staff and am ##bie ##nce makes this hotel a place I would love to visit again soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome location , outstanding well organized hotel , professional staff , and great service , swimming pool and fitness center are good treat , nice t ##idy rooms , nice restaurants and enjoyable lobby : memorable ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are SP ##G members who paid over $ 330 . a night and were disappointed for the first time with a She ##rato ##n hotel . . . We had reservations but there were no rooms available upon our arrival at 1 PM . We let them hold our luggage and went out to tour the city . The hotel is very well located . When we returned at 6 PM , we still had a wait ! Really un ##con ##s ##cion ##able . The room is fine though the pillows were flat and we had to request different ones . There was no shower cap and we have had better s ##ham ##po ##o and body lot ##ions in Hampton Inn ##s . I do want to compliment the staff in the 33rd floor lounge . They are at ##ten ##tive and the food is great ! Otherwise , this hotel was an expensive mistake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lots of money in the lobby de ##cor and bar . Think about using it for the rooms . Te ##mp control for one , poor mattress , rooms only fair in clean ##liness and need updated . Broken bed for 2 nights of stay . House ##keeping knocks on door is starting to open the door to come in before 10 am . Tell guests time ##frame to expect housekeeper ##s . All staff made good eye contact and were friendly . Think about adding staff to food ma ##rt during high volume times to eliminate lines . Location is convenient but hotel is not the best Chicago has to offer for the room fee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Oh boy . . . . . . where do I start ? Hotel is a massive convention machine and it looks and functions like an airport . There is nothing about it that it will bring me back . As a Platinum SP ##G member there was no recognition nor upgrade . Si ##mp ##ly nothing at all . Room ##s are very old and very poorly appointed . Just out ##dated and very 70 ' s . Service is Z ##ER ##O . Everyone was always on computer and their personal devices , so even if you wanted to make an eye contact you could not and if you attempted staff acted irritated . Un ##believable . Room clean ##liness was terrible . Bath ##room was full of hair and coffee stain ##s all over . I could not wait to check out . I wish I asked for a re ##fu ##nd and checked out . I would have but staff would be annoyed to assist as they were probably on their phones . Never again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nicole was so helpful and friendly . I had quite a few que ##ries regarding my group and Nicole spent a lot of time helping me . She was such a lovely person and so happy to help . She ’ s a credit to your hotel ! Thank you so much for all of your help Nicole you ’ re a star ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great room , as I expected from the She ##rato ##n , great location on the river , I loved the river walk & close to all the highlights of Chicago . The service was good and I had no problems checking in or out . I love Chicago , so I try to experience different high end hotel every trip , but I would book here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came into the city to celebrate our Wedding . After reviewing a lot of Hotels in the area we decided to stay at Monaco . The Hotel was clean and staff was friendly . The happy hour from 5 ##pm - 6 ##pm was a nice touch . We had river view and the window seat was the highlight of our stay . While making our reservation we did indicate we were getting married . I want to be clear I don ' t expect free ##bies , but it would have been nice if it would have been acknowledged . Overall we enjoyed our stay , but with all the hotel options in such a great city I would try other hotels before we came back to Hotel Monaco . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was a great option for our recent trip to Lo ##lla ##pal ##oo ##za . We booked through a Lo ##lla package - - but upon arrival the hotel offered us an upgrade for a small additional amount . We ended up with a room overlooking the city sky ##line to the south , Lake Michigan and the Chicago River . That view , by the way , included the T - Mobile stage at Lo ##lla . A pool would have been a nice addition , but otherwise this hotel gave us an excellent experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The smaller property is in a great location close to dining , shopping and night ##life . Suite looked like it was re ##mo ##del ##ed in the past couple of years and are very neat and clean . The only suggestion would be to get a lower number suite on a higher floor to avoid street noise . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A smaller size hotel ( quiet ) with fantastic location to all the major shops and re ##ta ##ura ##nts . It has all the amenities a hotel needs and the employ ##es are all very friendly and some have been in this hotel for years ( door ##man , con ##cier ##ge , weight ##ers . . . ) I come here once a year and some of them even recognize me upon arrival . T ##H ##is is a great hotel for business travelers , but also for families or couples . The even have special programmes for kids . . . Not sure if it ' s the visitors or the position of the 67 ##6 restaurant ( view to MA ##g mile ) - kids are never loud in this restaurant ; - ) . and did I mention that every room is a suite ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights for a business trip . The location was central so it was easy to meet clients and prospects with a quick U ##ber ride . Hotel staff were really nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I wouldn ' t recommend for families as the room wasn ' t very spacious but they might have suites . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is right in the middle of all the action in Chicago ! Corner suite was small but well designed and clean . Didn ' t get a chance to use the gym or swimming pool . Close to restaurants , shopping , sights ##ee ##ing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay for 4 nights - com ##fy beds , Reno ##vated suite with wonderful bathroom , Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Really enjoyed the use of free bikes provided by the hotel , along with bike lock and helmet too ! Best per ##k ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I wasn ' t looking forward to visiting Chicago in winter , but I was curious about my stay at Palmer House . No complaints , it was comfortable and reasonably priced . The public spaces are op ##ulent and the time I spent in the vaulted main lobby was very entertaining . Service at the bar and registration was excellent . I could easily walk to all of the locations I needed to visit . The room itself was quite dated . . . p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper , r ##ust spots on fixtures , etc . . . and to be honest , having multiple locked doors in the room leading to who knows where was not entirely rest ##ful . But at this price point for a stay in the Loop I ' ll return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The most wonderful aspect about this hotel is that it has rooms available with 2 separate bathroom ##s and closet ##s ( and double beds ) at no or minimal extra cost - - so great if you are sharing a room . I love that you can open the room windows , even in the bathroom , to get fresh air . The staff is very helpful : provided me a space heat ##er since only air conditioning was available ( given the season ) and excellent recommendations for walking the vicinity given time limitations . The history of the building is interesting also , although I don ' t particularly care for ornate and traditional de ##cor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great trip ! Staff was friendly and made everything easy . The location is right across from boat tours of the Chicago River so it was easy to access tourist attractions . Great location because it ' s in the heart of the city , but it ' s not too bust with traffic in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed at the Talbot ##t annually over the last 10 years . Always a pleasant stay ! Miss some of the “ old ” am ##bie ##nce , but still a great place to stay and a excellent location for shopping and outstanding restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was on nice nice with all basic ne ##cess ##ities . Was surprised that there were not USB ports in the room , just regular outlets . It was also very warm in the room . Air didn ’ t seem to adjust one way or the other . The rest of the hotel was adequately cool during this week ’ s heat wave . The service in the coffee shop was extremely fast compared to other places . Staff were all very nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The team at the Kim ##pton made the impossible happen for us ! There was a city ##wide event and virtually no rooms available but not only did this team make it happen - they made it happen in grand style ! Will definitely be going back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good hotel with good access to D ##T Chicago . The staff were helpful when I raised some concerns with the rooms being unacceptable . Check - in staff was not very pleasant , but they might be having a bad day at the time . All other service staff were very helpful and cooperative in changing the rooms when requested . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed four nights the week before Memorial day . It was a wonderful experience : we were upgraded and helped in every en ##qui ##ry by highly professional front desk agents such as Gabriel , G ##ism ##era ##it , Ken . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel , right in the middle of all the action , it ’ s a great location . Jason , the manager and hotel staff were f ##abulous , they looked after us really well . It was my birthday and they left a card in our room , signed by all the staff , nice touch . I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] stayed here from the 1st to the 6th November , very pleased with the hotel and the staff , was a great location for getting to every thing we wanted without having to jump in a cab or bus all the time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay at The Talbot ##t . Con ##ven ##ient location to shopping and restaurants , great am ##bian ##ce , quiet well appointed room , nice lobby bar scene , wonderful outdoor dining , and at ##ten ##tive staff . D ##wayne will take great care of you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon arrival into the lobby this Hotel was impressive . I would have booked a hotel like this however I was on a business trip and the company booked it for me . The lobby and reception check in area was massive and welcoming , The staff were all most helpful and willing to help out with any need . I found that that the lounge staff were also most friendly . My room was on the seventh floor and I must say there was not a view . However the room was luxurious and the bed and fur ##nish ##ing were great . Check out is a breeze and the coffee bar opens at 6 : 00 for you early rise ##rs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All the things one hopes for when staying in a hotel in the city : Beautiful room , lots of plug ##s that are easy to access to charge the p ##let ##hora of devices , lovely de ##cor , quiet room , lots of hot water , and ( most importantly ) a comfortable bed . . . . and the location didn ' t hurt either . This was my second stay at this hotel while traveling through Chi - town for business . And will do so again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly check - in and pro ##mpt service . Hotel upgraded us to river view room that included a window seat overlooking the river . Great touch ! Fruit basket and water for breakfast , free NY ##T newspaper and coffee . Ad ##ja ##cent restaurant for more heart ##y breakfast ##s and friendly service . Love this location , walking distance to Ma ##g Mile , Millennium Park , AI ##C and so much more . I recommend this hotel and keep going back as the brand is consistently good in the 3 different cities I ' ve stayed in . Thanks , Kim ##pton Monaco ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We paid for a big suite and we got that , but the rest fell well below expectation . Service was awful . A ##rri ##val was in ##fu ##ria ##ting . We arrived around 5 pm and our room was not ready . Had to wait an hour in the lobby area to get our room ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great room which is so much larger than the one we stayed in NY and it is located not too far from the shopping area which is con ##ve ##inen ##t . Room is modern clean spacious room which we loved but view of parking lot next door which is not a good , possibly due the floor we stayed is low . We were planning to take a nice bath that we chose a hotel with the bath tub but unfortunately , bath tub is too shallow for the warm good bathing which was a bit shame as it would have been nice ##r if the bath tub had a little more depth . Lo ##bby is reasonable , check ##in and check ##out was smooth and good service . Overall , good stay in the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My son and I came in for the weekend to see the Bears and Black ##hawks games . While the teams didn ’ t cooperate , The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel delivered a win as usual . The room was in great shape , and the service was excellent across the board . We are looking forward to our next stay ( and next year for the teams ) ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Connie in the club lounge was amazing . Very at ##ten ##tive very friendly and made our evening special Robbie was also sweet and helpful as well . Great team ! I also have to say that Renee the previous night was engaging . What incredible customer service , this was a great place to hang with our family ! Thank you [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was a great experience and friendly staff . Clean rooms . Will recommend and be back for the future . Clean ##liness was great . Great location for walking distance and very convenient for everything Rate a excellent trip [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t for my birthday , the hotel and evening reception was very nice . Food options were good . Bath ##room smelled of mild ##ew , toilet made a loud noise when flush ##ing and pool had hair c ##lump ##s in it like it hadn ' t been cleaned . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came from Denver for a long weekend in Chicago to see the sights and some football . On a typically snow ##y , chill ##y winter weekend , the Monaco was the perfect warm welcome after long days of walking around downtown . The location was ideal for visiting Michigan Avenue and seeing the Christmas Lights parade . The wine happy hour and co ##zy fireplace were a treat , and the room itself was beautiful with amazing views of the river and downtown ! We ' ll definitely be back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This whole hotel experience was absolutely amazing . The staff members were all extremely helpful and friendly . Really persona ##ble v ##alet drivers in the best way possible . Our stay in the grand luxury suite couldn ' t have gone any better thank you all ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The quality of the customer service exceeded my expectations . The clean ##liness of the room was exceptional . The bed was extremely comfortable . The location made it an easy walk or U ##ber ride to everywhere I needed or wanted to go . Thank you for the experience ! Russ B [SEP]
0	[CLS] My boyfriend and I took our first vacation to Chicago a few years ago and spent it at ( formerly ) Am ##al ##fi Hotel . Great location ! I don ' t know if the hotel still offers the happy hour with unlimited drinks and anti ##pas ##to app ##eti ##zers , but this was a big draw for us to always look into coming back . I agree with the other guests when they saw the hidden costs do add up in the end , and their hotel fee does seem to be higher than most of the other nice ( r ) hotels in the area . But if they still offer that happy hour with unlimited drinks and apps , with the breakfast , it ' s definitely worth it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is my f ##ave property in Chicago . So much history but so right now too ! And saw that B ##re Smith was back on property and had to come back to see her and experience the hotel again now that I ’ m back traveling for work ! I know this will be the first of many visits ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was very nice . My room was class ##ed as a standard room and had one queen sized bed , which was perfect for me since I was traveling alone . The room had a sitting area in front of the windows , with a great view of the Chicago River below . The room also had a nice - sized bathroom . The only draw ##back I find to this hotel was the parking situation . There was v ##alet parking at the hotel , which I ended up using because of convenience . Other than that , you had to find the public parking area near the hotel . The roads in the area of the hotel have two levels , an upper and lower level , so they get a bit confusing , if you ' re not familiar with them . In comparison to the public parking prices , the v ##alet parking didn ' t seem too much higher , so I did that with no problems . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was past its prime 30 years ago . The room was a mess - - the water out of the shower was literally a trick ##le , the electrical outlet on the ancient lamp on the desk didn ' t work so my laptop didn ' t charge , and the TV signal was intermittent ( which they blamed on " the weather " ) . My room was never made up even though I was out by 7 am and not back until 9 pm ( and was only back in the room for maybe 90 minutes during the day ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful old property . Value was left empty as I did not see the rate I paid ( company business ) . The room did not score high because it lacked in - room amenities of a coffee / tea pot and refrigerator . Plus , my shower ##s were cut short in the am due to lack of hot water . The lobby ceiling is one of the most beautiful in the world . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a great place to stay on business . The room was spacious , well appointed and utterly comfortable . It was close to the lake , the Gold Coast , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and other attractions . The staff was incredibly nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location close just off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , supper service , lively bar , great amenities . This is a go to location for me when visiting Chicago . There is lots to enjoy in the area : great restaurants within walking distance , easy walk to A ##rgo Tea or Star ##bu ##cks , or enjoy breakfast in the hotel . You will not be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Marcus , the front desk agent , was so kind and helpful ! ! We checked in around 12 ##am after a long flight and he recognized that it was both our anniversary and partners birthday celebration so he was able to upgrade up to a suite ! It was so fun and the room was wonderful . Great hotel , friendly staff , comfortable beds and a wonderful location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , comfortable room , nice view but expensive . Room rate per night could be more competitive , but the issue lies more on the restaurant and bar that are totally over ##p ##rice ##d , which is a shame when you travel for business ( with less time / opportunities to " escape " the hotel ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here after attending a concert and couldn ' t be more pleased ! Our room was fantastic with an amazing window seat and gorgeous views . The staff was helpful and kind . This was a wonderful quick weekend get ##away and we will be staying here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is convenient ##ly located in downtown Chicago . It ' s beautifully appointed and quiet . Any quest stay is sure to be comfortable . I was in Chicago for a business conference and the conference was also held at the hotel . A great venue and hotel . Staff was very professional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came for St Patrick ' s Day weekend which also happened to be our anniversary , we had the best time ! B ##re made sure our stay was perfect ! Our suite was beautiful and had a special little anniversary gift ! She introduced us to Alex in the lobby bar who made the B ##ES ##T Al ##mond Milk La ##ttes for us every morning . And Matt the host at P ##ump Room who was super sweet and helpful . This is our Chicago place to stay for sure ! Can ' t wait to go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From receiving an email from a person ( not automated ) in ##qui ##ring for the reason for my visit in order to make it the best possible , to giving my children special attention , to giving us gift for the kids in our room , freshly made snack ##s and even a very personal H ##AN ##D WR ##IT ##TE ##N note left in our room during turn down service … . I ' ll never stay anywhere else while in Chicago ! The breakfast was amazing too - who can resist a French past ##ry ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good hotel , great local ##ization . The room is wonderful . We have good space and the bathroom is very con ##fort ##able . The only problem was during check ##out because the door staff was not so pro ##mpt ##ness to help us to find a taxi to the airport . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved the location and the service was great . We walked to all the events and restaurants . Everyone was very nice and we would for sure stay at the So ##fit ##el again . We certainly felt warmly welcomed to Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was small but very clean , the staff was friendly and helpful , and the location ( right downtown ! ) was perfect ! We were within walking distance of several restaurants and a quick cab ride to Navy Pier . I would stay here again without hesitation ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My mom and I stayed at the O ##m ##ni during our mother / daughter get ##away last weekend . I checked many of the reviews before ##hand and was pleasant ##ly surprised with the number of recent positive reviews . Mine is no different . We arrived about 1 : 00 and were immediately able to check in . We were given a king suite on the 24th floor ( of 25 ) that had a great view of Lake Michigan from a ##far . Room was spacious and clean . The staff always greeted us , whether it was the front desk or v ##alet staff . We were provided with a few great restaurant recommendations as well . Great location to be able to walk most anywhere , or to catch an U ##ber and be in most neighborhoods in a reasonable amount of time . Would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nice hotel , great location , clean , poor air quality caused coughing by me and wife . Areas smelled must ##y . I would likely not stay in this hotel again . I worry there is mold because I do not have this problem in most other hotels . Matt ##ress sa ##gged . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed one night after taking the train into Chicago in preparation for a late - night flight out of O ' Hare . We stayed on a AAA - family rate . The public areas of the hotel were very nice , the staff was incredible . The included breakfast b ##uff ##et the next morning was also really good . We had a two - bed , two - bathroom family room , unfortunately , the room was very dated , with visibly worn paint , doors , chairs etc . It was however very clean . With the exception of the room it was a fantastic hotel . Easy walking distance to the museums , great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a conference there and was away from my 8 month old for the first time . I was so app ##re ##cia ##tive of the microwave and refrigerator cart they brought to my room to sa ##ni ##ti ##ze and store bottles . Also , I pre - ordered Fed ##E ##x cooler boxes and was able to ship the milk home from the Fed ##E ##x store right inside of the hotel . If you are a nursing mom and are traveling to Chicago with the goal of maintaining your milk supply and sending home , this place rocks ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Hotel on Erie Street is located in the middle of where you want to be for E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING . The staff was excellent , the rooms were te ##rri ##fic and loaded with up to date technology . From the time you walk in the door until the time you leave , the staff does what it can to make you feel welcome . Very at ##ten ##tive to needs , persona ##ble and just a great experience for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location . Suite did not have table / chairs in kitchen . Suite seemed a bit stuff ##y . Room ##s only have fan setting . Re ##quest a fan for sleeping . Staff friendly , food is nice , building staff go above to accommodate [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a wonderful time at this hotel - views are spectacular and the service team were a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , helpful and eager to please . The bar is situated nicely in the lobby with a sunk ##en private cool feel . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel . The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful , and offered suggestions on what to do during our stay . I definitely recommend the river view rooms , they have window seats with a nice view overlooking the river . The location was very convenient and we were able to walk to all the main sights ( Millennium Park , Hancock observatory , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , etc . ) . I would definitely stay here again next time I ' m in Chicago . Also , note that the W ##i ##F ##i is free . You just have to sign up for their rewards program which just takes a minute and is free to sign ##up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In ##ti ##mate , peaceful , del ##uxe . I didn ' t want to leave room as it brought such relaxation . Staff texts and responds . I was able to reach out by text and receive immediate answer . En ##joy ##ed rest ##ock of water and coffee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are spacious and the majority have nice views and comfortable enough beds . Bath ##rooms are large with tempered glass shower ##s and a separate tub . Meeting areas could use a bit of an update . Otherwise , great lake front location and court ##eous staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Glad we chose this hotel . We had a room with a great view of Lake Michigan . Being so close to everything was great . Soo ##o much happening in the nearby parks across the street . Great restaurants in the vicinity as well . Will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay at Public Hotel . The coffee bar gave free re ##fill ##s all day ! Our rooms were clean ( and kept cleaned ) . The front desk was very helpful in getting us directions to get around the city via trains . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Jordan Con ##tre ##ras was superb . From my initial with her , she was professional and helpful with my requests . Our interaction with everyone at the Chicago O ##m ##ni was beyond our expectations . The door ##man & bell ##men were welcoming and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Friendly front desk staff was well informed . The house ##keeping department kept our rooms spot ##less and well supplied with everything necessary for an enjoyable stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is located in the heart of Chicago and the location is really good . Room is fairly good too . However , during pan ##de ##mic , the hotel doesn ' t allow you to enjoy all the amenities you might expect . So just re ##con ##side ##r your visit . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am not from the city and it was my sister ' s bachelor ##ette party . I needed a place we could go during the day where we could eat , open presents , and play some games . I booked the celebrity suite and it was perfect - - incredibly spacious . Every employee was super friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I would book here again in a heartbeat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cars ##ana at the Front Des ##k was V ##ER ##Y helpful ! Upon checking in she helped me with several different pieces of information I needed to or ##ient myself to the area . Wen ##t above and beyond the call in assisting me with directions as well as places to eat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every interaction with staff was excellent . They ' re helpful , at ##ten ##tive and seemed to care about delivering a great experience for guests . Very good location , close the Chicago River and a couple of blocks from Millennium Park . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a very nice hotel in a very convenient area of Chicago but the room has no fridge or dresser . That was very strange since those items are typically standard in a 4 star hotel . I wouldn ’ t stay here again because I ’ m sure there are plenty of other nice hotels in the area with more amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with our 3 kids on a weekend trip to Chicago and very pleased we did ! High ##lights - amazing location ! ! Located right on the river for easy walks to Navy Pier , She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , shopping on Michigan Ave , access to river es ##p ##lana ##de . Super friendly staff ! The weekend was CR ##A ##Z ##Y busy due to Co ##vid re ##ope ##ning and a club volleyball tour ##ney staying at the hotel , but all the staff was very patient and helpful . Clean ##liness - our room was im ##ma ##culate and comfortable . My only complaint was no fridge for drinks . For the very reasonable price and amazing location , we would def stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . Love ##ly rooms . Excellent customer service . Re ##ception ##ist recognised my British accent and asked if I would like a k ##ett ##le and tea ##bag ##s to be brought to my room - a consider ##ate and thoughtful gesture and one which was greatly appreciated . Fantastic location . Would definitely stay here again and have already stayed several times before . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' re three grown ladies who travel together each spring break ( we ' re two principal ##s and a teacher ) . We stayed for four days and loved the Mon ##oc ##o .

0	[CLS] I cannot r ##ave enough about our recent stay at Palmer House . My husband and I were immediately greeted by the v ##alet , who were quick , efficient and very helpful . The lobby looked stunning with its holiday decorations , and we were treated to the most delight ##ful check - in experience by Tyler , who went above and beyond to make our weekend special . He was thoughtful and helpful , and even presented us with complementary drink v ##ou ##chers and a room upgrade to celebrate our special occasion . We are so grateful for his kindness . The room was lovely and clean , and had a fully stock ##ed mini ##bar and wonderful ##ly comfortable bed . Every hotel staff member we passed in the hallway ##s was friendly and smiling - truly , this was an exceptional experience from start to finish . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay in a wonderful Gold Floor suite which was spacious and comfortable . Staff members were fantastic . The Gold Floor Lounge was fine - although way fewer menu choices offered than at other Fair ##mont hotels . Overall , a nice hotel that I ' d definitely recommend . [SEP]

Need I say more ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Hotel was central ##ly located and within walking distance of many things . Room furnishings were dated and could stand to be replaced ; especially the bed frame . Hotel restaurant had great food and a nice breakfast b ##uff ##et . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first visit to the Kim ##pton but definitely not the last . From the greeting from the door ##man , to the check in process , to the door opening into a f ##abulous room , our first impression was nothing short of excellent . The rooms were very comfortable and the window seats are pure genius ! What a place to chill out after a long day of sights ##ee ##ing . The location is very central , with great views of the river . Everyone on staff was friendly , helpful and well informed about where to go , what to see and do . We will make it a point to stay there the next time we are in Chicago and highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] i had an amazing stay at the So ##fit ##el . The location is perfect and when the weather is co ##oper ##ating you can sit outside in their patio and relax . Their breakfast is delicious with home made past ##ries or you can pick up a quick coffee to go . The staff goes out of their way to be helpful and we were travelling with a young child and they could not have been more a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent one night here and had a good experience . This is an older hotel and the lobby is seemed a little dark and dated . The elevator is also showing its age . However , the room was nicely updated with a comfortable bed , large flat screen t ##v , mini bar , coffee maker and a bathroom that felt new . I even had a s ##li ##ver of a view of the lake from the room window . The hotel has a great location and is walking distance to the stores and good restaurants . Check out Eat ##aly if you like Italian food ! The room rate was also very good . I liked the hotel because it convey ##s a sense of Chicago ' s history . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I spent 3 nights at the O ##m ##ni . The staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful . The location on the M ##M was perfect . Lots of fun walking . The room was large , a suite , and very nice and comfortable and clean . I would certainly stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The P ##ump Room has good food and great am ##bie ##nce . The Library is great for quiet drinks . At ##ten ##tive staff . Good location for walking around Gold Coast and Old Town . Room ##s are small but clean and very quiet . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is not worth the price you will pay for it . During my trip I came across hotels with similar price and location who offered much more than what I experienced at this hotel . The rooms / hallway ##s were not clean and the compliment ##ary breakfast quality was way below what I would expect from Home ##wood Suite ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room and amenities were quite nice . While is is very large , I was there during a convention and there were lines and delays everywhere . The hotel is not convenient to the subway system and a long walk to most tourist venues . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The good : rooms were in good location , lobby was nice , and the steak ##house also provided a pleasant atmosphere . I liked that the rooms at this She ##rato ##n property are up to date . The bad : More of a business v ##ibe at this property and I ' m not sure why I ' d go out of my way to stay here for leisure . The location in particular has room for improvement . . . it ' s in that awkward part of the loop with the different levels and some u ##ber drivers have a hard time finding it . I think it ' s easier to stay by the W ##it or the W , and the am ##bie ##nce of the bars at those sorts of hotels is more exciting for both business and leisure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 8 dollars for a bottle of water , . 77 dollars a day to park your car , 30 dollars for a breakfast b ##uff ##et , none of it is worth the money they charge . Have to pay extra to even use the work ##out room , as it is not included . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco is a wonderful hotel and lives up to its reputation of " trying to be a little bite different " and a " little personal . " The staff are very helpful and can smile and well as take a joke . The wine hour at 5 is fun and the crowd I ran into very friendly and conversation ##al . The restaurant is great ( with a few g ##lit ##ches like most places ) . I highly recommend and will stay at the Monaco when I next travel to Chicago ( when it is not freezing ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I go to ch ##ica ##go at least twice a year and have stayed at other hotels but the o ##m ##ni is great . the rooms are clean and big . the bed was a little stiff but love the dark blue walls . The b ##uff ##et breakfast was great and the restaurant was really nice . The front staff was friendly and so was the con ##cier ##ge . I am going back in au ##gus ##t and the only thing I wish they had was a outdoor pool [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]

Stay ##ed on 14th floor facing south with wonderful view of downtown Chicago including the W ##rig ##ley Building . 1 hour walk to She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , 5 minutes to Chicago river , 10 minutes to John Hancock tower . Good compliment ##ary breakfast and supper . Fast elevators . Pleasant staff . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary internet service wasn ' t good . . . my only complaint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel , superb staff . Could only stay there as I was with a group ; no doubt others can afford such places regularly , but they did give us a good group rate for the location ( Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ) and the quality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was gorgeous , appreciated the upgrade , but disappointed with staff o ##blivion . Restaurant service was under ##w ##hel ##ming . Food was served out of order and tasted very ordinary . No follow up . I would probably stay again , but standards need to be raised . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is very comfortable and nice . I can ’ t see myself staying anywhere else . Getting a room with a view of the lake or canal is the best . The quality of the food is very good , although it is a bit price ##y . The only thing that would make this hotel better , is if it was pet friendly [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is right on the river . We crossed over to Spin for fun & dinner then watched the parade & fireworks before grabbing the free hot chocolate in the lobby . We love the window seats . My daughter took it over as her study area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our 1 night stay here , I only wish we could of checked in early but our room wasn ' t ready yet at 1 : 30 pm . We had a 25 $ food credit but we were told it was for the restaurant , found out when we checked out that we could have used it for the little coffee shop too . . Our room was very clean and had a ton of space ! It was located really far down Michigan a ##ve , just off to the side street , which was fine for us . . Would return here for sure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited for the Christmas holiday and were very happy with our clean room and space . The staff is very friendly , in particular D ##wayne was very helpful , polite , and persona ##ble . The hotel is in walking distance to beautiful shops , restaurants , and coffee shops . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I arrived at the Public Chicago to check in and to our horror we realised we had accidentally booked for the month before ! The manager kindly managed to find us a room at the hotel ( even though it was fully booked ) , and even issued a re ##fu ##nd for our previous booking ! We were so thankful as they did not need to do this for us as it was our error , but goes to show how much this hotel values their customers . The hotel was beautifully presented in a gorgeous location . Would definitely come back to this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My father and I stayed at Farm ##oint for 2 nights . The front desk g ##ente ##lm ##en checked us in 10 min , which was great after 8 hours travelling on the plane ! The rooms were nice , very clean and comfortable . We went to lunch at Columbus Ta ##p and had a great service with Eli ##tha ##beth who told us all about the city , what local restaurants not to miss and her favorite pizza . She was very pleasant and made us laugh . We had a great time staying in Chicago and we ' ll be back ##n soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended a conference in Chicago and stated at the Fair ##mont . The room was exceptional . Hotel staff were very friendly as well . I luck ##ed out and had a great view from my room of millennium park , the pier and lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited for the cu ##bs game for my parent ' s 35th anniversary & had the best time . Only place we stay in Chicago . Great location & wonderful staff . Everything was better than expected due to the pan ##de ##mic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you want a beautiful hotel near Navy Pier , the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , n Rice ##r Walk , w / o regard for amendments , this is your place . The hotel IS beautiful . But there are many con ##s . I booked a Play n Park rate to include parking . They never found that . I had to pay $ 60 / a ni ##te extra to [UNK] [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am fond of the Fair ##mont Chicago which is very convenient for my business . The staff is especially dedicated to the well being of their guests . Our room was comfortable but not special . The hotel should have a greater selection and availability of breakfast options . Room service and the restaurant care very expensive ; the breakfast menu in the lobby bar is limited and not protein packed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I won ; t be back here . Not at these prices and with this level of service . Show ##ed up at 2 . 30 pm after a long flight . Was told that there was no room ready for me or my colleague . This felt like a s ##cam because they did offer a room upgrade for $ 25 , which would be available immediately . If they really didn ' t have a room available they could have offered the upgrade for free . Especially since the room rate was already high ( $ 435 ) Check out is at noon , so I am b ##af ##fled that by 230 ##pm there would not be a room available . It has certainly never happened to me before . In the end I was able to check in at 5 . 30 . With so many other options in the same neighborhood , I certainly will not bother with this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the public spaces are beautiful and the staff incredibly a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . It is worth sa ##c ##ri ##fic ##ing on dates bathroom ##s for a great location . We were able to walk of U ##BE ##R to everything we wanted to . The walls are thin and there is no turn down service . I would not consider this a full service hotel , but we had access to the Executive Club as a Diamond member [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location and works for business or pleasure . You can get to any place quickly including downtown and the arts area . It is accessible by transportation to and from the airport . I have used the hotel on a number of occasions and will again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I travel to Chicago for business , but had a chance to do some sights ##ee ##ing in the afternoon . This hotel had a great view of the architecture and was within minutes of the top attractions . I would definitely chose this hotel in my next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Hotel is in the perfect location for shopping . The staff was all very friendly and helpful . The rooms were very spacious . The hotel is a bit price ##y , but most of the good hotels on Michigan Ave are . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a night and loved this hotel . Love ##d the window seating and we had a great view of the city . Lots of places within walking distance . Easy to get to . Staff was very friendly . Only wish they had a better late night room service menu , but that ' s my only complaint . We will be staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice non me ##ga chain Chicago hotel . Close to Michigan Avenue and MA ##N ##Y good restaurants . Not too far from train station and Millennium Park . Clean , bright , well appointed rooms . Big bathroom . To ##ken ##s for free beer / drinks in their lounge ( dessert served as well ) . A very nice stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We left a cell phone in a taxi . K ##wa ##me from the front desk spent a great deal of time getting it back for us . We also enjoyed the superb location just off Michigan Avenue , the Martin ##i Bar , and the restaurants and sites nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a grand hotel in a great location , we were able to walk everywhere . What a beautiful rot ##unda , patrons seemed to gather there throughout the day . We enjoyed ma ##rt ##ini ##s in the lobby bar each night . Our room was comfortable and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was waiting for the hotel to re - open . When it did , I booked without realizing the restaurant and bar weren ’ t open . However , Ken ##zi and B ##re had suggestions and guided me through the neighborhood . The rooms was very comfortable and clean , thank you housekeeper ##s - I travel a lot and I appreciate what everyone is doing . I ’ m planning on coming back next month and you know I ’ ll be back . I should mention , v ##alet isn ’ t back but they said soon - just makes it easy to come and go . Thank you team Ambassador you made me feel at home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Po ##ssi ##bly the most quiet hotel room I have stayed in . The room dark ##ening d ##rap ##es were very affect ##ive and the room temperature was just right . Very comfortable and co ##zy rooms . Staff was very helpful and pleasant . The hotel is located more to one end of Michigan Ave . so you do have a lot of walking but that ' s not necessarily a bad thing if you like trying all the good food the area has to offer ( the exercise is a good thing ) . Great visit and pleasant stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at Sharon Grand Chicago in March 2016 ( business travel ) . I booked club room and i was impressed with how wonderful and helpful staff was in the club room , very kind , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and fun ! Hotel is very much comfortable , it is a large establishment in great location near good restaurants and walking distance to everything . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The most amazing thing about these old historic buildings are the el ##egan ##ce and s ##ple ##ndo ##r of the detail . The room size are typical Chicago size . Not big . But their sheets may have been the best , to date ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and her husband chose the Kim ##pton All ##egro for their wedding and reception on New Year ' s Eve ; they could not have made a better choice ! The facility , planning , food , and staff were truly amazing ! Though they handle dozens of weddings a year , we felt like we were the only people in the hotel . Everyone from the bell ##man that greeted us , to the servers at dinner were friendly and went out of their way to make the night special ! Al ##yssa coordinated the wedding for J ##ac ##que and Hunter and we absolutely loved her . She made it so easy , handled all the details , and worked extremely well with the outside vendors . Our guests loved the food and the am ##bian ##ce - if you haven ' t been yet , treat yourself to one of the City ' s g ##ems ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotels . Co ##m strikes again . Found this cool hotel just by chance . Bo ##uti ##que like with very comfortable rooms . Coffee and in ##fused water in the lobby where we sat by the fireplace to read the newspaper . Service was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our birthday get - away to this Hotel . The room was clean and the staff was helpful and very friendly . The staff sent up a birthday greeting card along with sparkling water and chocolate ##s . The location is perfect for getting around to great places to see and things to do like the river ##walk , The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for shopping and close to the Parks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were only at the Talbot ##t for an overnight stay . We drove into town to see The Rolling Stones at Soldier Field . Everything at the hotel was excellent . Our room was spacious and the bed was amazing . We will definitely come back [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location to all the sites . Em ##p ##loy ##ees worked hard to make sure all our needs were met . Great breakfast that ’ s free . Love ##d the 24 h ##r coffee with y ##um ##my cream ##ers . Room ##s very clean and loved the full kitchen for left ##overs . We enjoyed the nice size pool on the 19th floor big open windows to see the sky ##scraper ##s with lights at night . Kids loved that . In two weeks I with my sister are staying at Home ##2 Suite ##s a Hilton in Philadelphia . We always stay at Hilton ’ s because we are always happy with everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great value hotel by Chicago standards . The hotel is clean , comfortable and reasonably well maintained . Staff is solid . Especially the bartender ##s , those guys do a fantastic job . Great drinks and generous pour ##s of b ##our ##bon for our group all weekend . I have stayed several times and will stay again in the future . This hotel is Also in a great location . Close to everything shopping and restaurant related so if you like shopping and food this is for you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el experience was perfect from the welcome to the beautiful room and large bathroom to the con ##cier ##ge ’ s recommendations for restaurants in the area . Walking distance to shopping , Art In ##st ##iti ##te and millennium park and b ##uck ##in ##ham fountain . Don ’ t miss the C ##ica ##go River Sr ##chi ##tec ##ture tour . Not an inexpensive stay but well worth it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were spacious and clean . The compliment ##ary breakfast was good and the selection changed everyday ( no repetition ) . Hotel was in the downtown core and everything was within walking distance of the hotel . Staff were court ##eous and professional . Would definitely stay and recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay at the Talbot ##t . The staff was so friendly , especially D ##wayne who assisted us from the moment we arrived . We grabbed our bags with a big smile on his face , asked us what our plans were , made some suggestions , gave us some free drink cards and remembered us the next day when we came down . He is a genuinely great guy and we felt very well taken care of ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family loved the pool and room was comfortable but dark and the view ( a brick wall ) disappointing . Overall , convenient for my conference and seeing the sites . Service could be more reliable ( a few requests were ignored or mi ##sin ##ter ##p ##ret ##ed ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for our 1 ##ye ##ar wedding anniversary . The room was very nicely decorated and the king bed was comfortable . Staff was friendly upon check - in although less helpful over the course of the stay when we needed a few things . Custom ##er service was good overall . The hotel offered a champagne hour at 5 and compliment ##ary coffee and tea in the morning which was very nice . I wish we had stayed another night . We had already booked another night at a chain hotel along the river otherwise we would have . Would definitely return again and stay at any Kim ##pton hotel in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Location and wonderful hotel . Staff was very helpful and friendly . Even with the Festival of Lights the day we arrived , they were staffed and ready for the extra customers . Park ##ing was included which made it that much easier . More than willing to get your car if you needed it for anything . Will stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was amazing ! ! Room was perfect . . room service was one hundred percent wonderful the food was OK . . . . . We stayed for 5 nights and I would have stayed for 500 it was so comfortable ! ! I ' m looking forward to going again soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location , room , and staff were outstanding . From check in to check out the staff was at ##ten ##tive , re ##sp ##ons ##ive and g ##rac ##ious . The location was central to museums , shopping , dining , and parks . We look forward to our return visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing location right in front the river ##walk ! ! Walking distance to everything ! ! Del ##icious breakfast ! Super modern lobby ! Room ##s are a bit older but they are nice size and clean . The check in took forever but the express ch ##ek ##out was good ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would like to thank all the staff in Gold ##c ##lass , especially Mu ##gi , Man ##dan ##a and Jesus for taking care of me on my entire trips from May 29 to June 4th . It was happened that I fell ill at the day I arrived . This best team had tried their best to take care of me until I got better and able to attend my conference . They make me feel at home during my stay and I highly recommend anyone who visits Chicago to stay here if you want to experience great service and hospitality . Special thanks for Mu ##gi , Man ##dan ##a , and Jesus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The coffee shop provided a good selection of breakfast and lunch options , although the salad ##s se ##re long on let ##tu ##ce . Mixed green ##s would have helped . I had the breakfast bar on a Monday morning . The eggs and potatoes were only warm but tasted good . Restaurant staff could not wait to grab knives and fork ##s so quickly that upon returning with a little more breakfast a colleague had to ask twice for a replacement fork . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location to everything Chicago . It has some nice touches . Each floor has its own continental breakfast . One is given token ##s for drinks at the Happy Hour with nice snack ##s . We had more than one drink each night and still had coins . The rooms are nice . The staff is very nice and helpful . I had not heard of this hotel until I booked it , but I will not hesitate to book it again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a perfect place to spend four nights . Jo ##ven ##e ( reservations and guest services ) is such an asset to the hotel . Michael at the reservation desk is also a great gentleman and such help . We encountered no issues during this entire stay . The food for breakfast was exceptional . Pool area is enclosed and heated . Great for families as well as the business travel ##er . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I reserved a superior double room . It was smaller than the pictures on the website looked . The hotel lobby was old and needed painting and updated . The carpet in the rooms was older , and no views at all from the one window ( the picture of the room I thought I ' d get had 2 windows ) The bath ##tub did not drain and had to call to get it fixed . The hair ##dr ##yer didn ' t heat up , had to call for a new one . The bathroom was also very small , not like the pictures depicted . I would not stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had the di ##sp ##lea ##sure of visiting this hotel on 6 / 26 . The rooms are old ( r ##adia ##tor in the bathroom had r ##ust around the edges , and there was excessive dust on the vent ##s where air blows into the room ) , loud ( excessive ambient noise from outside ) , in need of additional help at the front desk ( heard people commenting around me about the wait time ) , and better policing of the hotel itself , as I saw paper wrap ##pers , and other items on the floor as I walked around . I am a Diamond member with Hilton and this is one of the worst Hilton properties I have visited . My suggestion is to avoid this hotel at all costs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am an I ##H ##G rewards member and this hotel is one of my favorites . I normally stay for business but this was for a Cardinal Cubs game with another couple . I had never stayed in the old tower and was not disappointed . The rooms were small but had everything you needed and the bathroom was large and well appointed ! The beds were inviting with lots of pillows and the view was great . Every single person with the hotel I encounter was warm and respect ##ful and willing to help . We enjoyed a glass of wine and a wonderful ch ##ar ##cute ##rie plate after the game at E ##N ##O ' s , what a fun co ##zy place ! Another plus is the Star ##bu ##cks right off the main lobby ! A special thanks to Emily in group reservations for helping me organize my reservations even though we were a group of 4 ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Chicago O ##m ##ni is a central ##ly located and beautiful hotel with excellent front desk and bell ##man service and an excellent restaurant . The rooms are well appointed and comfortable . There is considerable noise from ambulance ##s and police sire ##ns in the middle of the night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Hotel Experience , this is a Wonderful Property with a Staff that has a great how can I help you approach . Great location which allows for a great visit to Chicago . I highly recommend this hotel for a home base to enjoy your Chicago experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves the rooms / king suite was very spacious and clean . The location on Michigan Ave was excellent for shopping and sight seeing even in the f ##rig ##id cold . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I traveled to Chicago for a conference with a small group and we stayed at the Hilton . It was a wonderful experience . Everybody was so friendly and helpful . We used v ##alet parking and were able to check in early . The bell ##man took care of our luggage while we went to sights ##ee . The front desk clerk who checked us in was extremely nice and cheerful . We couldn ' t have asked for a better experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is awesome and lake side rooms have a beautiful view . The room was very cold on arrival and didn ' t heat up until engineering fixed the heating system late in the night . It ' s a beautiful old hotel , old being the key word . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just returned from a weekend in Chicago and a stay at the Conrad . The staff and accommodation ##s were top notch , similar to other Conrad hotels I ’ ve stayed at . Dr ##ink ##s at the bar were delicious and food at both the lobby level and rooftop restaurants was great . I look forward to a return trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a historic hotel in a downtown location very convenient for business . Although a fine hotel , with exquisite common areas , the individual room was worn and tired . Breakfast was over priced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was here on business at the end of June . Beautiful hotel situated just a couple blocks from the river close to a lot of shops and restaurants . The hotel has a champagne happy hour at 5 PM each day which was a nice plus as we had a group in from NY on business and it staged a solid meeting point . Upon leaving , I was recommended by staff to take the train to the airport . Train station was two blocks from the hotel and easily accessible . Given the car traffic in the city , the train was a welcome decision and an easy ride . Overall , great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights on business in September 2019 . Initial impressions were ta ##inted by the check in process taking far too long , but after that , the remainder of the stay was pleasant and comfortable . Room ##s are good sized with all the usual amenities . Hotel restaurant was very expensive for breakfast , but you can save a few dollars by visiting the Star ##bu ##cks which is accessible directly from the lobby . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the Hilton many times . It is an older hotel with great history in Chicago . It seems as if the management is working hard to keep this hotel top notch . Prior miss ##tep ##s did not occur this trip . We obtained 3 rooms all online check in and all close together on the 16th floor . Such luck ! Room ##s are clean updated and comfortable . We had lovely views of the lake . Lo ##bby bar needs to open earlier on Friday nights . Under ##sta ##ffed - our only disappointment . Check in and out lines were shorter than usual . Beautiful ##ly decorated for the holidays . Excellent b ##uff ##et breakfast but very price ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Prior to my arrival , I received an email from Travis Howard , the Guest Relations Manager at the hotel . Not only did he welcome me but also offered to en ##roll me in the hotels loyalty program , asked about additional reservations ( I had 3 rooms reserved ) and offered assistance with any reservations I may need during my stay . Upon enrollment in the hotels loyalty program he was able to upgrade my rooms and was able to put my family all on the same floor . He contacted me not only during , but also after my stay . We had to extend a night because if the heavy snow ##fall , this was a process he also made sea ##m ##less . All around , Travis is a true hospitality professional and is the reason I will return to the Ambassador and recommend to anyone coming to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic conference experience . I was very impressed with everything . Great facilities , food , and service . They had a lot of people taking care of everything associated with the conference - meals , clean ##liness , and snack ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent . Great location and City views . World class service . Short walk to restaurants and key sites . As with every hotel the pillows are a disaster . Please invest in top end memory foam pillows that support the neck . All your pillows are soft and lose their shape . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is incredible ! ! ! The staff really care . It feels like walking into a new age great g ##ats ##by hotel . Great detail and beauty ! Room ##s are a ta ##d small but the overall experience greatly overs ##had ##ows that ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for two nights . Great location and the employees , every one of them , made us feel right at home . Didn ' t matter who we asked , or walked by , they smiled , greeted and wished us a great day . Room was quiet , comfortable and all we could ask for . 67 ##6 Lounge was com ##fy and the cheese tray was excellent . Breakfast b ##uff ##et surprised us for quality and even the price wasn ' t un ##rea ##son ##able . Should we ever make another trip to Chicago , we will stay here again , no doubt . Excellent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I forgot to review my stay and for prompted by SP ##G site to do so . I have decided to to review here as well . She ##rato ##n Grand is a very nice hotel . I would recommend it to anyone . Super ##b location , clean , nice rooms , views . If you are a gold or platinum member as I am you get an access to the lounge with free breakfast and happy hour . Again super location , would recommend for business or family trip to Chicago . T ##H [SEP]
0	[CLS] We ' ve been staying here for years . I think that t ' s the best that Chicago has to offer in terms of comfort and value . The food is good , the staff goes the extra mile to serve . They ' re very friendly . We ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this location for four days and we really love how central ##ly the hotel is situated . We were able to park the car and walk to just about all the attractions we wanted to visit . The rooms do need some T ##LC as they are old and in need of renovations . The staff are generally court ##eous and helpful , however , the front desk staff probably require some additional training when it comes to customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and property with extremely at ##ten ##tive staff and has ##sle - free ex ##ped ##ited check in and check out . Full service hotel including room service which was delicious . Quiet rooms with great views of the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First time at the Chicago Hilton . What a place . It is huge and has every am ##eni ##ty you need for a great stay . The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble at a reasonable price for a first class property . Stay ##ed two nights , wish I could stay longer . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My room was wonderful spacious with beautiful view of the city . Quite and very clean with a comfortable bed . The coffee offered in the room could be much better . The toilet ##ries they offer are really not good at all so don ' t forget your tooth ##pas ##te . The hair dry ##er was very old too . It was a very nice experience overall the staff is super polite and the food in the restaurant was okay . The hotel is located in a perfect location . Overall Chicago is a beautiful place to visit . I had a blast the hotel just needs to give a bit of love to the details . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am a currently a student studying Hospital ##ity at Purdue University and was more than impressed by the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . They reached out to me and so g ##rac ##iously offered to host myself and other Hospital ##ity Sales and Marketing Association students for a sales b ##litz in the city . I was E ##XT ##RE ##ME ##L ##Y impressed by their location in Chicago , their beautiful ##lly decorated hotel rooms , and their staff that was more than welcoming to us . I only have good things to say about my stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel and everything I have learned from their team . I see myself staying there for many years to come [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bed and pillows in this hotel are so nice you just don ##t want to get out of bed . Great location and it was very clean overall . The only downfall is the cost of overnight parking $ 72 kinda rough for 1 night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Easy , court ##eous check in . Love the view from my room - some Lake , some river and city lights . Good size rooms . The con ##cier ##ge lounge for evening was a bust . A ##ppe ##ti ##zers were cold and service for a drink was slow and un ##res ##po ##ns ##ive . A ##wes ##ome views though . Good place to meet up especially the second floor of the lounge . I made a mistake of picking up something from the mini bar which made an auto charge . Called the front desk and they immediately re ##ct ##ified - who ##ops [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed from 6 / 13 to 6 / 16 / 19 . I lowered the the ##rm ##ost ##at to cool down the room . When I returned a couple of hours later , the room was hot & humid . The Front Des ##k sent an engineer to check it out , and he agreed that the room was warm . He sent us a fan to use . The fan was so loud that we couldn ’ t even hear the TV . The first night was awful . I asked for a different room the following day . It was better but still not as cool as we normally get . I would not return here . It was not as pleasant as our first stay in July 2017 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located this is an old building but well updated . The pool is outstanding ! However if you have young children is doesn ’ t have a legitimate shallow end . La ##p swimmers are well taken care of as it seems to be an old Y ##MCA style pool with a 10 foot deep - end . The tiles can get slick so be careful . Just up from the Navy Pier and close to Millennium and Maggie Daily Park you can also run to the lake and go for Miles along Lake Michigan . Hard to beat for location and the room was comfortable and clean . Bed ##s excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a national conference . Nice rooms with great location to Michigan Ave etc . located along the River with easy access . Clean rooms . Staff was very at ##ten ##tive . Walking distance to most anything you would want to do . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very comfortable home away from home , but a little price ##y with the food and in room re ##f ##resh ##ments . Normally would book at a different hotel , but overall experience was good . The staff was very welcoming and room was clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect ##ly located , clean , great staff . Nothing missing . S ##le ##pt better than at home . Bo ##uti ##que feel and not an imp ##erson ##al huge hotel . Internet easy to get and fast . Lounge area co ##zy . Easy walk to Michigan Ave and lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie is a great hotel . The rooms are clean and very comfortable . The rates can ' t be beat and the staff is very at ##ten ##tive . Continental breakfast is included . A te ##rri ##fic value . I upgraded to a corner king suite . Very spacious . Will definitely be re ##tun ##ing ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for a full week at this hotel and it was just incredible ! Mary Jo & Paulo thanks so much for your 5 [UNK] service . The lobby and bar are super s ##wan ##ky , with a great v ##ibe . The photos online don ’ t do it justice ; the building is almost 100 years old ( which comes with some q ##ui ##rks ) and is so beautifully maintained and decorated inside and out ! The rooms are modern and very spacious . The a / c unit in our room wasn ’ t functioning properly and the customer service team went above and beyond to immediately fix the issue and make sure we were happy and comfortable . We used to live 2 blocks from this hotel and are completely obsessed with the neighborhood ! I will absolutely stay here again and again as long as I visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the Monaco Hotel for a business meeting . I loved the de ##cor of the hotel , very unique . Check in was easy . My room was spacious , the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was nice as well . I can ' t say enough about the staff , how helpful they all were . The meeting room was adequate for our needs and the staff was at ##ten ##tive . We had lunch served with our meeting and the food was delicious . The location is fairly close to Michigan avenue and other downtown venues . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose Monaco because we have stayed in the one in Pittsburgh and it was just a great experience . We had a great experience this time around as well , and the hotel could not be in a better location . The room was great and very clean . Although there should be some awesome views , we stayed facing the brick wall . Although the front desk was very nice and at ##ten ##tive to us , letting us check in a couple hours early ( we were just hoping to drop our bags ) , they never told us about the bicycles being available to take out . They do have complementary bikes and if you are staying here it is a great idea to take advantage of them , you can bike to all the major attractions in just minutes . Overall , great experience again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for one night to see Hamilton . Location was great . We liked the suite configuration as we are a family with teenage son . In the early evening , We became aware the room next door was occupied by several loud young women . I knew it was highly likely we would have a problem when they returned after a night out . We asked to be moved and the front desk accommodate ##d us , up ##grading us to a larger suite next door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great architecture and location , great restaurant and bar , great fitness center in 45th floor , perfect sleep quality , good service ( thanks to Ke ##enan and Sc ##or ##ces ##e in the front desk for their ate ##nti ##ve and efficient support upon arrival ) . I am a co - owner of a small company doing a big ( for us ) meeting at the hotel , we booked 100 + rooms and I am very glad we chose Swiss ##ote ##l - makes our company look great . Reason ##able value , too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was really pleased ! We had a high floor with a river view and we were treated very well , most of the restaurant options were still closed which was a b ##um ##mer but the Big Bar is great and we enjoyed it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a birthday trip and we are really glad to have chosen this hotel as our stay . Check in was fast and w ##ow were we impressed with our room view ! Now as in any big city the pop and water in the room was at a cost . Park ##ing was easy and we were close to everything . Li ##teral ##ly within walking distance . We visited the Navy Pier and could walk . Clean rooms and overall a nice stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a corner room which had a beautiful city view and was spacious . We enjoyed the restaurant several times during our stay . Each meal was very good with excellent service . They have acquired a new chef over the past year and the improvement in food and menu is wonderful . Staff are very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Whenever I go to Chicago its typically for a meeting in my companies co ##rp . offices . That said I go quite often , a preferred hotel partner is the Swiss ##ote ##l on W ##ack ##er Ave . So far I haven ' t had a bad experience , clean modern rooms . Great location within walking distance of Michigan Ave and surrounded by excellent restaurants . Palm Restaurant and lobby bar is great as well in the Hotel . Court ##eous front desk staff and quick elevators . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nearby to everything , re ##son ##able rates and excellent staff . Especially liked the well - placed mirrors in the bedroom and the free wine service at 5 ##p daily . Also sending a shout out to Rich the Con ##cier ##ge , he was always very helpful to two demanding New Yorker ##s ! . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a great spot to stay . You are pretty central in the city and about a quarter block walk to the L train . Good food and shopping also surrounding the hotel . The rooms are not huge , but definitely large enough to be comfortable . They also have a full fridge so it is perfect for the week long trips when you may not want to eat out every night and try some local ingredients . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The perfect hotel when staying in Chicago ! The hotel is located perfectly while staying in Chicago . The hotel is amazing , elegant and full of Chicago history . The room was very clean and looked like it was recently updated . The staff was very professional and friendly . We had breakfast in the hotel every morning and my boys , all under 11 , had a large b ##uff ##et to choose from . I will be staying again this summer . I wouldn ' t stay anywhere else . Can you tell I love this hotel lo ##l [SEP]
1	[CLS] Close to everything , breakfast that was included was great , not just a coffee and a past ##ry . Bed was almost as good as home . I recommend the hotel and will definitely stay there again . They want 200 characters for ##a review so now I will ram ##ble on a bit ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 4 nights for a conference at the Me ##rch ##and ##ise Mart . The Monaco is at a great location , walk ##able to the Mart as well as Millennium Park and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Staff was all friendly and helpful . Custom ##ary coffee in the morning , including ice ##d coffee . Wine hour was nice as well . The room was clean , well decorated , and pretty quiet for being on the second floor . Would definitely recommend and stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great hotel ! The de ##cor and architecture is an exceptional mix of modern and vintage . The location was perfect for catching a show , as it is in Chicago ' s theater district . Our room was comfortable , although the bathroom was very small . They brought a Ke ##uri ##g to the room upon request . I cannot say enough about the port ##ers / greet ##ers / con ##cier ##ge - they were class ##y and helpful and kind . [SEP]
1	[CLS] And . . . a great Michigan Ave , walk to everything location . Water Tower Place , The 95 ##th in the Hancock for br ##unch , World Class Shopping , beautiful Lake Michigan , and all the best restaurants of every variety all within a 6 - 8 block radius . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located , good Service , excellent restaurant ( Michael Jordan ) & bar . Mu ##y second time , hopefully there will be a third . Some rooms ( 265 ##4 ) small space to walk a ##rro ##und the be . Excellent r ##omo service , clean and fast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I normally don ' t visit the bout ##ique hotels . This one happened to be close to my meetings so I rolled the dice and came up a winner . The staff is amazing . The food at 20 East in the hotel is amazing . The bar is a good place to go and strike up a conversation . Don ' t miss out by passing up this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for years . But this trip the service ( maid service ) was terrible . The front desk was not very friendly either . Sad as in the past it was always very good . Stay the same time every year so I can not blame the Holiday ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The good : This hotel is in a very nice area and the public spaces were pleasant and taste ##fully decorated . The staff was were very polite and helpful . The bad : The rooms . I can appreciate a minimal ##ist theme but to be successful requires fine finishes , attention to the details and clean ##liness . The room failed to meet these basic requirements . I understand that this an older building which may account for the size of the room , which was small , especially the bathroom . But mi ##sma ##tched towels , dirty tile and in ##different house ##keeping is really disappointing in a room at this price . The A / C unit rat ##tles constantly which required us to turn it off to sleep . ( We were told that " that is just how the are " . ) Maybe other rooms are in better shape . I hope so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay . Close to everything . Walk ##ed to Navy Pier , millennium park , and all the shops I wanted to go to . Also wa close to where I had business . The staff was cord ##ial , and even let us check in early , which was a real plus , as we arrived in Chicago several hours before normal check in time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We liked a good sized room , great location & the very friendly & helpful staff . The platinum lounge was fantastic - a great breakfast , lovely evening snack ##s & brilliant staff . It was so pleasant to take a break there . The down ##side ##s - the room & bathroom was 10 years out of date . A renovation is really necessary to keep up with the competition . We were really looking forward to enjoying the pool - and only learnt on arrival that it was closed for renovations . Ok we got a room credit we appreciated but this should be communicated well before arrival I would think . On site dining is limited to one restaurant , that could be better . Any ##how loved the staff , the property needs a bit of love for the future . Thanks for a nice stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ren ##ted 2 rooms - went with a friend and our kids to spend a night in the city and use the pool . Both at night and the next morning our kids were s ##co ##oping bugs / cock ##roach ##es out of the pool . When I brought one of the c ##rit ##ters to the front desk the woman was disgusted and did nothing about it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I recently checked in at the Hilton Chicago , because this was my wife ’ s company event we asked if they could accommodate the spouse ( me ) . The Hilton agent Florida ( yes like the state ) was so understanding and was able to provide a larger room to accommodate the two of us . Florida the agent not the state was so helpful and friendly , she really made our two night stay truly memorable . . . . thank you FL ##OR ##ID ##A ! A . Gomez , [SEP]
1	[CLS] Big Bar area awesome with a generous happy hour and super service . American bar and g ##rill , I ate in the restaurant section and the food was exceptional as well as the service . Event area was a little challenging to get a handle on at first but all areas accessible and staff would make sure you got where you needed to be . The exercise area was phenomena ##l ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hilton beds are wonderful ! Palmer House Hotel is a grand old hotel . Re ##mind ##ed me of the movie " The Shin ##ing " when I was walking the hallway ##s to the room . Palmer House personnel were outstanding ! Location was outstanding ! Our trip to Chicago was fantastic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The walls are very thin and unfortunately our neighbors were super loud ; enough to the point where we had to call security on them . The room keys consistently de ##activated and we had to ask for new ones at least 3 times . The quality of the bed , pillows , and sheets were poor and we had to contact house ##keeping twice to come clean the room after not showing up for 2 days . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was chosen by my daughter and her husband for their wedding this past weekend , I found staff a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the hotel so architectural ##ly interesting . The door ##man , check in , bell captain , room , food , in my review are 5 ST ##AR ! This historic hotel with Egyptian hi ##ero ##gly ##phic ##s , carved stones , and Olympic size indoor pool still functioning is in the original design from 1929 . It ’ s worth the stay and certainly if not able to stay visit the Michael Jordan restaurant for dinner , you won ’ t be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , efficient , nicely re ##mo ##del ##ed older hotel . Al ##ot of charm & character with superb staff who were always ] helpful , knowledge ##able & respect ##ful . Easy access to everything and wonderful am ##bie ##nce overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were very pleased with the service we received when booking our rooms . We had a complicated booking for 4 rooms and Su ##zy was exceptionally helpful in making these arrangements for us so we All could be in close proximity . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff at this hotel are hands down some of the best I have ever experienced . They treated us like family and always found a way to go the extra mile . . . . I would highly recommend this hotel and I will definitely stay here again when I travel to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful Hotel - Front Des ##k personnel were fantastic and professional ! I needed an upgraded room because my mom and niece came for a surprise visit ! ! ! Morning coffee and evening cocktail ##s were spot on ! We absolutely loved the de ##cor ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago is located in a beautiful neighbourhood and very close to downtown . The staff are very friendly and welcoming . We were assisted in finding parking nearby . The room is very clean , beds are comfortable and yes , the bathroom is smaller as you would expect from an older building . The mood lighting was very pleasant . The lobby , lounge and restaurant are happening and the screening room was cool . The best part was the nice touch from Al ##am ##ya for making us feel welcome ! Thanks for a wonderful experience and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting us while in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in the Hotel during a business trip with a group of 9 . Great suites , spacious , clean , big kitchen , very well e ##qui ##ped and very s ##ty ##lish . Great hot compliment ##ary breakfast and great compliment ##ary food at the evenings . The lobby is big and co ##sy , comfortable and s ##ty ##lish . Great friendly staff . The location is more then perfect , steps away from magnificent mile . P ##lent ##y and very good bars and restaurants around . The Hotel is very accessible for people with di ##ssa ##bilities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are new and clean . The bathroom was spacious and it ' s in a good location for walking all over downtown . There is a continental breakfast on each floor and it was fine . Mostly past ##ries , coffee , juice and cereal , but enough to get you going . The website doesn ' t list all of the amenities , but our room had a fridge , there was a hair ##dr ##yer in the bathroom and plenty of plug ##s for charging . We paid extra for a city view but since the hotel only has 6 floors that wasn ' t such an amazing view . Not sure what the non - city view would look out on . The streets weren ' t noisy . The bell ##men were helpful in directing us to different locations . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Having stayed in a few O ##m ##ni hotels in different major USA cities we were looking forward to our Chicago stay . While the hotel offers most of the expected facilities and service , the de ##cor , lighting and service left us with the impression of this being a tired hotel . This hotel is no comparison to the O ##m ##ni in Nashville where the staff are more friendly & ' on the ball ' plus the use of space , lighting and de ##cor at O ##m ##ni Nashville makes for a much better ' v ##ibe ' The location is good if you want to walk the ' magic mile ' and engage in retail therapy . The lake is only about a 10 minute s ##tro ##ll away where there are some nice walks too . All in all sadly this was not the typical O ##m ##ni experience we have enjoyed elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Large ##r shower head would be great other than that the Hotel and staff were incredible and had much to offer . Great location . Great restaurant with great choice of food and amazing drinks . Front door staff made me feel like a celebrity . Very welcoming ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was spacious , staff was friendly , it was quiet and comfortable place to stay . A nice get ##away in the city . There was a wine tasting hour in the lobby which was nice and not over ##crow ##ded . A great location to stay if going to the theatre , we went to Cadillac Palace theatre right next door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is located in the heart of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and easily access ##es top shopping and restaurants , Navy Pier and public transport . Travel ##ling with a to ##ddler we always need a suite and this hotel was fantastic value for money in a prime location . The evening social and daily breakfast simply sealed the deal ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have hosted 3 events at this location - and the staff has always been great ! They have always worked with me on everything that I needed . Special thanks to Veronica Navarro - as she is very professional and helpful ! Love the layout of the ballroom and break ##out spaces . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Rafael e ##pit ##omi ##ses customer service at its best ! A brilliant ##ly central location in Chicago . My She ##rato ##n room was spacious , comfortable and clean . The hotel also hosted a fantastic AC ##A Summit . Rafael on the front desk was extremely understanding and huge ##ly helpful , a huge asset for She ##rato ##n . The best customer service I ' ve had . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place for business , all the amenities . In room dining was excellent . W ##if ##i was excellent . Was convenient to area sites . Quiet . Have used regularly and professional ##ism of staff is consistent . Great place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I don ’ t write many reviews but feel o ##b ##liga ##ted to share a wonderful experience . I honestly cannot think of a complaint . Perfect central location , very clean , quiet . Walking distance to theaters , the bean , navy pier and magnificent mile . The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful . Though I did not part ##ake the compliment ##ary wine happy hour was a nice option . I had my children with me and they loved the window sitting areas . They pulled the curtains and had their own private “ nests ” with W ##i ##F ##i and an amazing view of the river and t ##rump tower . They even slept in the windows several nights ( sounds odd but they ’ re about 6 ’ x ##3 ’ with a nice mattress pad and pillows ) . Not sure when or if I ’ ll be back to Chicago but if I do I will definitely stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##ac ##ilities of rooms are moderate . The most un ##sat ##is ##fa ##ctor ##y experience was payment of my luggage after check ##out . After finishing check ##out , I asked the reception for my luggage till airport . They asked me to go to far end of hotel for this service . I found the luggage service area , then The man in this area want service fee . It is the first time demanding fee for This service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco meets the average rating in my book . It isn ' t perfect but they could move up to very good easy enough . Having simple amenities in the room such as a coffee pot without having to ask . The downtown location is nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband surprised me with a weekend trip to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary . He chose this hotel because of the location and we were very pleased . The room was not large , but the modern d ##é ##cor and comfortable beds made it a great place to relax after enjoying the city . The street noises reaching us was a bit of a surprise , but it didn ' t ruin our time there . A light sleep ##er may want to choose accordingly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] . . . but you can ’ t take the smell away from the old building . And that smell doesn ’ t come into play until you step into the elevator . Moving forward , this is a nice place for a drink , but not to overnight . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hi , I stayed at the s ##wi ##ss and self parked . Alan at the door was amazing . He helped me get to the self parking garage and explained all that I needed . I have stayed at the s ##wi ##ss multiple times . But the service was tremendous . Thanks Alan . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first visit to the Grand She ##rato ##n . Overall , it was a good experience with a couple of exceptions . As a Mar ##riot ##t Titan ##ium member , I felt very much appreciated . I received a very nice room upgrade , which was awesome . The Con ##cier ##ge lounge was one of the best I ' ve been too . Connie in the lounge was a real stand ##out ! She provided truly exceptional service . There were a few small maintenance issues in the room that should have been addressed . My other challenge is that I ordered room service one night and it was insane ##ly expensive . I always expect a fairly high cost for room service , but this was pretty exceptional . I would definitely stay at this hotel again ( but find another way to get a late night dinner ! ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed my stay at Conrad . The staff were young , helpful and professional . They went the extra mile . The room was modern and clean . The location was in beat ##able . I travel for work often and stay in 4 - 5 star hotels around the world and this Conrad can hang with the best . This will be my go - to - hotel in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay and experience , as usual , with this property . However , we were disappointed to have been told we received our compliment ##ary upgrade awarded as part of our American Express Platinum Card benefits to only arrive at our room and find we were in the exact level of room we requested ( corner suite ) . We were rushed for time and did not have time to address the issue before settling and leaving the room . We certainly understand that the upgrade is only based on availability ( which we did confirm availability through the hotel booking site ) , it was unfortunate to have been mi ##sle ##d at check - in . Certainly a minor problem in the grand scheme of things , but unexpected at a Conrad property given the rates and reputation of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel location is great B ##UT the room did not meet expectations . I had two Queen size beds . One bed had a sheet that was stained with blood throughout the sheet . The shower head and tub were rusty . Not what I expected for the location and price [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our first weekend stay at the Talbot ##t Hotel in Chicago exceeded all of our expectations ! The hotel de ##cor and atmosphere was warm and inviting . The location was perfect , with many restaurants , bars , and shopping options within walking distance . The staff was professional , friendly and at ##ten ##tive . We particularly enjoyed D ##wayne , and his attention to detail and kind demeanor . He ’ s definitely a positive asset to the Talbot ##t staff . We look forward to staying at the Talbot ##t when we return to Chicago . Since ##rel ##y , Tri ##sh and Mike Phillips [SEP]
1	[CLS] Up ##sca ##le downtown hotel with good river ##front location . Mid ##rang ##e rooms are still small but nice . Bar ##s and restaurants on property but venture out to the world famous or local favorites , all within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I normally don ' t write reviews but was compelled to after our stay . We came for the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile Lights Festival and couldn ' t be more pleased with our stay . Room was clean , we stayed on the floor we asked for , and the kids loved it . More than that though was the exceptional staff . They all remembered our names , were extremely helpful and friendly , and always asked if they could do anything for us . The b ##uff ##et was outstanding as well as the location . This was the kids first time to Chicago and they now want to make it an annual trip . When asked if they would like to stay elsewhere , we received a re ##sound ##ing NO ! The youngest just kept remark ##ing how friendly everyone was . We will definitely be staying with you again ! Thank you for such great hospitality ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the She ##rato ##n Grand on December 28th , 2017 . My daughter and 2 granddaughter ##s and myself stayed there for a little get ##away and to see Wicked . The staff was so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Te ##id ##ra at the front desk went out of her w ##y to make sure the girls had a memorable stay . We had an upgrade on our room and the view of the lake was breath ##taking . Everyone from the parking attendant to the con ##cier ##ge we ##n out of their way to answer questions . The accommodation ##s were so comfortable - - She ##rato ##n has the best beds ! We will be back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for vacation . Great location , walking distance from lots of the main things to see . Food was good but could be very slow in the bar at times . Con ##cier ##ges were excellent , very helpful and know ##led ##gable . Found it odd that room did not get serviced unless we asked for it . We use the Do Not Di ##st ##ur ##b sign at night as we are not very early rise ##rs and don ##t want maid ##s knocking on the door early . But even though we removed it around 9 . 00 ##am the room did not get serviced while we were out during the day . Seems an odd USA thing as have found same issue elsewhere in US but never in the rest of the world . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really awesome hotel . It had old world charm but all the modern stuff that I needed ( like built in USB charge ##rs ) . The full size s ##ham ##po ##o and such for use were also awesome . The location was nice - easily walk - able neighborhood feel with shopping and restaurants nearby . The Te ##sla show ##room is next block over - so fun to see ! The staff was amazing . The first night was paid by the conference I was attending and I extended the trip for personal time . They made it a sea ##m ##less experience so that all I had to do was pay my portion of the bill . Everyone else from the door ##man to house ##keeping were also friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Like ##d the suite accommodation ##s for families . Friendly , helpful staff . Clean rooms . Had to call for extra towels and toilet paper . Room had only one extra roll of toilet paper each day and with fi ##bri ##ls sharing the room , the toilet paper and towels were at a premium ! But staff responded quickly and were always friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Try to get a room above the 9th floor because its on a busy street also ask for a river view . Our room was so sweet it had two window seats the one was 6 ##ft x 4 ##ft the other was smaller but both with cushion ##s and pillows . Friendly Staff and they worked with us on everything . Warning not every floor has a ice machine so when you leave your room take your ice bag so you can stop and get ice on your return and not have to go to the room to get your bag then to another floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , beautiful hotel but service was terrible . Every restaurant we went to , they were extremely mean and un ##friend ##ly . We left each restaurant feeling beat up . Restaurant staff is mean and they treat you like garbage . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in the king j ##ac ##uz ##zi suite , and it was great except for two things . The first thing was the noise from the train . We were on the 17th floor right above the tracks , and that ’ s all we could hear all night . Second was the fact that there is no microwave , and a tiny fridge . We went out to dinner and had no way to re ##heat our left ##overs . Besides the train noise ruin ##ing our “ relaxing ” night , the stay was great . The bed was comfortable and the j ##ac ##uz ##zi tub was nice and big enough for two . The staff was very friendly and helpful . The room was on the smaller side for a suite but that doesn ’ t really bother us . I would recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My girlfriend ##s and I had a quick 24 hour trip to Chicago and love to stay at the Hilton Chicago . From the moment we walked in the door , we were treated like family . We highly recommend the breakfast b ##uff ##et . Benito our server was delight ##ful , and Gustavo makes the B ##ES ##T o ##mel ##et . Don ’ t miss a stay at the Hilton Chicago . Be sure to visit the work ##out facility and sit outside ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time staying at this hotel . Service was very good and the room was nice . The location is great . Walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars . There was a little noise from the overhead metro , but not bad . I will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bed was so big and the shower was THE B ##ES ##T . We had a standard king room . I wish v ##alet or parking was included in the stay but it was $ 69 which ends up being cheaper than some overnight parking in Chicago . Overall , the price was great and the rooms were so nice we will continue to stay here in the future . We had an issue where we warned v ##alet that we would be leaving at 4 am and they said we could still v ##alet . They told us they were bringing our car around and then 20 minutes later they asked us if we were asking for our car . we waited 40 minutes for our car because the con ##cier ##ge said v ##alet was working when they had not even begun to work yet . not the v ##alet ' s fault but don ' t lie to your customer ' s front desk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , especially after all the re ##nova ##ting was done earlier this year . Room ##s ( actually suites ) are very nice and modern and comfortable and very functional , including the small kitchen with a full size refrigerator . Staff is very friendly and trying to give you the best hotel experience ever . Thanks Heidi for pointing out that " hidden " breakfast room where we could do a little company gathering and celebration before hitting on the town . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Room was so small , carpet was old and torn , the ta ##cks were exposed . I cut my foot open on them . No microwave in the room , re ##f ##rig was so full of priced crap that I didn ' t need I could put my own stuff in it . I was treated better at a P ##ear Tree hotel . . . . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed two nights in a King Water View Room and it was as nice as in the pictures on the She ##rato ##n Web ##site . Charlotte at the front desk was extremely nice and inform ##ative about the hotel property and Chicago in general . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time staying at this property . I loved it . It ' s located just steps away from the river . It also has easy access to the " L " . The gym had all the basic ##s and even had fly ##ers that gives different work out routines . Good size rooms with a giant window seat . We happened to walk in right after they cleaned our room one afternoon , not sure what they spray ##ed but it smelled so good . Check in was very easy and the staff was great and very helpful . What I love about Kim ##pton is they give high end service at the fraction of the high end price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was nice and clean but the rooms were incredibly small . Nothing like the pictures . Hard for me and my husband to walk around the bed it was so small . . however the shower was amazing ! Quiet and a decent location . Right down the block from water tower . But not close to the ma ##g mile [SEP]
1	[CLS] 5 stars for the hotel but 10 for the front desk representative . They are the face of the hotel so an easy and comfortable check in is crucial . T ##ER ##I ##K in particular noticed my day was not going so well . He did everything in his power to be kind and understanding and to reassure me my stay would be the best here . He was not wrong . My significant other and I had an amazing time . Thank you Te ##rik . Best , Bryan [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t know where to start . The staff were so friendly and excellent service . At the reception , there was Nelson , Ten ##ei ##sha , etc . very helpful . Trying to remember the other names . In the Market Place the ladies and the guys always greeting . Then there are others , the door ##men , security and bell boys , Charles in particular were out to help us , me and my wife . This was our first trip to Chicago , for our son ' s con ##vocation . With limited staff , Connie at Breakfast did an excellent service . The room was comfortable and clean . But you could see the room and the bathroom were dated with pop ##corn ceiling , and d ##rab bed Head ##board . Need ##s an update . Location was great ! We will definitely come back to this Hotel , when we visit Chicago next . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a suite with corner room so we could see the lake and the river , awesome view ! ! Hotel in general is in a great location to restaurants and attractions . Kids had pull out couch in one room with their own bathroom and TV and we had our own room and bathroom as well . Very clean and modern room . Everyone of the staff was pleasant when we crossed their paths . Breakfast in the a . m had a good spread although it was a ta ##d confusing on where to go at first . Vale ##t parking is available and the guys up front are excellent at getting you a taxi to anywhere . Nick is our favorite ! We would def stay here again when staying in the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Public Chicago is a very good choice when on vacation in Chicago . The location is perfect . Gold Coast is super close to the city center as well as to the beach and the area is quiet and very nice . It ' s easy to feel at home here . The hotel has good breakfast alternatives and a cool bar and restaurant , that is popular among hotel guests as well as residents . The rooms are rather big and t ##idy . Good W ##i - Fi options . Public Chicago is an overall superb experience and we will definitely be back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] P ##U ##BL ##IC has now become my favorite hotel in Chicago . The service , the room , and the 2 bars with a good happy hour and the P ##ump Room attached all make it a nice home away from home . The room service was very fast and the food excellent . I can ' t wait for my next trip back to Chicago so I can stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Visiting our daughter for weekend and enjoyed stay at Public . Perfect bout ##ique hotel and excellent location for weekend trip . Short walk to Michigan Ave and several great restaurants . Happy hour in Library Room was a lot of fun . Next time plan on dinner in the P ##ump Room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel accommodation ##s are nice . I spent a week at the hotel . Room was spot ##less . Maid service was impressive ##ly at ##ten ##tive . The room was spot ##less each day I returned . I think the front desk staff was the most impressive face ##t of the experience . Victoria was the absolute best from my desk / check in person I have interact ##ed with in a long time . Joshua who has the same role was also efficient , effective and very nice . I never do reviews . The staff was so nice , I was compelled to review them . They earned five stars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 2 nights . Q ##ua ##int old - school hotel with a lot of charm . Excellent lobby bar . Room was small and bathroom was smaller . My major issue was that the walls are paper and I was woken up by the person in the room next to me having 5 ##am conference calls . He wasn ' t loud , just talking in normal volume . The walls are so thin that I even heard the mum ##bling ##s of the people he was talking to . The bathroom was so small that I was concerned about falling into the tub when going to the bathroom , or falling into the toilet when coming out of the tub / shower . One last cherry on the top of this sun ##dae was that the elevators weren ' t working properly , so had to walk 7 flights of stairs when I didn ' t want to wait 10 - 15 minutes for an elevator . Will not stay at this property again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] really large place with two towers , stayed only one night . Maybe a reform would be good . location is perfect to visit the area , and lake side rent ##ing a bike just near by at mill ##eni ##um park . shopping is all in walking distance [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is located well and the staff and mostly friendly and helpful . Noise from the street does come up to the lower rooms and made it difficult to get a good night ' s sleep . I ' m sure there are sound barriers that can be added to the windows to help ; this would make staying at this location so much better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a perfect location and property for our recent business conference . I upgraded to Gold Room which provides access to ##15 ##th floor lounge with breakfast , re ##f ##resh ##ments , private con ##cier ##ge , and spa discount ##s in a lovely view setting . The spa was well managed and g ##rac ##ious . The hospitality of Andrew , the spa manager and Man ##dan ##a in Gold Lounge was so nice and made me feel right at home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chicago excellence / Tech sa ##v ##vy business travelers supported by professional modern staff , updated rooms and conference spaces . Convention areas are superb and supported with regular meals and coffee sessions [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Kim ##pton staff provided excellent service even before I arrived . My room was available early , allowing me to conduct a morning strategy meeting . The room was a perfect fit . My sister - who stayed over one night - loves the de ##cor and the clever bathroom . I do , too . Third stay for me and I ’ ll glad ##ly come back next year ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] To begin with the only negative , there was no con ##cier ##ge on duty during our most recent ( January 23 - 27 ) stay . Everything else , however , was positive — the large , well - designed , and comfortable room and bathroom ; the outstanding ##ly court ##eous service ; the excellent house ##keeping . The location is perfect . The breakfast ##s in the 20th - floor dining room are ta ##sty ; and the $ 20 per person restaurant allowance for Hilton Gold members is generous . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Robert Jones is excellent . He listen ##s well and meets all the needs of the travel ##er . We have deemed this our " go to " hotel when we don ' t want to return home to our Chicago suburb home . The pricing is wonderful which includes compliment ##ary happy hour and a breakfast . It ' s convenient ##ly located to theaters and wonderful restaurants . After enjoying Hamilton last night , it was wonderful to relax and enjoy the suite last evening . Please visit this hotel , you won ' t be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I live in the suburbs and love to stay at this location when we need a couple of nights in the city . It ' s well located , modern , and fun . We love the happy hour and breakfast . The staff is always friendly and helpful . Recently , we dropped our youngest off at college at UC ##hic ##ago . I mentioned to the desk clerk how exhausted we were after a full day of moving , and he upgraded us to a suite ! Very thoughtful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Public Hotel was a joy to stay while was in Chicago . They staff was excellent in their care and instructions . Even the v ##alet service and door ##man were excellent and made me feel right at home . The Bar area was co ##zy and had nice app ##eti ##zers there as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I generally loved everything about my stay at this hotel . The staff was nice , the room was clean , and the location was perfect . We were able to walk or take the subway everywhere we wanted to go to do the tourist stuff . The only issue I had was that I could not take a hot shower . I was told , by maintenance , that the hotel sometimes has issues with hot water in some of the rooms because of how old the hotel is . Luckily we were in Chicago in the summer so we did not mind the lack of hot water . That being said , I would 100 % stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I al ##way stay in this hotel when I travel to Chicago . The place is excellent and the people are very nice . I love the breakfast and the bread is done in the hotel everyday . Location is very nice and the rooms are well equipped . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time in Chicago and we cu ##dn ##t ask for a better base to see and do everything . . walked to everything from hotel . Hotel itself was lovely staff were great and always very helpful . we had a corner suite room on the 9th floor . . room was spacious and very modern . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a long weekend in Chicago and were looking forward to staying at this hotel . However , due to a death in the family , we had to cancel our plans . The hotel ' s cancellation policy is that the deposit is not returned . However , when we booked our room , we had to pre ##pa ##y for our entire stay , and the hotel would not re ##fu ##nd any of our money . Instead , they compromised and gave us a credit that has to be used within 6 months . Flight ##s aren ' t cheap for the next few weeks , and I don ' t think Chicago is terribly warm in the Winter . Therefore , I doubt we will be able to use that credit . Just terrible experience in such an unfortunate situation . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My family was gifted a wish for our son and our experience was so beautiful . The care this hotel took to put a smile on my son ' s face and that of my family was beyond words complete with a North Pole . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is seriously awesome . 12 + family members gathered at P ##U ##BL ##IC as a kind of HQ for our holiday reunion in Chicago . and everyone had nothing but great things to say about it . our room was beautiful , spacious and comfortable , clean and the like . so much so that this may be my first review online for anything . And the people there — Andre , Faith and James Her ##me ##z , in particular — were beyond kind and helpful . We had a couple folks with mobility issues , and while the hotel itself isn ' t totally AC ##A friendly ( a fair amount of stairs ) , the people who worked there really made such a difference in supporting and showing up for us . And we thought it was super reasonable price wise , given how nice it is . Thank you , all ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Hotel is located in the heart of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and was a wonderful place to stay while on business ! Staff are pleasant and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . The rooms are clean and attractive . I love that there was a designated work space separate from the bedroom to work in . I would highly recommend staying here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In these weird times where you imagine that they clean everything with an extra effort you still get surprises like chewed candy on the floor when arriving to your brand new " di ##sin ##fected " room . Our room had rusty paint and in general didn ' t feel clean at all . Not sure if Illinois is for ##bid ##ding " bell boys " but one would ' ve been of great help in this hotel since we are a family of four traveling with tons of baggage . The gym and all other amenities were closed . Only good thing is the fantastic location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came to Chicago for a long weekend . Palmer House is central ##ly in the loop . It is accessible to subway . We walked to theatre for Hamilton . Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Ave are just outside the door . And , what a lobby ! ! ! Nice gym , indoor pool and steam room . Friendly and helpful staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location walking distance to most of the places you want to visit in Chicago . The staff was great . Value of the suite was fair , accommodate ##d our family of five in one suite . While the hotel is older as are the rooms , it was clean , and the included compliment ##ary breakfast reduced our meal cost and was a full meal ! The staff were very friendly . My son enjoyed the work ##out room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A bit price ##y for room size and service , smaller than expected and dining experience was slow . Good location , lobby and marketplace are nice but the rooms seems to be out ##dated and not " business " friendly compared to other downtown Chicago hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book on 3rd party ? Get ready to be treated like an Un ##des ##ira ##ble guest ! Philosophy : How can we squeeze every Penny out of you & we D ##ON ’ T like your Kids ! $ 71 ( Vale ##t Only All ##owed ! ) Want a higher floor ? $ 30 - 40 ! 2 beds ? $ 75 more per night ! Need a Micro ##wave or Warm ##ed up food for your baby ? None in Hotel / Restaurant AND Staff ask you to Leave Hotel to find another means ! Tiny Room ##s & NO ##T on the Mile . F ##als ##e advertising ! 4 . 5 star ? ! ? Ye ##a right ! W ##OR ##ST hotel in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] So the lobby , the meeting areas were all really nice . The rooms . . . well , they felt a bit dated compared to some of the other places in the city where I like to stay . But was on a budget and needed to stretch the dollars some so this place made do . Would not hesitate to recommend someone staying here unless you are looking for a 5 Star type resort hotel . This is NO ##T that . It is a safe , well - located , business person ' s hotel . Although there is a Spa here , I did not have time to take advantage of it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can not r ##ave enough about my stay . Everything was very clean . The staff was super friendly . It was close to the conference we attended and plenty of other places . Very impressed with the breakfast and evening social . I would come and stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel w ##owed me ! Clean up to date friendly the rooms were so ##oo clean & luxurious ! ! The bed was the best I ##ve ever slept in ( mine at h ##m wasn ##t this com ##fy at $ 4 ##k no joke ) slept like a baby . W ##ore shorts & t ##shirt ##s the whole trip no problem . The rest ##ra ##unt 5 star worthy . The wait staff & chef ##s professional & w ##ow the food was great ! ! ! This hotel was one I did not want to leave . Its definitely the only hotel for me in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location to the Gold Coast and easy walk , u ##ber or taxi ride over to the ma ##g mile . The hotel is very nice , clean and feels open with all the white d ##é ##cor . I enjoy staying here . I come to Chicago at least two times per year and want to stay here for most of trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A nice old 4 star but definitely not a luxury Fair ##mont . Great location and excellent services . Room is large but needs some work . Not very family friendly . There is no swimming pool or fitness center . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable beds ( luxury king ) . Room ##s well equipped . All the lights worked ( how many times can you say that ? ! ) . Very clean and attractive bath / shower . Great central location . Room service was friendly and court ##eous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here 2 nights in July with my boyfriend . The bed was super com ##fy , loved the window seat . Very clean and nice de ##cor . The staff was all very friendly and called us by name . They had ice ##d and hot coffee in the lobby in the morning , which made up for the lack of coffee maker in the room . The restaurant across the street had an amazing b ##urger , we ordered one for take ##out late at night instead of ordering room service . We had breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and the food was very good . Not sure if the juice ##s are really " freshly squeezed " but good nonetheless . I would definitely stay here again as well as other Kim ##pton hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service , great accommodation ##s , great location . We had an app ##t . with the Italian Consul ##ate which was directly across the street . The Hotel restaurants are very good . We ate at both of them . Vale ##t parking was very convenient , everyone was very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in Chicago for a business trip . Hector checked us in and provided us with great service . He upgraded our room which was most appreciated . The room was great with a nice view of the city . The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the pool also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel to Chicago quarterly ( for business ) and the Monaco is the only place I ' ll stay . They have the best staff , clean ##est rooms , and a convenient bar / restaurant attached . It ' s also in an awesome location - walking distance to the Lake ##front trail , bars , night ##life , etc . I would highly recommend staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is amazing . I came for my 21st birthday weekend with my boyfriend and they surprised me with cake and drinks . David ( hotel manager ) was the best . He texted me through out my stay to see how my stay was going , giving us recommendations , and made us feel welcome ! The rooms were very clean and nice . You definitely get your money ’ s worth . I will definitely be back on my next visit . - Diamond [SEP]
1	[CLS] I dropped a pen on the floor and found a plane ticket from 2016 ! ! Obviously room hasn ’ t been cleaned very well in 2 years ! ! It is a lovely hotel in a great location . . . . but definitely in need of a spring clean ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Hotel and great service . Room ##s are very large . However , the manner in which they Hotel implements technology is a little interesting . The TV in the bedroom is , or at least in the room I had set to the side of the room , and not on a s ##wi ##vel . Little let down for this hotel . In addition , it seemed as if they were trying to hide the electrical shade controls as they were difficult to find behind a lamp . Same for the electrical outlet near the bed which 99 percent of persons would use to charge a phone while sleeping . They hide the outlets which are mounted to the night stand but blocked by the mattress , which was of a very low quality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Help ##ful staff . Clean . Love ##d it ! Breakfast and wine hour nice addition . It was an easy walk to everything . The river walk was a block away . The loop is close by . E ##asily walk ##able with food nearby [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able stay in a convenient location . Price was decent as well . The d ##é ##cor was fresh and modern . Had an excellent meal with wonderful service at The Palm which is located inside the hotel . Help at the door with luggage / curb ##side taxi was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was fantastic ! ! ! When the u ##ber driver pulled up I realized I was booked at the hotel where The Fu ##git ##ive was filmed . I was welcomed by a great door staff , walked into the beautiful lobby and greeted at the elevator by management on lobby duty . What a warm welcome ! I loved using the digital key so I could go straight to my room . The room i had was gorgeous ! 2 bathroom ##s . . . w ##ow . I didn ’ t need 2 but how cool . I ate at Kitty O ’ Shea ’ s in the lobby . A ##wes ##ome corn beef sandwich and ta ##sty ma ##rt ##ini . Wonderful stay in Chicago ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has tons of history and doesn ’ t live up to its g ##lam ##orous past . The king room was good size by downtown Chicago standards and had nice chair and flat screen TV . Bath ##room was small but functional . Maid service was on point . The overall staff was just average not very welcoming . Good location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel for traveling with little ones . The suite provides a lot of space for families . The staff was friendly and hand delivered milk and cookies to our son . G ##ior ##dan ##o ’ s pizza is 2 blocks away and it ’ s directly across the street from Z ##ara ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love this hotel . We stay here every Christmas week , and usually use this hotel for our anniversary or whenever we need a night in downtown Chicago . It ' s clean , modern , has great rooms that are not decorated in the typical hotel room manner . Get the River View room , corner room is the best . All ##ows pets as well . Park ##ing is v ##alet and price ##y , but there aren ' t many other choices . Worth it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The heat ##er and the ##rm ##ost ##at were both ma ##lf ##un ##ction ##ing and I simply froze , as Chicago was experiencing record breaking cold temperatures . They finally “ tripped ” the heat in my room at 6 : 00 a . m . Fr ##ust ##rating [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a beautiful view of Lake Michigan from the 19th floor , very nice room , well appointed . But they need more staff at the front desk . Both times I had to visit the front desk I was first in line , but waited an extra ##ord ##ina ##rily long time for someone to free up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] ch ##ica ##go in de ##ce ##mber wouldn ' t have been my first choice , but was tag ##ging along with my fi ##an ##cé on travel for business and was treated to some fairly mild weather which allowed us to explore the city a bit . thanks to this central location , we could easily get out and explore on foot , and fell in love with the city every step of the way . the mon ##aco is a great representation of the k ##im ##pton brand - q ##ui ##rky , luxurious , and welcoming - we felt equally at home and p ##amp ##ered the entire time . try s ##na ##gging a room with a window seat and you ' ll absolutely love the river view ! this has been my favorite k ##im ##pton property to date . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ground ##s , room and service was excellent . But the executive breakfast was not acceptable or edible . Need more help at the front desk . Facility is beautiful . Night time bar area was good . Dr ##ink ##s were ta ##sty [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel ' s location is very good . It ' s near the Red Line for transportation . It ' s also close to re ##saur ##ants , shopping and entertainment . A full breakfast is included in the price . There is also an evening reception . The rooms are spacious . Bed ##s and bed ##ding were comfortable . We had one of the hotel ' s recently re ##mo ##del ##ed suites . We were most impressed by the at ##ten ##tive ##ness of the entire hotel staff . Wonderful stay ! We will definitely be repeat guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great experience overall . . . wonderful room , wonderful front desk and house ##keeping staff . The front desk went out of their way to find an excellent special room . The only problem at all was the main lobby restaurant had ok food but very sub par service . We ordered b ##urger ##s at 2 : 30 pm when the place was nearly empty and it took 1 hour for them to make it to our table . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister and I stayed March 4 through the 6th . Perfect from check - in until check - out ! Front desk service was extremely g ##rac ##ious and professional . The bar in the lobby was a great place to relax after a day in the snow . Will definitely return . Special thanks to Melissa ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] You couldn ' t find a better place , location , services and amenities were outstanding . It was beautifully decorated for the holiday . The H ##ya ##tt team where very professional and court ##eous . I felt as though I was a valued guest . This was not my first stay at the H ##ya ##tt and certainly will return for future stays when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When you walk into the lobby you will be amazed at how beautiful it is . It is one of the nice ##st ones we have been to . However it was Sandra at the front desk who really made our trip . She was amazing ! So helpful , kind , and fun . She was awesome every day during our 4 day stay . The rooms are im ##ma ##culate and beds are com ##fy . Our only complaint is that with a King Room , the bed takes up the entire room . I would suggest 2 doubles or a queen . However , sand ##ra being her amazing self was able to secure us a room that was quite amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago whenever we ’ re in town - the suites are room ##y and really reasonably priced for the area , and the 67 ##6 restaurant and bar is te ##rri ##fic . During this trip , we arrived early and the hotel was able to accommodate us with an 11 am check in . We had room service several times and the food was great . The bartender ##s at the 67 ##6 bar are awesome - several even remembered me from prior visits ! The pool area is small but nicely kept and a great place for kids to un ##wind after a day doing tourist ##y stuff . We ’ ll be back again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The ambassador hotel is a ch ##ic property a stones throw away from some of the best shopping and entertainment that Chicago has to offer . El ##egan ##tly appointed with fantastic staff , this is a g ##em of a property [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is lovely , our king room was large , attractive & clean . The location near the River ##walk is great . On the lower level is a cafe where it doesn ' t cost an arm and a leg for breakfast . In the room is a peculiar little white lamp whose function b ##af ##fled me ; it certainly was no good to read by , so I would have pre ##ff ##red a real lamp ( One night table had one ) . The room was priced reasonably but then the v ##alet parking was $ 69 per night . That ' s a bit much . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed 3 nights for a conference being held in the hotel . The room , although a bit small , was clean and comfortable , as was the king size bed . The lighting was good , and it was very quiet at night . The w ##if ##i was fast and reliable . As this is an older hotel , the elevators are a little smaller than modern ones , and operate a little slower than expected . So there was sometimes a wait to access them . However , I easily found the stairs and used them a few times . Although not immediately adjacent to the L or the subway , there were numerous bus lines on nearby Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got this place by chance on Hot ##wire and we are glad we did . The staff could not have been friend ##lier , the beds were very comfortable and the hotel overall was very nice . It is 1 block off Michigan Ave so a little less traffic if wanting to relax outside on the couch ##es . I would love to stay here again if we go back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Main plus for this bout ##ique hotel is its location . It is located in a walking distance from main tourist attractions in Chicago downtown . Also there are a number of nice restaurants and bars in a spit ##ting distance . Room was comfortable and clean . Service was nice and helpful . N ##eg ##ative comment is for a breakfast - it is served on every floor in the lift lobby area - and is the same every day . After taking a tray with food , you need to come back to the room and eat . Overall : great value for the money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] IT was a triple " A " experience starting from Check in by MR ER ##EN until I step out . De ##fin ##ite ##ly w ##ld be my first option again on my next trip . The breakfast including bread and c ##rois ##san ##t were delicious . Thanks to all staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and was totally pleased with the accommodation ##s . Nice room amenities and service / staff were always very friendly and helpful . Only thing the room was missing was a small room refrigerator / microwave to be used by the guest . Would be helpful and appreciated if rooms were updated to include those two amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location easy to get to and from all places of interest . All services were above par and all personnel eager to assist . We would not hesitate to re ##book this hotel on any future trips to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The warm ##est reception from the Wind ##y City . . From the pickup at the airport to our departure they made sure we were all taken care of . . The breakfast was to die for . . The de ##cor & amenities were amazing . . My room was nothing short of total awesome ##ness L ##OL ( 121 ##7 I believe , Michigan Ave view ) . . De ##fin ##ite ##ly looking forward to visiting this lovely property and city again , but this time it will definitely be in the summer = ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] After staying in another property earlier in the week that afforded little sleep because of the noise , the Fair ##mont was a welcomed re ##sp ##ite . A quiet corner room . Event ##ho it was next to the elevators , I never heard them . Big bathroom , bigger room and view of the lake . Finally a place open at 6 ##am for breakfast ! Wonderful for an early bird like me . Mo and I had the best chat ##s over cap ##pu ##cci ##nos . The conference staff were pro ##active , friendly and helpful for the meeting . I love it when everything goes smoothly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was beautiful and the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I ’ ve ever slept in . The property is perfectly located close to shopping and great restaurants . A big shout out to Peter at the con ##cier ##ge desk who booked ex ##cursions and restaurants for us and nail ##ed it every time . He was great as were all of the staff members we encountered . Wouldn ’ t hesitate to stay at this hotel again . Just a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel with very helpful staff . The position of the hotel is in a quiet location but is in easy reach to all the main attractions . The rooms are clean with very com ##fy beds . . . . would definitely stop here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fun ##ctional hotel in downtown Chicago . Location is perfect , rooms are great and outdoor terrace expensive but a great addition only few other hotels have in the area . Higher price segment but overall well worth it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful way to spend time in Chicago , you can walk everywhere . Everyone at the Monaco , from the reservations , door ##man , con ##cier ##ge , front desk , room service , could not have been more friendly . Del ##ight ##ful surprise - we were upgraded to a corner river - view room , with a free bottle of wine and a " Happy Anniversary " note . I thought the reservation clerk was just making small talk when asking if our stay was celebrating something special . I ' m awful at remembering names but everyone on staff this past weekend was te ##rri ##fic . Next time we won ' t wait so long between visits . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Be ##ware this is an old hotel with awkward floor layout ##s and no sound proof ##ing . This is not a hotel for business travelers who are looking for modern rooms and effective customer service . In my experience the customer service of this hotel is overwhelmed with the volume of rooms and the expectations of a business travel ##er . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Si ##mp ##ly sleek and elegant hotel . You are warmly greeted and treated throughout your stay . The rooms , lobby , and restaurant are modern , clean , and taste ##fully decorated . No detail is overlooked . Fantastic location within walking distance of shopping , transit , and tourist attractions . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was ideal ##ly located , which was great for visiting Chicago . The room for two ( two twin beds ) was nice . The beds were comfortable , the bathroom bright and well maintained . The staff was kind , polite , cheerful , and helpful . We will come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I only had one negative . My company purchase a glass a wine or beer for everyone that checked in . I was told I had to go to the bar and could not received room service . Due to my schedule I was not able to go to bar as I was still working in my room because of the time restraint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the She ##rato ##n is first class ! Heidi , who checked us in and out , provided us exceptional service with a genuine friend ##liness that set the tone for our stay . The rooms had all the details right - plus ##h towels , great pillows and bed ##ding , a large mirror with multiple outlets outside the bathroom and a ceramic coffee mug with Star ##bu ##cks coffee ! Ad ##d that to prime location and this will be the only place we stay on future Chicago trips ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff are great ! The staff went above and beyond for a request I had and checked in frequently via text to see if I needed anything . The rooms are a ta ##d small but it had everything I needed and the bed was comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ( Gerry Medina and Drake Lu ##k ##wa ##go ) . Everyone was friendly and helpful . I love the free breakfast provided on every floor and the rooms were very nice and clean . They also have a free happy hour . How can you go wrong ! Great location too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean and very professional from bell hop ##s , con ##cier ##ge service , front desk check in , maid staff , bar staff and meeting rooms . Room ##s were clean and comfortable . Lots of pillows and towels . G ##ym was very well appointed . 5 minute walk to miracle mile and many restaurants . I will come back [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a perfect location close to shopping and sights ##ee ##ing . Star ##bu ##cks on the lower level . Large bar with beautiful lounge area connected to the lobby . Room ##s are updated and very clean . Overall very nice hotel and priced reasonably . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As an annual visitor to Chicago to watch the Bears ( who by the way are just so bad ! ! ) , could be off visiting the awesome city of Chicago . This is my 3rd visit to Home ##wood suites within the last year , they have never disappointed . On this particular visit i had the studio suite , it was perfect . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast is really good , the staff on front desk are always so helpful . Better yet its next door to my favourite steak restaurant Joe ’ s . Not the even the visit of Trump on his first visit to Chicago since he took office when I was there , would put me off returning to East Grand Hilton . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I decided to take a last minute trip to Chicago and needed a hotel . I found Hotel All ##egro at a great price . The hotel was beautifully decorated in the art de ##co style . The room was on the smaller side but it was perfect for me since I was traveling solo . There is also a happy hour from 5 - 6 daily , where you can get you Pro ##se ##cco fix . It is central ##ly located near plenty of great restaurants and shopping . Leah R . at the front desk was AM ##A ##Z ##ING and was always happy to answer my questions and drop recommendations for some of her favorite nearby spots . If i am ever in Chicago again , I would definitely stay at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Long que ##ue to the reception , noisy room ( it seems the train was crossing the room ) , a smell of m ##ou ##ld . Dirty , poor air conditioning Limited selection for an expensive breakfast Fitness not included in the price of the room [SEP]
1	[CLS] Po ##ked on the Executive level ( paid extra ) only to find out the Executive level service was barely none ##xi ##sten ##t . Three crap ##py l ##uke warm app ##eti ##zers and cold breakfast b ##uff ##et . Staff was helpful and did re ##fu ##nd some points to my account . But , from what was a prior experience to this recent experience turned me off . Room was clean , but paint was p ##eel ##ing off the bathroom door . In - room phone broken and TV reception was poor . It wasn ’ t until next morning the TV menu worked . Too many other options in Chicago . Don ’ t plan on making this hotel an option next visit [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfectly located at the north end of Michigan a ##ve , walking distance to all the shopping , near avenue 64 beach , and the restaurants and bars on Rush s ##t . Park ##ing can be expensive so we use the parking pan ##da app and usually get by under $ 30 . Great rooms , service and location . We ' ll stay here again . [SEP]

Dr ##ink ##s were served in a time ##ly manner and music selection was on point ! ! He was very friendly with all the guest and made us feel welcomed ! ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly excited for more happy hours in the future ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed for a long family weekend . Property was close to family friendly restaurants and a short U ##ber ride to the museum campus . Daughter loved swimming in the evenings and we appreciated the kitchen ##ette in our room so we could just order a pizza on a night when we were too worn out to go out . Whole family loved the full breakfast . All of the staff at Home ##wood Suite ##s was very helpful and friendly . We will stay here again when we visit Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at the All ##egro several times , and it is a reliable and unique place . Be prepared for small bathroom ##s , but you will appreciate the creativity of the design in making the fixtures use the appropriate amount of space without losing functionality . The staff is at ##ten ##tive and helpful . The v ##alet ##s and bell ##men are knowledge ##able and efficient at check - in and check - out , as well as hail ##ing cab ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This brand new hotel is fantastic ! I was accidentally booked at the wrong Hilton for a conference , but I ended up the winner ! Service is top - notch , wine bar excellent , rooms are modern and technology advanced . I will choose this hotel next time ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand is a go - to hotel for me when visiting downtown given its proximity to Chicago Booth MBA campus and the great restaurants & bars on Michigan avenue . The rooms are clean and well appointed and they have good in - house restaurants . Hotel is situated next to the river , offering excellent views and easy access to the river architecture cruise ( which is worth doing ) . It is a 3 min walk to Michigan Ave and I enjoy the fresh air and views - more so than staying on Michigan Ave proper . Note : This is a big hotel that holds lots of conferences . It is close to the Pier ( 5 min walk ) and is central to most of the key areas / attractions downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this property for 6 nights on business . The location on Michigan Avenue was convenient for access to local restaurants and shopping . Nice Herb N ’ Kitchen Cafe that featured Star ##bu ##cks . Kitty O ’ Shea ##s is a local favorite too . Staff was friendly and check in went smoothly . Make sure to join Hilton Honors for free W ##i ##F ##i . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el was lovely . The beds are super comfortable . A very European hotel and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Great location near the Water Tower area and nice restaurants . I would most definitely stay in this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Price ##d very well for Chicago downtown . Fantastic location ! ! Staff was very nice , room super clean . Beautiful bath , com ##fy bathroom . Room itself a bit on the small side but what you typically get in Chicago . We will return ! Do not park here ( expensive ! ) Ch ##ea ##per across street , much cheaper down a block . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a very beautiful , historic hotel . We had Edward check us in and he was very polite and professional . Was there for a business conference and enjoyed the location of the hotel and the historic am ##bian ##ce of the building ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Luckily , this hotel is not just another business hotel . It ' s unique , with an individual style . The rooms have a unique interior . I loved the paintings in my room and the huge mirror . And , there is an exquisite lobby and bar area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great Stay ! Typical Fair ##mont quality of hotel . Everything you ' d expect from a Fair ##mont hotel . Hotel is central ##ly located . Room Service was as expected of Fair ##mont quality . Check ##out was a breeze . I would definitely return to stay at the Fair ##mont Chicago hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Make sure to call ahead and confirm if you want lake view or river view . All river view rooms as advertised as lake / river and when you arrive of ##course all lake view is sold . Calling ahead won ' t confirm the room type . Then they promise you rewards and get your number but give you no credit . Had 11 nights with ma ##rri ##ot / s ##p ##g in the past year and with some excuse or the other they won ' t credit any stays . Mar ##riot ##t hotels are fine but customer service is ##hor ##ren ##do ##us . Had to call 3 times and was on the phone for over 2 hours . Just un ##believable ! ! ! Next time I continue wit hilt ##on which is way way better in every way . Below is the live screen shot of being on hold with no one returning or a ##pol ##og ##izing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent service from a v ##alet parking to check - in and though ##out my stay ! Staff was polite , efficient and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . Had a challenge with a Fed ##E ##x shipment which was resolved quickly . I will be back to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed overnight at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker hotel for a business trip . Hotel is located in the shopping district of Chicago near Rush Street where there are tons of bars and restaurants . Check - in was easy and the staff were very friendly . Hotel has a small gym which was convenient . Rate which was a business rate was very affordable . Overall I would recommend anyone wishing a clean , affordable hotel in a great area of Chicago ( near the Hancock building ) check out the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . You won ' t be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Hilton for a conference and combined some personal time while there . We were upgraded to a lake view suite and the room and view was awesome . Unfortunately , there is not an executive lounge but was able to have breakfast in the restaurant instead . My wife and I enjoyed our stay . We also took some late night walks down to the Buckingham Fountain . We also visited the Chicago History museum . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location for conference - can use CT ##A from Midway airport . $ 3 fare each way . Kind of noisy at night ( city sounds ) . C ##as ##ual eat ##ery - Herb and Kitchen was helpful for quick pan ##ini or o ##at ##me ##al for breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Three friends and I stay at The Ambassador every time we are in Chicago . Great location away from the crowds downtown . It is located in a quiet neighborhood , but is close enough to walk to attractions , restaurants and bars . Never have had a bad experience . Will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always so happy when I stay here ! Great location , excellent staff and com ##fy accommodation ##s . Bath products are my very favorite . You could find very reasonable overnight parking near by . Don ' t hesitate to book here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Del ##ight ##ful surprise to find such a pleasant stay at a reasonable price in the heart of Chicago . Location perfect ; welcome and v ##alet friendly and efficient ; room was lovely and clean ; service outstanding ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is excellent . Big rooms , well appointed and very clean . The staff are extremely helpful . I arrived early in the morning and from the moment the car door was opened by Will the Door ##man I knew i w ##old be well looked after . The reception staff found a room quickly and from th ##t point on I had no complaints . Good location , excellent service - everything you need . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ll keep it short and sweet . We had our annual Christmas at the pump room in the lobby Great food , experienced bartender ##s , clean rooms , and exceptional hotel staff . Are you looking for a low key high end hotel room that is central ##ly located in downtown Chicago ? If yes , than the Public is for you ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We saw a good deal on line plus they take dogs . It ’ s a nice central location in River North near the Trump Tower . Roses - morning co ##ffe and evening wine hour . Room ##ed were nice with comfortable beds . The attached restaurant , Fi ##sk & co is a good food option . Thorn ##s - plug ins need up ##dating , they are for early version apple products . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel location , if Michigan at the river is desirable , works for many tourists . Service from all was excellent . Room is adequate and house ##keeping was good . Only complaint was rate was higher than other comparable hotels . This would be ok if you walked into the lobby and thought O ##MG this place is great . . . . but that is not the case . Like I said in the title - this is a good well managed hotel - but it is a poor value in comparison to say . . . . the Ra ##dis ##son Blu which is close by , newer and more than $ 100 less per night or hotels costing more but with more impressive facilities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Stay , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Hotel , great views to Lake Michigan . Strange elevator system though but once you get the hang of it it ' s all good . Own ##ed by the Swiss Tourism Group , it ' s a very comfortable existence for a good nights sleep . Overall , I loved my stay at Swiss ##ote ##l - I guess the elevator is European or something : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great from the Door ##ste ##p to the room to the Happy hour ! Just a delight ##ful staff . . . helpful , court ##eous , and all with a smile ! Location location location . . . w ##ow . thank you so much for making my whole family feel at home . Can ' t wait to return . DL [SEP]
1	[CLS] Classic hotel in a perfect location near Oak Street Beach , top notch shopping , great restaurants , etc . The room was a bit tight , but room ##y enough . Bath ##room had rain shower , a modern touch . Coffee provided in - room . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ra ##n into a few issues but the manager was good about making sure the issues were resolved and followed up . Nice area to sit with friends on the lobby floor . love that it is new and it is very clean . Staff are friendly but the bar is focused more on food and the drinks were not amazing . They do not have a full bar and therefore weren ' t able to make drinks like Cho ##cola ##tin ##i . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the She ##rato ##n and did enjoy the view and location . The plus ##es : great view from room ( see photos ) , 1 block from Whole ##food ##s , Star ##bu ##cks downstairs in hotel , room was nice . Min ##uses : walls are thin , I could hear people on both sides , room service crazy expensive ( $ 50 b ##fast ) , can ’ t order lunch room service . It ’ s also pretty corporate ##ly , fine for business but a bit imp ##erson ##al for pleasure trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We live in the Chicago suburbs and like to spend an occasional night in the city . We have tried a number of hotels in the River North / Ma ##g Mile / Loop areas and this is one of the best for its value and comfort . You get al ##ot of " extra ##s " - free breakfast , free drink at happy hour , free app ##eti ##zer bar , H ##2 ##O + amenities in the bathroom - without the huge room price . The location is fantastic ( kid ##die corner from Siena Tavern which I highly recommend ) with easy access to Navy Pier , the River ##walk , and Michigan Ave . Really liked Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel , will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed 5 nights at this hotel , i would like to inform people looking to stay here , the F ##RE ##E internet advertised at this hotel actually costs you $ 15 dollars per day . you will find this out when they and you a bill for facility fees for each day of your stay . this is what happened when i checked out , when you ask what the fee is for , they say it is to pay for the internet coverage , even though they say it is F ##RE ##E and when you log on to the hotel internet it also states it is F ##RE ##E . Come on Mill ##eni ##um Hotels stop treating guests this way , if you want to charge $ 15 dollars per day per room at least let the customer know . you let yours ##elves down [SEP]
0	[CLS] We traveled to Chicago for a friends wedding at the inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal in July The hotel was busy but the front desk did check us in in a time ##ly manner . In the room there were a few problems with the room . I called down to the front desk and they took care of it quickly . We went to a reception in the hotel . The food was good as well as the drinks . If you are looking for a hotel close to everything I would recommend staying . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My baby c ##ri ##b was not delivered in time . I cleaned the railing ##s and wiped the bed sheet and filled 2 hand towels with black dust . They gave me a large bath towel ( in the baby c ##ri ##b ) as a blanket ? Not sure its purpose . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 2 nights at this lovely hotel at the start of our holiday . rooms were very clean and comfortable and the hotel is ideal ##ly located near Chicago ' s major attractions . Also plenty of good restaurants are nearby . [SEP]
0	[CLS] You can see the age of this hotel is starting to show , but overall I found it to be a really comfortable stay . The room I had was huge , and the bed was comfortable - as were all the amenities . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , staff very helpful and at ##ten ##tive , rooms great size and comfortable , all amenities you need coffee machine great too , restaurant very relaxing and friendly . Going back in a month for another visit , can ##t wait . X [SEP]
0	[CLS] We planned a three day Wedding Anniversary trip to Chicago and selected the H ##ya ##tt Regency for our stay . We had advised the staff we were celebrating our 55 ##th Anniversary . We were so surprised to not only have a room with a spectacular view , but they also had a beautiful fresh flower b ##ou ##quet and a chocolate cake waiting for us in our room ! The convenient location was just a short cab ride to everything we wanted to do and we had a wonderful time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While the rooms are small and basic , the hotel is central ##ly located and easy walking distance to many attractions and eating outlets . Noise from adjacent rooms can be of concern depending on your neighbours . The hotel is kept clean and the staff are friendly . Unfortunately the hotel used our credit card to book another room under a different name , which I only discovered when I check my credit card account . They also had a bar over ##cha ##rge on our bill . The errors were re ##fu ##nded when I contacted the hotel however no explanation was given . Warning : Check your credit card transactions for this hotel before leaving . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice atmosphere , v ##alet parking costs $ 72 . 00 but well worth it . We pulled up the took our luggage , checked us in and took our bags to our room . Very secure we had to use our room key card to activate the elevator to get to out room . We were on the 30th floor and the view was amazing . Location is excellent walking distance to Ma ##g mile , the lake and Di ##t ##kas is a block away . The rooms were very class ##y with full size toilet ##ries in the rest ##room . There were nice com ##fy robes . The beds and pillows are down so you sink in them and they are com ##fy . Overall I recommend this hotel for the price and location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great . Staff is friendly and helpful . The Market in the hotel is a nice option for grabbing a quick bite . They offer Star ##bu ##cks coffee and drinks , but it is not a full Star ##bu ##cks . Still it worked well for our needs . The rooms are comfortable and clean . The beds and pillows were very nice . The only criticism would be , the carpet in the room could have been a little cleaner , otherwise would have been 5 stars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in Chicago on a business trip . I booked a couple of months in advance with one request : please put me in a room away from the elevator . Of course , I was placed in a room as close to the elevator as possible . I politely pushed back but was met with pro ##mpt resistance that nothing could be done . A “ I ’ m sorry for the in ##con ##ven ##ience ” was ta ##cked on to the end of the rot ##e response . Of course , a wedding or two that weekend led to wave after wave of drunk guests continuing to party in the hotel hallway ##s into the night . For $ 370 . 00 a night , I expected a better - managed hotel . Chicago has a lot of choices . The Kim ##pton will not be one of them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a pleasure it was to stay at this amazing hotel . Room was spectacular . Ku ##dos to the interior designer nothing was missed . Great roof top , extremely friendly staff . I just booked to return next month . I stay in a different hotel each week and this is my new all time favorite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location around the corner from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! ! Love ##d how helpful staff was . Please note v ##alet parking was $ 67 a day but you can come and go . There is parking across from hotel at $ 42 a night but hourly during the day , so v ##alet was better . Get a Chicago Transit Authority ticket . $ 10 for unlimited rides and transfer for 24 hours to get around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pect ##ac ##ular service and accommodation ##s ! ! So easy to explore the area and sights . Very comfortable and relaxing with a great restaurant and bar included at the hotel . Staff very knowledge ##able about the area . Love ##d my stay and wished it never had to end . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed on this property a half dozen times and it is sub ##per ##b . Service is top notch . At ##ten ##tion to every detail is assured . The rooms are well appointed and good size . Location is ideal on the Gold Coast . Walk to an outstanding array of restaurants and clubs . Management truly cares about making your stay perfect . You name it , the Ambassador Chicago has it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The price was reasonable but we were disappointed in the service . The website indicated they had v ##alet parking , no ##pe . Had to pay an arm and a leg to park in a public garage blocks away . There were four of us in the room and it had 2 bath towels , no hand towels or wash ##cloth ##s . A call to the front desk resulted in a ridiculous ##ly long wait . Very few electrical outlets in the room . Would not stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying here with my wife for a quick anniversary trip . Price very reasonable compared to comparable places in the loop . Good location . Really liked the combination of historic building , but sleek modern lobby and finishes . Art de ##co feel but fresh . Nice lobby and bar to hang out , including coffee and tea bar in the morning which was appreciated . The kicker was that this hotel went above and beyond on our room and accommodation ##s . I asked for a high floor and mentioned this was for an anniversary trip - we were given free upgrade to high - floor suite , prose ##cco on ice in the room , cake , and a hand - written card con ##gra ##tu ##lating us . Very nice touches and much appreciated ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at the Inter ##cin ##tinent ##al was great . Thus i ##a our 2nd time at the hotel and it does not di ##ssa ##point . The service continues to be top notch and the location is un ##beat ##able . Would highly recommend ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always stay at the O ##m ##ni when visiting Chicago . They make you feel so welcome , from the v ##alet / door ##men to the greet ##er in the lobby to the reservation desk to the maid ##s and maintenance workers . The employees really make you feel welcome . Every word is delivered with a smile . I have not experienced this anywhere else . Co ##up ##le that with the comfortable beds , spacious suites and great restaurant , there is no other place for us ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is very convenient and walk ##able . All staff we encountered had excellent customer service . Bed ##s are very com ##fy ! Bath ##room is a bit tight but great amenities . It took us a day to find the coffee pot . Fe ##lt safe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An elegant 1920s - era hotel convenient ##ly located near all downtown attractions , Navy Pier , Millennium Park , Water Tower Place , River Walk , Tribune Tower . Our rooms and service were excellent . Hotel staff were very helpful . Re ##quest ##ed late check ##out and were accommodate ##d easily . The Roman - style swimming pool is worth a look even if you don ' t swim . Located just a few blocks from the Red Line CT ##A stop on Grand Street , but if you walk , be aware that Grand goes UN ##DE ##R Michigan Avenue , so you have to climb a stairway to get to the hotel . L ##y ##ft would not pick up on Michigan Ave , so we had to walk to a side street for pickup . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check - in was very easy and fast . The room was always clean and comfortable . The staff was very friendly and at ##ten ##tive . We ate breakfast in their restaurant two mornings and dinner once . Their Happy Hour provided some cheap drinks and bar food . The one negative is the availability of parking in the neighborhood . The hotel is in a primarily residence area and has very restrict ##ive parking . The hotel has a parking lot where they v ##alet for $ 67 / night or you can self park for $ 45 / night . I didn ’ t want to pay that much for parking so I drove around looking for parking . Each time I passed their lot , I found it empty except for maybe two cars . I assume everybody else didn ’ t want to pay that much either . They should drop their parking prices so that the parking lot gets used . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had to switch rooms due to over booking . We were given half off our rate however it was still an in ##con ##ven ##ience . There were suppose to be ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres each night . On Sunday and Monday they gave us a coup ##on for app ##eti ##zers in the restaurant . When we went in to the restaurant they told us that we only had one choice which was spring rolls . I have two children and that is not kid friendly . That is not what we are used to when staying at the Palmer House . We were very disappointed . Each morning there were pipes that rattled at 5 : 30 am which woke me up . Very annoying . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked the room for Labor Day weekend . I had questions before my arrival concerning transit from the airport and around town . The hotel staff was very helpful both before my arrival and during my stay . The location was close to the ' L ' and within walking distance of many restaurants , tourist attractions downtown . I will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The inter ##continent ##al is a beautiful hotel that offers outstanding service . The staff are friendly and helpful . The bar is a great place to get a good glass of wine . We enjoyed one of their flat ##bre ##ads , which was outstanding . Great location . High ##ly recommend it if you want service and an experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was really great ! I came for a psychology conference and really got to enjoy my stay in Chicago , with the hotel playing a large role . The rooms were recently renovated ( with amazing bathroom ##s ! ) , whereas the rest of the hotel remains fairly old - time ##y ( in a good way ) . Ely at the front desk and Alejandro were phenomena ##l ! Alejandro took a number of the guests on a tour where he showed us secret passage ##ways through the hotel ! He was super knowledge ##able , friendly , and genuine ! The hotel is in a safe area to my knowledge with a small convenience store less than a block away . It is fairly close to the train station , too ! If you like anything historical or nice hotels , stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed only one night to catch a plane out of o ' ha ##re the next day . Great location just a few blocks from the blue line train to / from the airport . Staff very friendly and helpful and nice dinner at hotel restaurant . Room was comfortable and hotel over 100 years old refurbished beautifully . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bed ##ding was superb and what I would expect from Hilton properties . The room was either too cold or too hot . I could not find a happy medium with the the ##rm ##ost ##at . Chip ##s on beverage / snack cart in room were expired ( did not realize until I had eaten several ) , but I was not charged for this . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here for one night on 9 / 22 . We were greeted by Billy who was professional and court ##eous . He said that his sister ' s birthday is the same day as my husband ' s and that he would send up something nice . Little did we know it would be a huge piece of chocolate cake with whipped cream . We had a lovely breakfast the next morning ( included with the room price ) ! Very enjoyable night at the Inter ##nco ##ntin ##ental ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I am in Chicago I always stay at Swiss ##ô ##tel . Last week I stayed there for a conference at McCormick Place . All the services were extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting even though they were at peak . The rooms are always imp ##ec ##ca ##ble and I never have an issue with their w ##i - fi and v ##p ##n when on business . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful large room , great views , incredibly friendly staff . Must mention Carlos at the front desk who provided one of the best check in ' s ! Room was clean , amenities were rich and the mini bar selection was awesome ! Conference space was comfortable , the menu ##s provided were all top notch . Check out the pool and fitness center for a truly unique experience . The hotel was central ##ly located and I would absolutely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is well positioned to many landmarks and easy access to dozens of restaurants . The lobby bar is reasonably good and the second floor restaurant is easy access with moderately good food . Line - ups at Star ##bu ##cks we ’ re pretty long in the mornings during my stay . My room was well appointed with a good view and quiet for sleeping . Some carpet ##s and wooden floors were a bit worn in areas but obviously well cared for . The biggest plus is the staff who are professional and very helpful , as is house keeping . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel and had a great experience . The room was very clean and the staff were extremely helpful . Great place for couples or anyone looking to get away and spend some time in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay at the Talbot ##t was wonderful ! Check in was a breeze even though I arrived early . This hotel is in the Gold Coast , really close to the beach , the miracle mile and 360 Chicago . The room was large with a double sink and j ##ac ##uz ##zi tub . I also really enjoyed their restaurant 20 east ( monkey bread and more for breakfast ) . Another highlight of my stay was the bar and bartender “ D ” who mixed delicious top shelf drinks and was super friendly . 5 star experience ! Would definitely recommend to all . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was traveling alone with my three kids in Chicago . I arrived at the Hilton and everyone was so helpful . The guy holding the door , the lady who checked me in was patient with me with the kids , and one guy in particular , named Do ##y , was super helpful . Not only did he answer my questions about the surrounding area , but he was very polite while selling me a vacation package . Normally people selling vacation packages are annoying , but he was so good , I decided to buy it . Also , I want to add the cookie de ##cor ##ating made my kids travel so much better . Thanks Hilton ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very unique hotel , fantastic staff , great con ##cier ##ge , our room faced t ##rump tower , very low noise , house ##keeping staff excellent , restaurant has a great menu and delicious choices , r ##is ##ott ##o excellent , families would love this hotel . . . rooms have 2 double beds plus a window bed overlooking river , which my children would love . . . so sleep ##s 5 - 6 , dogs welcome . . . . great experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] I checked in on April 9th and I would give a five star rating to Nicole who checked me in at the front desk . She was quick , delight ##ful to talk to and caring . Was there for a convention that occurs every year at the Swiss ##hot ##el . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If staying in this hotel please visit T ##iara at the con ##cier ##ge desk . T ##iara will give you a warm and friendly greeting and At 3 ##pm T ##iara will tell you all about the colour ##ful history of the hotel and of the characters who where patrons or owners as well as sharing some of the hotels secrets , and their are secrets to be shared . . . T ##iara you are a real credit to the hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was clean , comfortable and spacious . Staff was friendly and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . Our air conditioning worked well , which was important as it was very hot weekend during our stay . Water pressure in shower was also great . Due to co ##vid restrictions , breakfast options in lobby were limited but sufficient . Hotel is great location and within close walking distance to many attractions , stores , restaurants , etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always have a great stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago ! ! ! We upgraded to a higher floor for only $ 45 . 00 . You can ##t beat the location . Staff is friendly and always give a late check out when requested . We like the bar area and can ##t wait for the outside patio to get set up for the summer . We will spend hours just sitting outside watching the world go by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Will and Hussein , bell caps are exceptional examples of going above and beyond ! They ’ re your first face you meet for this hotel and they set the bar . Will ’ s can do and heart are beyond words . Thank you for being so kind [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a really a beautiful place ! We stayed and had a wonderful stay , friendly , clean , beds com ##fy , a A + experience , would stay here again and again ! Re ##com ##men ##d this to anyone who wants to stay downtown [SEP]
1	[CLS] Besides the air condition not functioning properly , I would definitely recommend this hotel . Great location , friendly and the con ##cier ##ge was awesome . The hotel restaurant was good , maybe a little over ##p ##rice ##d but that is Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location . Downtown , but on a tree - lined street . Love ##ly . Warm reception from hotel staff . Friendly , helpful , sincere . Small bout ##ique ##y atmosphere delivering high quality service with a smile . We hope to return to The Talbot ##t . [SEP]

1	[CLS] It ’ s a Chicago downtown hotel so if you have a car , local parking is a ##by ##sma ##l and v ##alet is $ 67 a day ! Staff are super ! Friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . No coffee in the room but the bar in the room is full . . minimal ventilation in the bathroom . Light ##ing in the room is subdued . Room was pretty clean and the carpet was nice for a hotel . Water pressure was varied . outlet availability is adequate but not p ##lent ##iful . It ’ s in one of the best neighborhoods in Chicago , so the area is great - safe and friendly . The main complaint I have is in the room I had the walls were paper thin ! I could clearly hear conversations in the room next to mine . . it was so thin , it kinda felt like they were in the same room : ) I would stay here again for a business trip to Chicago , but pass on a family stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a historic hotel and is in the heart of Chicago Downtown and almost walking distance to everything . I spend 2 - days and did the tourist trap sight seeing adventure . The hotel it self is beautiful and feels like an Anti ##que Museum . The room is standard and nothing fancy . I would stay here again if the price is right and overall I enjoyed the stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location as we were in town to see Hamilton for our anniversary . We casually mentioned it and that evening they sent us up a cake and sparkling water . We got a great deal through Hot ##wire - - about 90 a night so I can ' t complain at all . Room was nice - - super com ##fy bed . Only negative is the thin walls . I could hear a lot at night . The prose ##cco hour was nice . Lo ##bby was beautiful and the hotel was right next to the theater that was playing Al ##ad ##din so we were able to wake up early and score 25 dollar rush tickets - - fifth row . Do not park at the hotel . You can find cheaper parking elsewhere . Great stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My sister and I stayed in the 2 Queens suite . It had a nice view and the space was lovely ! The reception was warm and friendly ; however , my sister was not feeling well and needed lots of hot water for hot drinks like tea and Al ##ka Se ##ltz ##er . I went searching the neighborhood for a Star ##bu ##cks , so I could bring back a large cup of hot water . Later , I asked for hot water from room service , which they quickly brought . Imagine my surprise when we were preparing for check - out to discover a hot water pot in one of the cabinets ! It wasn ' t that the staff did anything wrong , but informing guests of their amenities is what I consider the kind of service that should follow luxury accommodation ##s . Other than that , the stay was excellent . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My family has been going to The Talbot ##t Hotel for the last 15 years . Our main reason for staying there is the service and hospitality Given to us by Gene Murray . Gene anti ##ci ##pate ##s our every need and recommend ##s new restaurants he thinks we would enjoy and he always nails it . Now that are kids married they also choose to stay at the Talbot ##t because of Gene . The Talbot ##t Hotel is very fortunate to have Gene working for them for so long ! K ##G [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed in many downtown Chicago hotels - prefer the older historical hotels , so was looking forward to our stay ; A ##rri ##ved in the late afternoon ; check in desk is in a corner with only two desk clerk ##s ; took forever ! Mini ##mal information given ; lobby con ##ges ##ted and long wait for small elevators to get to room ; got to room ; door was un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly loud - needs W ##D ##40 for the squeezing ; carpet uneven . Room clean , but very small ; no information what so ever in the room re : hotel amenities , local sites , etc . When I asked at the desk was told - " there usually is a computer in the room - yours must be being replaced " ; no offer for any assistance . While the location is convenient - there are far better options . Won ' t go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was clean , comfortable , and had a very attractive modern look and feel to it . The beds were super com ##fy and the large bathroom had a luxurious feel to it . The real draw is probably the location though ! It couldn ' t have been better ! I was a little disappointed that I booked 2 rooms weeks in advance and they weren ' t near each other though and when we checked in they told me that there was a $ 100 deposit , per room , per night for incident ##als , even though I ' d paid for the rooms up front . This wouldn ' t have been a big deal except that I wasn ' t told about it in advance . The man at the front desk was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting though and helped to find a deal I was happier with . His customer service is one of the many reasons I would recommend this hotel and will be staying here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean and spacious rooms . We ate breakfast there every morning and the food was great too . The staff was very friendly and helpful with all of our questions . The location was perfect too , walking distance to all of out ##ings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was lovely , staff very re ##sp ##ons ##ive . Leah was fantastic and the most helpful reception at a hotel I have had . Thank you all for your warmth and a lovely stay . Very clean rooms and com ##fy beds ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie . We were able to walk to many restaurants and tourist attractions . The room was clean and comfortable . It was also spacious for a city hotel . It was nice to have the continental breakfast in the morning and especially con ##vie ##nent to have it on every floor . The evening reception was also nice - but the room was crowded and loud the nights that we went ( not much can be done about that ! ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location , staff and room were all perfect ! Easy walk to Michigan Ave , restaurants , and park . The room was always kept clean , the beds were excellent along with the view . Would stay there again when visiting Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] All I can say is I was disappointed . I was looking forward to staying again at the Palmer ’ s . It is such a grand Hotel and for it to be nothing but grand is why I am disappointed . I know it was a busy weekend but the up ##ke ##ep of the rooms should be something that is done and reviewed on a regular basis . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed for a last minute stay . Perfect location , very clean , excellent service and comfortable beds . While our stay was short , we were very pleased with the accommodation ##s . We visit Chicago a lot so will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good hotel with excellent location in the heart of the magnificent mile . Excellent and High ##ly recommended b ##uff ##et breakfast Beautiful & large pool . E ##ff ##icient service , bell boys and v ##alet parking . Two restaurants . Large rooms with all facilities needed . Building from 1929 , decoration sometimes a little bit dated as the only Issue to be improved . The rest is excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Here for the second time for a conference ! As usual , the service was beyond excellent ! I had two reservations ( for overlapping conferences ) so I started out somewhat complicated . Nicole T , who checked me in , was patient and figured it all out . She also recommended a nail salon that was accessible without going out into the cold and walked me part of the way in the right direction ! I also spent time at Am ##use , the lobby bar / lounge to catch up on work . All of the staff there are friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here last month for the Black ##hawks convention . First of all I cannot believe the bad reviews I read prior to our stay . The property is beautiful and clean . We had a comfortable bed and 2 quiet nights sleep . The location is great . Staff was very helpful and friendly . Would love to have the opportunity to visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The beds are comfortable and the location is great for walking to the pier , river walk or lake . A little hard to get too by using GPS . Hotel is being re ##mo ##del ##ed , G ##ym and Pool are under construction at this time [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal for a conference . I attend at least 2 conferences every year and I have to say that the service at this particular hotel was awesome . It was a great location , the room was perfect ( and quiet ) , and the hotel was very clean . Restaurant and Bar service were fantastic as well . I ' d stay here next time I ' m in downtown Chicago for fun . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our kids want to move out of our house and into the suite . Home ##wood Suite ##s has spoiled us . We can ' t stay in a normal room now . And we can ' t book a suite with any other chain because they are too expensive . So you really have no other options , just Home ##wood Suite ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fort ##unate that our company chose the Fair ##mont in Chicago for our 3 day sales kick off . The location was superb , the amenities excellent , the staff exceptional . S ##hout out to the team on the 15th floor , the club room / staff went out of their way to be kind and thoughtful the time we were there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was great . Very clean and modern . A ##wes ##ome bar . I would definitely recommend this hotel for business trips . It ' s central ##ly located so I was in close proximity to the river walk , Chicago architecture center , millennium park , and lots of restaurant options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I recently stayed here for a conference . It ' s price ##y even with a conference rate , but you can ' t beat the location and the lovely view of the river . Our room was spacious ; the bed was comfortable . Several great restaurants are within convenient walking , and who doesn ' t love a Whole Foods just down the street ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is right off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The employees all wore masks and were helpful / professional . Management has taken action to address concerns in recent online reviews . An employee is now posted right inside the entrance to screen en ##tra ##nts + your key card is needed to hail an elevator . All in all we felt very safe and enjoyed our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel but found the bathroom ##s in the room T ##IN ##Y . As a women I need space to put makeup etc but the bathroom ##s were terrible . The rooms were nice But did not have coffee maker s ##c o had to get dressed to go downstairs to get coffee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The old world charm of Palmer drive , its central location and Hilton ##s tested customer service made this stay a perfect win ! The building is showing some age in the rooms side , but the lively lobby and the great restaurant and breakfast ( free for diamond members ) is an amazing deal in Chicago city . A ##bs ##ol ##ute value for money ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Outstanding hotel , splendid location , excellent staff and comfortable rooms . The P ##ump Room is a wonderful place for drinks and food and has an outstanding atmosphere . Great value for the price and good for either business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The mattress is horrible and should be upgraded . Me and my girlfriend woke up in pain both mornings . The hotel itself is on a great area that can ' t be beat . The room is spacious and luxurious . We ate in the restaurant and the food was good . Great hotel if they upgrade the beds . [SEP]
0	[CLS] After a long trip to Chicago we checked in via a very un ##we ##l ##coming young lady . She seemed more intent on making us feel un ##we ##l ##come . We went up to our room and it was old school classic , very ornate . The place was lovely to look at , but when the staff don ##t smile you wonder if you should even be there . We stayed at a Hilton a few days elsewhere and it was so much better [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a weekend in Chicago and booked a hotel with restaurant and bar for convenience . Bar was closed , restaurant offered 2 fast food style breakfast options and nothing more . Ice had to be requested since there were no ice machines available . No convenient restaurant nearby . Vale ##t parking was not available . If you go , you are on your own ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived and were told we couldn ' t keep our luggage at the hotel ( for the next 6 hours ) due to co ##vid . We didn ##t receive any info in advance about that . Finally , they found a room for us to keep our bags and for us to stay that haven ' t been used in over a year . There was major mild ##ew in the bathroom ( we took pictures ) . The room was old and worn and the windows needed to be cleaned and the bottom ##s of the windows had debris . It was $ 340 to stay there - a lot of money and the hotel was old , dirty and difficult . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked the hotel with the hope it was clean and near the red line to go to W ##rig ##ley Field . The hotel did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint as the rooms were nice with some views . We found a deal with the b ##uff ##et breakfast included and loved the food and service . The red line was a 10 - minute walk from the hotel and other area attractions ( Navy Pier , the bean , shopping / restaurants on the Miracle Mile ) were anywhere from a 5 - minute to a 20 - minute walk . There were areas inside the hotel to gather with friends or family to sit and visit or play games . We enjoyed our visit and plan to stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The experience was par . I ' ve had the same service quality for far less money . Nothing was bad but also not exceptional . Room had a great view and the location was convenient . Would not stay again with large party . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The customer service is awesome ! Jane and D ##wayne was so lovely and nice . I honestly would just come back to stay because of the services here . The room was lovely , we were upgraded , unfortunately our room was right out where the construction was , it didn ' t bother us as we weren ' t in the room around the time they start and we had our curtains closed . Show ##er was ST ##RO ##NG W ##H ##IC ##H I L ##O ##VE ##D . Again , I will definitely stay again because of people like Jane and D ##wayne ! Keep it up ! I will definitely come back again in Nov ! Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] beautiful hotel for a family gathering . had family reunion in June 2018 and all went well . there was some issue with water flow in a couple of rooms but was addressed and corrected . staff was very helpful & friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were travelling with an auto v . coming into the city via train . The breakfast / parking package was valuable and helpful so we could enjoy the Gold Coast and Chicago ' s offerings . Clean and bright ; a bit too modern for us and wall - hanging ##s left us longing for a spot of color ( a pink rose in a vase would go far ! ) A great location and staff were friendly . Be careful in the elevator and your room closet - - they spray a toxic " f ##rag ##rance , " Feb ##ree ##ze - type scent in elevators and in - room closet . P ##lug your nose or hold your breath . Room ##s are good unless you open up the closet . But other than that , we enjoyed the hotel and would book again ( having mentioned the above to the management in hopes to have the issue re ##ct ##ified . ) Try it . It ' s ch ##ic and cool ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Did not meet the usual Fair ##mont standard . Book ##ed room category was not available due to “ un ##sche ##du ##led maintenance ” so was knocked down a level from what was booked . They compensate ##d but I would prefer to just get what I booked . One morning had a wake up call scheduled , woke up early so called down and cancelled the call but later on the wake up call came anyway ##s but was 15 min late from what it was originally supposed to be . Upon check ##out had a mini bar charge that wasn ’ t correct so had to have front desk reverse it . Property is nice and staff were good but expect more from a Fair ##mont . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall hotel was great , they really need to re ##or ##gan ##ize their check in proceed ##ures . as of may 2018 they are terrible . rooms were excellent , breakfast was great , need a few more item choices like bacon and sa ##usage and not just one just to give an example . People were very friendly . the elevators were out of commission part of the stay so we only had one available ( that was no fun ) but overall a fantastic place to stay . Any thing I had a concern about ( which wasn ' t much ) was handled immediately . They took care of the check in fi ##asco with no hit ##ches so cu ##do ' s to the staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suites are large and have lots of amenities . The staff are all really friendly and helpful . Having breakfast and " happy hour " are great especially with children , you don ' t all have to get up early and find somewhere to eat . The location is great . Also the pool and fitness center are great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel ' s location . We had exceptionally nice weather for December in Chicago . we walked everywhere , Millennium Park , Maggie Dale ##y Park , the River ##walk , State street and the Kris Kind ##le Mart . Hotel staff ##ers , Ra ##fi , Andrew , Martin , Jason , Spencer , Ricardo , Steve and Henry went above and beyond to make sure that we were taken care of . Hotel was exceptionally clean and beautifully decorated for the holidays . Great shower and I loved the H ##2 ##O bath products . Nice view from our suite . We will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service team was at ##ten ##tive and welcoming . I would totally stay again . Room was spacious and clean . Hotel is close to Miracle Mile and all the great shops and restaurants . N ##ei ##gh ##bor ##hood is clean and safe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came to attend a business event but the Hotel experience was beyond expectations . Great rooms , commodities , bath and Bed ##s are awesome , be careful , you won ’ t want to wake up once you are on them . Great ! I will come back for sure [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was there for a week on business . Suite ##s were recently re ##mo ##del ##ed and have everything you can ask for . Staff were excellent and did their best to make my stay enjoyable . Aside from the usual compliment ##ary breakfast , the 5 - 7 was a nice touch and not something you see everyday . Close to Ma ##g Mile and a host of fantastic restaurants - the Eat ##ily is just around the corner . Would come back again if in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed overnight for family wedding . Room was decent , clean and good price for the city . Wedding was in their ballroom . The waits ##ta ##ff was very good . Bar service was ok The rest of hotel staff was terrible . Worst service i have ever had from front desk , bell ##hop , even the phone operator ! I actually wrote a complaint ( first time ever for a hotel ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed for almost three weeks at the Intercontinental Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile in October . I was taken care of from the moment I ' ve stepped in . Billy Burr ##age , one of the Guest Relations Super ##visor ##s , made sure to provide me with a personal ##ized reception and a great comfortable room . On my departure date , he was also present to greet me and wish a safe trip . Overall a great hotel with personal ##ized service ! Will definitely book my next stay in Chicago at the same venue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] room was nice , good view close to restaurants . . . . right in downtown Chicago . . . . Clean room nice shower that was huge . . . . . comfortable bed , b ##ose radio ##over ##all nice experience , received a v ##ou ##cher for a free drink in Le Bar [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at Home ##wood Suite ##s Chicago was one of the best hotel stays I ' ve ever had . From up ##grading our room to the nice breakfast each morning , it was one to remember . This hotel is also located in a perfect part of town , so close to the magnificent mile . Just about everything you would want to visit while in Chicago is within a mile . The view from our 18th floor 1 ##BR king room was AM ##A ##Z ##ING . The staff was all very nice as well . There is a managers reception mom - th ##urs , and we enjoyed free wine , soup and salad . Will stay here for sure if ever in Chicago again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I waited very patiently while The Talbot ##t Hotel was under renovation , what a wonderful experience . This bout ##ique hotel was everything I had hoped and more . The staff and AL ##L of the employees were very welcoming ; they personally accommodate ##d all of our needs . It was a pleasant surprise to walk into such a spacious and bright room . There were very unique touches to the room , including perfectly proportion ##ed furniture . I will return again and again [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is in an amazing location in the middle of the city which makes walking around a breeze . They hotel identifies itself as a luxury hotel , but I think that ' s pushing it a bit . Don ' t get me wrong though , it is a very nice hotel with friendly staff . The beds are very comfortable and the rooms clean . I was left wanting for a bath ##tub as only some of the upgraded rooms come with a tub . Din ##ing for breakfast at their restaurant on the 20th floor was very nice with good food and friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My review of this f ##abulous hotel is under one of the pictures I was very lengthy it is a wonderful experience at the O ##m ##ni . I have so much to say about this gorgeous hotel the incredible staff especially Le ##i in House ##keeping and Josh D and Laurence who are both outstanding experts at guest relations at your front desk . The O ##m ##ni Ma ##g Mile was a great experience and we had a perfect stay everyone on your staff seems to be ex ##em ##p ##lary . Can ’ t wait to visit again . . . . thank you all so much Perfect ##ion ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Updated modern feel . Very clean . Beautiful view from the fitness center on the 43 ##rd floor facing Navy Pier . Would definitely stay here again ! The service was great , love the pool table in the lobby bar area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt was a wonderful , their food is excellent , the hotel staff is very friendly and court ##eous . I do feel where we stored our luggage before we left could have been a bigger room and closer to our venue site , but there were several things going on besides our conference . Thanks for a great Summit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had never been to this hotel , but I had heard good things from my company ’ s in - house travel agent . . . The hotel has a neat Art Dec ##o theme , a throw ##back to an earlier renovation during the 1930 ’ s . . . The rooms are on the smaller side , but they are nicely appointed and the beds are very comfortable . . . The 312 restaurant ( Italian ) located within the hotel has excellent food ; you won ’ t be disappointed . The staff is very friendly and helpful ! I recommend it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quiet , awesome rooms , everything is brand new . The staff was friendly and professional , chat ##ted with my 3 y ##r old about going to see dinosaurs at the museum . We couldn ' t have asked for a better room or location along Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful views of the river and easy walking distance to everything I wanted to visit . Ride sharing apps had trouble finding where to pick me up but everything was resolved eventually . Staff was extremely helpful and was always greeted whenever I entered the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One bedroom suite was Modern updated and very spacious for three adults the kitchen living room area provided relax for area for all while the bedroom had some privacy for one bathroom with huge views from the 12 floor room or excellent morning and night noon check out was a bonus allowing us to come back to the room and relax before checking out will stay there again [SEP]
1	[CLS] What was a great place to eat a Sunday B ##runch now is terrible . I mean just awful . Go to Te ##mpo Restaurant down the block . Sorry to say these words but this is how I feel Maybe they weren ’ t making money on the old menu but now they will be getting only hotel quest there now [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amy is J ##US ##T THE B ##ES ##T ! Help ##ful , clear , patient and generous spirit ##ed . Thanks Amy . All staff were helpful and plea ##sa ##my . The hotel ’ s food was very good and I must say a bit of a surprise . Maid service was good . Front desk was helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The history of the hotel is amazing and very interesting . To know that so much of what you see is from the original hotel built in the late 1800 ' s . The staff always pleasant and willing to go the extra mile to assist . And then the 5 : 00 - 6 : 00 Happy Hour in the lobby is fun and something to look forward to . Only draw ##back was no in - room dining but there are many restaurants within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked our hotel on Travel ##zo ##o and got a great rate . Love ##d the bathroom with both a shower and a bath ##tub . The hotel , is located near an L stop . Note the v ##alet parking is $ 71 per night . However , there are less expensive garage ##s nearby . Also , the hotel charges an $ 8 resort fee per night which covers W ##IF ##I , compliment ##ary coffee and c ##rois ##san ##ts from 5 - 7 am . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We moved from the Embassy Suite ##s over to the Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco and had the best experience . Our room had a spectacular view of the river and the hospitality was outstanding . Although you can hear the city , as you are in the midst of it , we slept so well . The curtains allow for a very dark room when you want it . The beds were quite comfortable . And , the views were outstanding . The location of the Hotel Monaco is so convenient . We easily walked to Mill ##eni ##um Park , the Art Institute , the Theatre ( to see Hamilton ) and to Navy Pier . We appreciated the wine and coffee and enjoyed eating at Fi ##sk and Co . This was a wonderful trip for us and we loved the hotel . We will absolutely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed it since the first minute that we arrived , very nice service , the room was modern and big size . It ##´s location is perfect , very close to The Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile , restaurants and bars . My husband liked the coins that give you in order to have drinks at their lounge . We really recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Head ##ed to the city from the near western suburbs for 24 hours of shopping dining and fun with a girlfriend . Every wish was met and we were able to walk easily to all ! Room was sq ##ue ##ak ##y clean and com ##fy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent and full ##ness experience . The architecture , the street design , the people , the complete offer of food and entertainment , the urban environment provide to the travelers a ma ##rve ##lous opportunity to enjoy the best of USA . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago . Staff is always so kind and helpful . Check in process is stream ##lined and simple ( Hilton Honors ) . Lock ##wood is a wonderful option for any meal , as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent visit with family in Chicago . Love the H ##ya ##tt on the River . Every detail and view is exquisite . We enjoy the warmth of the hostess in Big Bar and the friendly smiles at the restaurant in the morning bringing the hot coffee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What can I say ? Central , clean , friendly . All you need while in Chicago . You can choose to din ##e in the hotel restaurant or choose from a screen in your room to have local eat ##eries deliver to the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##ce ##ede ##d expectations ! D ##wayne was fantastic . Great location . Very nice looking hotel - the lobby is very ch ##ic . The restaurant is very good , with a super nice breakfast . One elevator ( of 2 ) was being repaired , so we got out exercise using the stairs ( not a big deal ) . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the pleasure of staying at the Ambassador this past week . It was a last minute booking because of a leak in my a ##pt but Travis made my stay sea ##m ##less . They gave me a great room and even offered me a drink when I checked in to take the edge off my stress ##ful day ! The food , staff and am ##bian ##ce at the hotel restaurant were amazing . I will be suggesting this hotel for friends who come to visit me in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted this hotel with family , friendly staff , nice rooms , food was ok . . . overall this place was OK , not W ##OW but OK . price was ok for the location compared to other options around the area . I will recommend this hotel to friend and family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good customer experience . The conference was very organized and the H ##ya ##tt staff were outstanding with the service we received from them . All of our meals were very good . I would recommend the H ##ya ##tt to my co - workers . Thanks for the pleasant stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] With an exceptionally gorgeous ##ly ornamental lobby , one anti ##ci ##pate ##s the room to shine with all the creature comfort ##s of a luxury hotel . Unfortunately , here is where the disappointment begins . The furniture hints at antique charm , yet , upon closer inspection you ' ll find chips , den ##ts , and scratch ##es . The wall ##paper has yellow ##ed and began to lift . The typical refrigerator that you ' d expect has been replaced for a mini fridge of cheap , over ##p ##rice ##d liquor ready to charge you whenever you look its direction . If you want actual comfort , you can find it nearby for less . It won ' t come with the name or the classic de ##cor , however , I assure you , you won ' t care . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a standard room with a king bed . Everything was very clean and turn down service did a great job each day to clean everything up . The bathroom had also been re - done and was very nice with a rain shower head and bright van ##ity area . The location was also perfect , right across the Drake for a way better price . Just up from Water ##tower Place and just off Michigan Ave . Would recommend to anyone coming to stay in Chicago for any trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So its a decent place , great location and all , but definitely not a four star hotel . I stay in hotels very frequently and I will say that room wise , this is a 3 star at best . The rooms aren ' t great , bathroom ##s are okay - no ventilation in my bathroom , or even lock on the door . A few of the amenities , comfort and additions of your typical 4 + star hotels are not present here . In short , its a decent place , but if you ' re going for the comfort of a 4 star , this is not the place to go to [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 4 nights and loved it . Room service was excellent and breakfast was superb ! They even have bikes you can use to ride around the city . Good views of mill ##ennial park and a great location . Sad thing is I left my belt there : ( [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Palmer House in Chicago . It is an iconic hotel . It has a beautiful lobby . The rooms are okay . The walls are thin , so bring ear plug ##s . It is clean and the staff are nice . I just wished they had a coffee / tea machine in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hotel was fantastic . The staff was great , location was perfect . Robert at the Front desk checked us in and give us a room with lake view which was amazing , we enjoyed the fireworks from the room ! ! Thank you Robert for making this weekend special . We definitely will go back to Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sad that such a character property has deteriorated . Hotel management has not been honest with prospective guests , by advising only one elevator operational for 16 floors and that same guest elevator is shared by hotel house ##keeping staff . No Coffee in room , only one broken down chair in room . . . H ##ya ##tt you should be hum ##iliated to put your brand on this property [SEP]
0	[CLS] When I walked in the hotel I got excited by how nice the hotel looked . I checked in with Nicole . She did a great job and helped me feel like I was a special guest . I asked a lot of questions and she was able to answer them without making me feel like annoyed her . Sometimes I just talk a lot . Anyway , the experience she gave me made me feel very comfortable . I think my stay will be great . I will let you know if it changes . Great views and location . Thank you Nicole . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel was really nice . Right near millennium park and the museums , but also not far from the magnificent mile . The hotel ' s de ##cor is really nice in a de ##co style . The room was large and the bed was giant as well as the whole place very clean . They also have different events for guests such as a hot chocolate bar and a wine event at night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel worked well for us , a family with two 8 year old girls , grandparents and the Mom & Dad . Very nice rooms . An indoor pool , we used twice . We walked to several near by good restaurants . If you are looking to be in the heart of Chicago this is a good choice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recommended this to friends who were travelling with us based on booking . com price . The hotel pu ##rp ##orted to add “ amenities charge ” presented initially as akin to taxes . We had been given an inclusive price . They argued we were mistaken until I located a link to our confirmation from booking . com . They also charged with particular ##s for mini bar even though stock checks would have shown electronic record was wrong . Not encountered in other So ##fit ##el . After initial customer satisfaction inquiry management have provided one vague justification only . Trust is important with your hotels bill ##ing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was better than expected . Multiple food options , easy access to public transportation . I used the market on the lobby level , and I also ate at the restaurant in the main lobby . Both experiences were fantastic . In walking distance to the Ma ##g Mile , and Mill ##eni ##um Park . I will stay again very soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room has no slip ##per , no tooth ##brush , no refrigerator and just one small bottle ##d water . I understand that it is common for hotels in US , but it took so long for the staff to deliver my requested items . Sometimes , they just ignored my call . . . . The building is old ( don ' t know if this is a common thing for She ##rato ##n but all She ##rato ##ns I have been to are old . . . . ) and it is a bit smell ##y in the hallway . The only good thing about this hotel is its location , near to the river , Mill ##eni ##um park , etc . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Me and my partner came here for a stay ##cation and the hotel was awesome . Happy Hour ! Super clean ! And the customer service was great ! I ended up leaving my the ##rm ##os and was notified the very same day . I came to pick it up after work a few days later and it was after pick up hours . Jim ##el was super a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and tried to see if it was possible to get it . Kathy was on her way out the door at that exact moment and even though her shift seemed to be over she turned right around and went and got my the ##rm ##os . It was Al ##bee ’ s one to see how much they care about the guest . Would definitely recommend this place to others ! Great staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fy beds . Room ##s are small but typical for downtown . Nice ##ly located to everything . Friendly staff . Would stay here again . Room ##s have stock ##ed mini ##f ##ridge as well as k ##eur ##ig . Free w ##if ##i . Park ##ing is across the street at $ 42 per night . Lo ##bby isn ' t anything spectacular . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It has a great location . Room ##s were clean . 24 / 7 convenience store . I would come again . Great room view . Room ##s are spacious . Has a bar in the lobby . Front desk service was very friendly . Check ##out time is at 12 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hilton is at a very convenient location , walking distance to a bunch of nice restaurants , the Mi ##lie ##nn ##ium Park and the Art Institute . We watched the Hamilton show and we could also walk back to our hotel which was super convenient . We were upgraded to a room with two queen beds with two bathroom ##s . Room was spacious and comfortable although the bed is a bit soft for me . Staff were really f ##re ##ind ##ly and helpful . The pool is actually a good size for a hotel in the heart of the city and the gym has lots of machines . Overall , very impressed with the premise . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Melissa , the con ##cier ##ge , went out of her way to assist me with a restaurant choice and dinner reservation . The service provided by the registration staff was excellent . Hotel is in a great downtown Chicago location . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions are ups ##cale . Love staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fr ##ist time at the Ki ##nz ##ie . Beautiful bout ##ique hotel , small hands on efficient staff , They sent me a text message to contact them if I had any questions while we were out and about . I texted them 2 times ( L location and best Pizza in the area ) , and they got back to me within 2 minutes . We had a corner suite on the 3rd floor , all glass , fantastic views . The only thing I would say , is if you can get a higher floor , do . Little too much street noise on the 3rd floor . Fantastic location . Right across the street from Harry Carr ##y ' s ( best food ! ! ) , right in the middle of the downtown area . The only thing missing was a rooftop bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was clean . Staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . D ##wayne was very helpful with everything we needed . Check ##ed out but no problem with holding our bags while we went out for the afternoon before we left . Nice location . Will be staying here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] As the title suggests , many attractions , restaurants , iconic buildings , parks , the river , within walking distance ( approx . 1 mi ) . The hotel is nice , the rooms are spacious and modern , I would stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a great location . The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean . The service from the reception staff was polite , but minimal . No info about the hotel was given at check in , no asking if everything was ok as we checked out . The tea and coffee was not re ##ple ##nish ##ed each day , neither were the bathroom products . It was a good base for us to explore the city , but we were not bowled over by it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was happy staying there with friends for my birthday . The room was nice and the room service was quick . I will stay here again . The best part was the bar and the surrounding bakery connected to the mall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very nice long weekend recently and stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . We had a corner room with windows on two walls . The room was very well appointed with a King size bed . The rooms are nicely updated , however the sliding door for the bath does not offer much privacy from noise . The shower and other bath amenities are very nice . My only complaints are the noise of the AC fan and the toilet was loose on the wall . No worries about falling off , but it c ##reaked each time it was used . The personnel were very helpful . The bar staff were very friendly . Craig ( Bell Stand ) was very helpful with our bags and knowledge ##able about travel time to the airport . Nice stay overall . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great hotel ! The de ##cor is clean , minimal and elegant . As an interior designer , it ' s hard to find a hotel that doesn ' t off ##end me aesthetic ##ally . No crazy graphic wall ##paper , no ugly hotel carpet and no old fashion , dark heavy furniture or over the top d ##rap ##es ! Friendly service and perfect downtown location ! The bed ##ding is soft and the room smells fresh ! I personally like that there is a separate tub from the shower and the lighting is low . I can also adjust the temperature in my room which I like . My room also happens to have a view of Lake Michigan and Grant Park ! Pretty ideal ! ! I ' m taking a stay ##cation in my own City for Lo ##lla ##pal ##oo ##za and this hotel was perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had reserved a room on the executive level , but we were upgraded to a suite on check in . Our rooms were on the 20th floor and had a sink , dining / meeting room , two bathroom ##s . We did have access to the executive lounge and had breakfast and dinner there . The las ##ag ##na dinner was very good . The breakfast ##s were just ok . I was disappointed that there wasn ' t any meat , but they had eggs , pan ##cakes , m ##uff ##ins , fruit etc . The location was great and you are within walking distance from many entertainment areas and restaurants . There are also train and bus stops nearby if you need to go further out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for all star weekend and the hotel was amazing . . . room service was price ##y but it was well worth it . It was also v ##ale ##ntin ##e ’ s weekend so we had dinner in Michael Jordan ##s restaurant and everything was delicious . Room was very clean and spacious . The location was even better if you like to shop . Everything is walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel and design , great people working at the reception , David ( Con ##cier ##ge ) was as good as it gets . Our room ( 60 ##1 ) whatsoever had no daylight due to a funny building that is right outside the window . The room itself was nice , so it did have a very small bathroom . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Fair ##mont Chicago because I was attending a conference there . The hotel was very nice and I enjoyed walking to the Navy Pier area one evening . I also enjoyed the beautiful view of the ma ##rina from my room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is just a step from the station of Red line ( Grand station ) , so very convenient for me to get there from the airport ( Blue line , transit to Red line at Lake or Jackson station ) . There are many restaurants nearby , so very easy to feed my stomach , e . g . , pizza UN ##O , just at the corn ##or . Just two blocks to the The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ( Michigan Ave ) , many s ##hp ##ping center there . For most of the view spots , it is easy to take the Red line or walk to . In a word , very happy . The price is reasonable in downtown Chicago , 220 $ per day . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast and evening social are all very satisfied . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights for an in - hotel seminar . Great place for groups of 10 to 75 . Staff , food , location , meeting facilities were excellent . Location is perhaps the best I ' ve had for inner Chicago ##land - right off the River ##walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel - very convenient ##ly located in a central location , with friendly staff and good rooms . The highlight is the b ##urger in the bar though . It ’ s quite an original presentation and very ta ##sty . The gym is also much improved . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel and cannot wait to go back . From the minute you walk in and notice the f ##rag ##rance in the air ! Staff are so nice and persona ##ble . I ate in the restaurant bar twice . Del ##icious and French bartender so nice . The room was spacious , beautiful , spot ##less ! You will not be disappointed when you stay here . [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is located amazing ##ly in the middle of The Loop area . One can easily walk to visit any sights in the area . Lo ##bby and bar area have a very impressive art - de ##co design and seem to have been recently renovated . The rooms , unfortunately , are a bit out ##dated and small - the style isn ' t really in the line with that of the rest of the hotel . Staff was very friendly and helpful . Porter ##s , however , were not very helpful with luggage and ordering a taxi . Didn ' t have the chance to check - out the restaurant , but it seemed busy at all times . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent a few nights at the All ##egro for a work trip . The lobby is attractive and they have a free happy hour ( awesome ) where they served only prose ##cco ( b ##oo ##oo ##o ) . The meeting rooms were either too warm or completely f ##rig ##id . My room was tiny and shared a door with another room . Which meant I could hear a lot from that room . And the hall . And the construction . Free ear ##p ##lug ##s were provided which was nice because they were necessary . The halls and room just felt like they are aging . It didn ##t smell fresh or clean in the hallway . And don ' t get me started on the elevators . Almost a 10 minute wait one morning but I just didn ' t want to walk down 15 stories . The location is good but that ' s the most I can say for this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] With the view of the water , with the feeling that you are welcome by everyone , when you even add the Club level of this be ##uti ##ful hotel , you can only regret that your time spent there is over . The rooms are extremely clean , the atmosphere is extremely pleasant and the location is amazing . Walking to the water , walking to the best shops and great restaurants . It is a " must stay " in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had 2 rooms in the Grand Tower . The hotel is efficient , clean , perfectly located , and our rate was great . Kathy the con ##cier ##ge was truly a pro and we were so grateful for her help lining up restaurants and tours for us ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have been eating at this hotel ' s restaurant for years and staying in other locations . We decided to stay there over Christmas as we were not disappointed . The bed ##ding is amazing and i know that it sounds silly but we did not want to leave the hotel . In fact , we did not for most of one day ! How ' s that for a recommendation . There are a couple great places to stay in this neighborhood but this hotel I ' d put at the top of my list . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at Palmer House close to Christmas . It was a wonderful experience . The very magnificent lobby was further enhanced by a huge , beautifully decorated Christmas tree . The atmosphere in the lobby was c ##ele ##bra ##tory with families and couples enjoying drinks and re ##f ##resh ##ments . They accept dogs , so our little s ##ch ##na ##uze ##r was welcome as part of the family . We had dinner in their restaurant , Lock ##woods , which was not cheap , but convenient . The room was not spectacular , but comfortable and the halls had portraits of all the entertain ##ers who had pre ##formed there over the years . The hotel is within walking distance of many sights and the park . While the stay was not cheap , it was a lovely experience and very memorable [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fr ##e ##quent travel ##er to Chicago for business and pleasure . So ##fit ##el never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . Excellent place for business travel as location is close to everything , including Chicago Loop business , which is a short U ##ber / L ##y ##ft or 20 min walk . Restaurant and bar area are ch ##ic and staff outstanding throughout this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this chain . The points are great and the staff and management are so wonderful to deal with . The Intercontinental Ma ##g ##M ##ile is no different . Check in and the Con ##cier ##ge were great , just like every other ones in the chain . H ##OW ##E ##VE ##R , the physical plant in Chicago is a little dated . During this recent visit , I stayed in a suite in the Grand Tower that was notable for its two bathroom ##s . That alone has me really thinking that this hotel may be my go - to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed with O ##m ##ni in Chicago 1 night . Very nice unique room . The fitness center is pro quality and the staff were great . The hotel is located right in the heart of the Ma ##g Mile ( North Michigan a ##ve ) and you can walk to just about everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It has been a while since staying at this property . Found it to be better than our last visit . Hotel is up - to - date the room is up - to - date and We enjoyed the no ##stal ##gia of the hotel . Check in was a little difficult but check out was a breeze . Nice location to restaurants and shopping . The breakfast is Beyond our expectations . Getting in Too ##k a few minutes but it went quickly and the staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed here for a work trip and I was very impressed with the hotel and it ' s clean , friendly atmosphere . Robert Jones stood out and was really helpful . He is a real asset to the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel and I saw him go the extra mile for all the guests at the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Swiss ##ote ##l exceeded all of my expectations ! The staff kindly assisted me with questions and na ##vi ##gating through the hotel . I especially want to extend my gratitude to Nicole at the Guest Services desk . Her professional ##ism and kindness added to my wonderful stay ! She has a great sense of humor and I enjoyed chatting with her during check in . She happily answered any questions I had pertaining to the hotel . My room was extremely clean and I had a gorgeous view of Lake Michigan . I will definitely stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l in the future , and recommend this hotel to my friends and family without hesitation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] # 1 : I was abruptly told upon check - in the despite my Gold status that breakfast wasn ' t compliment ##ary . I was di ##ssa ##tisfied with this news . I stay at Hilton property approximately 25 nights per year and I have never encountered this . situation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed in for a work conference and had to call the front desk multiple times for w ##if ##i . Opera ##tor on the phone was rude . Con ##sist ##ent w ##if ##i is a basic requirement nowadays so I doubt I ' ll be staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We frequently fly into Chicago for trips . I have stayed in multiple hotels all across downtown and West Loop . This hotel by far has been the best in clean ##liness , hospitality and amazing views . They even have a green e ##co friendly house cleaning where you can receive $ 10 day credit . It is the perfect location by the downtown river and navy pier . Sharif ##a , at the front desk went above and beyond finding me a tooth ##brush when I arrived , saving me a snow ##y trip out to C ##VS . We will definitely come back and stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was situated within walking distance of many great food options . The service provided at check in was pro ##mpt and pain ##less especially after a missed flight . Inside the rooms , the de ##cor was modern and clean . Could not really fault it for a 4 star hotel . Would definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time here and it was a great place to stay . it was close to everything and the room was nice . Room was not too small and beautifully designed . I would stay here again . The staff were really friendly also : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] An example of a poorly - thought - out mix of old & updated is in the bar / lounge area : You sit down and are handed enormous , hard - to - hold i ##Pad - type tablets , with displays and videos of drinks & snack ##s - but you can ' t order from the tablet ! A waiter has to be flag ##ged down , just like the " old days ! Similar situation at breakfast . Very small rooms , lacking period / historical detail : Updated with cheap , " new " & generic mid - range hotel look . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad , which is only 2 years old , has well thought - out and rather high - tech rooms . They are gorgeous and spacious with good city views . The lobby is on the 21st floor and the rooms are below it . There is v ##alet parking . Of all the hotels I ' ve been in around the world - - - this was my favorite . The room was so much fun that shopping became secondary . The staff couldn ' t have been better . This is a hotel with staff that truly understands service . Thank you , Conrad ! The only disappointment was the roof - top bar . Go up and look around , but don ' t go hungry because you might not get waited on . If it rains , the bar is closed . I ' m not sure about pricing . It seems to me like a luxury hotel at a mid - range price for Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel Monaco is a true g ##em in the heart of the city ! Great location , great restaurant , and close to everything ! ! ! The rooms are very well decorated and comfortable , as well . To top it off , the staff is fantastic ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent a nice 4 day weekend at the Chicago O ##m ##ni and could not have liked it more . The rooms were very clean and spacious . The bed was fantastic and the service exceptional . I asked if the room had a mini - fried and they said no but we could bring up a fridge for you and then they brought a large mini fridge that was perfect for our needs . It was my birthday and because I had signed up for the select guest program they provide special treats in our room . House ##keeping was efficient and took care of every request . Great location too as it is close to all the shopping and Water Tower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are clean but not good service . The room service while very very expensive , took 45 m ##ns , came missing an item , the seasonal vegetable dish was swimming in bacon without warning in the menu . The staff not very friendly but not rude . I liked the fresh smell of the sheets . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an ornate art - de ##co hotel red ##one in grand style , with a most at ##ten ##tive staff , and yes , almost the feeling of a time war ##p as you enter from the noisy streets . Think bronze elevator doors , carved wood , and 1920s photos all around . Photo ##s do not do justice to the 2 lo ##bb ##ies , lovely marble fireplace and many peaceful no ##ok separated by smoked glass . The W ##al ##nut Room is breath ##taking ! Guest Room ##s are beautifully appointed , elevator is fast , and the sound ##proof ##ing is te ##rri ##fic , as the noisy trains and traffic are just outside . We loved our stay here , and we will be back ! Park using Spot ##her ##o in the Lake / Wells lot just around the corner . Jo ##in Ka ##rma for free w ##if ##i . I will definitely be back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ambassador this weekend with 5 girlfriend ##s to celebrate birthday ##s . The hotel is a lovely retreat from busy Chicago and the service was warm and friendly . Hotel has been recently re ##mo ##del ##ed and the atmosphere is co ##zy urban . Breakfast and drinks in either the Library or bar are te ##rri ##fic . But the best part of our visit was the service we received from Custom ##er Service manager Travis Howard . We communicated before the trip and he worked hard to find perfect restaurants that fit exactly with how we wanted to celebrate and eat . And to find spots for 6 on a busy week in Chicago was no easy feat . He is our new best friend ! We had champagne and cup ##cakes at our arrival and our wishes were definitely his command ! We will never stay any place else ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Outstanding value , amenities , staff , at ##ten ##tive ##ness , and more ! Perfect location , easy to get around , and smiles at every turn . The 67 ##6 bar is a great spot to get a cocktail or glass of wine while you watch the city wind down its day , and the fitness center is very nicely appointed with plenty of options and extra ##s ! And you ' re steps away from the massive Star ##bu ##cks jewel just south of the O ##m ##ni ( if that ' s your thing - it ' s certainly mine ! ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I , along with family , were in Chicago to celebrate my birthday and we stayed overnight at the Ki ##nz ##ie . We can ' t say enough about the comfortable accommodation ##s and friend ##liness of the staff . The Guest Services Manager , Melissa Dr ##iza , left a lovely note and chocolate ##s in our room upon arrival . It was a nice touch and started off my birthday celebration as soon as I entered the room . We enjoyed our stay and will definitely book our next stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Got a very good price and was slightly worried about what shape the hotel might be in , but it was great . Easy to walk to where we wanted to go . Was afraid the room was going to be super cramped ; it was a little on the smaller side , but had plenty of room to move around . Thought there was a bit of a smell , but my wife never mentioned it so thought maybe it was just me , and it wasn ' t terrible . Was very happy with our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was amazing , windows gal ##ore , easy check in and the best bed ever . Could not get over the views of the lake & river . Love this hotel , great location and perfect bar . We walked to everything . The staff was friendly & so know ##led ##gable [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very nice hotel with exceptional staff and perfect location . Very clean and inviting . The rooms were a bit small but for the price it was well worth the stay . Michael Jordan ’ s bar was a great atmosphere to have a couple cocktail ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is convenient ##ly located a block from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and within easy walking distance to the Navy Pier , Mill ##ennial Park and the Art Institute of Chicago . The rooms are spacious and clean . There are markets , shops and restaurants all around the hotel , making this an excellent location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We never thought the marathon weekend would be such a great time to visit the city with young kids but we were wrong . The hotel is not only perfectly located but the staff are incredible , friendly and could not do enough to make our stay perfect . The hotel was booked solid but this did not affect service quality or our experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I arrived at 7 : 00 PM and wanted to eat and go to sleep . I ordered the “ steak f ##rites ” and beer . As you can see , the description is misleading - there was no “ red wine sauce ” , vegetables or t ##ruff ##le anything on the f ##ries . Tri ##ste ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a wedding . Good location as many restaurants in walking distance . Room ##s have modern de ##cor but lack sufficient working plug ##s and lighting is poorly designed . El ##eva ##tors are slow and there are no internal stairs for access to meeting rooms from first to second floor . Room was clean and bed was comfortable . Help ##ful staff to get bags up to room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A perfect place to stay - outside the Loop but easy to get to and from . Great food and shopping nearby . Service is first rate and rooms are clean and bright and very quiet . A great place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There was a lot to like about this property but probably not enough to want to stay here again . Here are the positive ##s : nice lobby , competent staff , free spark ##ing wine / happy hours , clean room . Here are the negative ##s : property feels dark , de ##cor is heavy and dated , despite a recent re ##f ##resh . Can ##not dial 0 for an operator and requests for services ( e . g . towels ) go through the front desk which can be overwhelmed . This is a fine business hotel but I might choose something a bit brighter and simpler next time I ' m in town . That said , it was a good value for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Re ##ception experience was very welcoming and warm feeling all around the hotel . room very clean . all that I could expect was there . I will come back to this hotel . this is a good example of the best A ##cco ##r hotel in the chain [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for 3 nights while visiting Chicago . This hotel was chosen for its location , within easy walking distance to tourist sites , and public transit , and the positive reviews on trip advisor . We were not disappointed . The staff were helpful , the room was comfortable and clean . The extra per ##ks included a compliment ##ary breakfast served b ##uff ##et style just outside the elevator on each floor , and app ##eti ##zers served from 5 : 00 to 8 : 00 pm . If you book with the hotel directly a night ##ly compliment ##ary drink is also offered . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was in a great location . The price was outstanding . En ##joy ##ed a family / friend trip before Christmas . The kids loved the pool . The free breakfast was very good . The rooms were spacious and allowed for all of us to hang out together . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 3 nights , and could not have been more pleased with our choice . The location is ideal , central ##ly located near the river , and parking is available at extra cost . Most striking are the staff , who were all welcoming , helpful , and pleasant to speak with . The de ##cor is beautiful , and the hotel is absolutely im ##ma ##culate . In the morning , coffee or tea is available in the lobby , and at 5 : 00 wine is served , both at no cost . There are animal print robes in the rooms for you to use while you are there , a nice touch . W ##i - fi is free if you are a member of their rewards program , which is free , so you might as well . You can arrange for a in - room massage ( provided by a separate company ) - - my friend had one and said it was wonderful . We will definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , attractive ##ly decorated rooms . Spa ##cious accommodation ##s with comfortable beds and other furnishings . Friendly and helpful staff from front desk , food service personnel and house ##keeping . Con ##ven ##ient location near shops and Millennium Park . Not offering compliment ##ary internet disappointing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Conrad over the 4th and were super pleased . The hotel is gorgeous with spacious and beautiful rooms . Very clean as well . Had a slight issue with check in which was handled well by staff . We will most definitely go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just completed a 6 - night stay at Kim ##pton ' s All ##egro in Chicago . The hotel is well located , & is clean , & convenient . It ' s an older building so the rooms are small , but well maintained . The beds are comfortable & the house ##keeping staff are efficient , thorough , & o ##bs ##er ##vant , catering to the w ##him ##s of guests , such as noticing the need for extra towels , bed pillow preferences , rest ##ock ##ing s ##ham ##po ##o , etc . The bathroom ##s are minus ##cule , but well - appointed considering the size . The bath towels are the terrible , small , rough & uncomfortable . The compliment ##ary co ##sm ##etics are good quality & well - stock ##ed . The front desk staff are pleasant . Late check ##outs involve a $ 25 per hour fee . After a $ 2 , 000 stay , that ' s di ##sta ##ste ##ful . Three & a half stars , at best [SEP]
0	[CLS] Need better supervision in the pool area with kids jumping from hot tub to the pool . Many guests were speaking out about it so i will be the voice for everyone . It has happened every time i stay here . Parents need to keep their kids from be ##having this way but the hotel can have someone in that area at all times also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Out ##dated room and amenities . No fridge in room . No newspapers at door or at front desk . Had to call to get room cleaned at 4 PM . Con ##cier ##ge very helpful . Very poor lighting in room - 3 small lamps plus overhead light at the door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent bout ##ique hotel with Love this hotel . The staff is awesome - over the top friendly and at ##ten ##tive . Lo ##bby and bar area is co ##zy but happening . Great location for dining and high end shopping . Room ##s are large and quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Spa ##cious , comfortable room with a beautiful bathroom ; helpful and friendly staff ; very good bar and restaurant ; excellent gym ; a few feet off Michigan Avenue ; all for an amazing price - strongly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Hotel because it was close to the Chicago Theater . The staff was excellent and the room was comfortable and larger than I expected for a center - of - the - city hotel . The have a daily " wine hour " at 5 PM which is a good place to meet other people and pass on tips about the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family gathered at the Palmer from all corners to celebrate a birthday . My room was clean and charming and H ##U ##GE for a big - city place . If I could remember the room number , I ’ d recommend it — 11th floor , double bed , corner . The no - longer operating fireplace was the defining feature . The room isn ’ t as yellowish as my p ##ix suggest . We enjoyed the lobby for hanging out and having a drink . Check out the upper level and its no ##ok ##s that over ##look the main floor . It was decorated for Christmas , but it was clear that it ’ s a very impressive place year round . Easy walk to the Bean . Excellent service . Star ##bu ##cks downstairs . I ’ d do it again in a heartbeat . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay in this hotel was good , the staff is excellent , they tried everything to make feel better , they change my room but didn ’ t work , he sleep quality was terrible , the pillows and the mattress are no good . The location of this hotel is beyond than excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we check in the wall paper in our bathroom was p ##iling and the toilet wasn ’ t bolted to the floor every time someone used the bathroom the toilet jumped [UNK] not worth the money you pay for the room [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was and elegant ##ly appointed room and very clean . The room service was on - time , not overly in ##f ##lated in price and nicely presented . Check - in was swift and court ##eous . View ##s of the lake was wonderful and very close to the Art Institute and Mill ##eni ##um Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If this had been a $ 100 / night hotel room , I ' d have given it a higher rating , but at over $ 325 ##US / night , it was not up to par . The room was dusty , the TV remote didn ' t work , the food was wa ##aa ##aa ##y over ##p ##rice ##d , and my request for a robe and razor were ignored , although the tip I left was gone when I returned to my room . When I contacted the front desk to in ##quire about the shuttle service to my conference , the staff answering was rude and had no idea what I was talking about . For the cost , you can certainly do better . I ' ve stayed at a few H ##ya ##tts over the years , and this one was the only one in which I had a bad experience . Give it a pass ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Came back to my room after a long day of meetings and night of social ##izing . I noticed that there were no clean towels in my room and all had been taken except 1 hung up hand towel and 2 wash cloth ##s . As it was late and I needed to get up early , I did not want to wait for the maid service to send up towels . In my experience , that ##s not a 5 minute wait , but more of a 30 - 45 minute wait . I walked into my room at 2 am . I called the next day and the front desk did not seem to care . They indicated they would have towels sent up but when I mentioned the room was cleaned the previous day but towels were not even rest ##ock ##ed , the response was " Ok , well I will have some sent . " There was no apology or any type of em ##pathy . I guess they don ##t care about people there . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our stay at the k ##im ##pton was f ##abulous . The de ##cor is eclectic vintage feel with exceptional staff . From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted with Chicago hospitality . Leah at the front desk was professional and her attention to detail was phenomena ##l . Leah is an asset to the Kim ##pton and made our stay so special . Thanks for a class ##y cool memorable weekend in Chi town ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am planning my June wedding reception at the Swiss ##ote ##l El ##eve Ball ##room and working with Veronica Navarro , Cat ##ering Sales Manager , and her team has been amazing . Everything from our initial visit to the venue up to our food tasting last weekend has been first class . We have stayed at the hotel a few times in the past year as well and the rooms are always clean , customer service is top notch , and the amenities are great . Veronica and her team have gone above and beyond during the planning process and I know the day of my wedding will be no different . They have made this process so easy and fun for me and my fi ##ance and I would highly recommend working with them for any type of event . Thank you to Veronica and the Swiss ##ote ##l for all that you have done ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for the weekend and didn ' t know what to expect . The room was great - nice size , com ##fy bed , loved the dual head shower . The fact that they put the continental breakfast on each floor was great . Super convenient . Con ##cier ##ge was fantastic on getting us coup ##ons for restaurants on directions to all of the places we wanted to go . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were visiting the Chicago area and this hotel was part of a times ##hare exchange we have with Disney . It was easy to access and was convenient ##ly located with walking distance to Mill ##ennial Park and the River Walk . It also was about a 20 minute walk to the Navy Pier . We had a nice light meal and a few good beers in the Columbus Ta ##p restaurant inside the hotel . We were traveling to Northwestern over several days , so it provided an easy route along Sheridan Drive and lake Michigan . The only price ##y part was v ##alet parking ( $ 72 / day ) but I suspect that is not uncommon for a downtown hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay at the Conrad and enjoyed it ’ s convenient location . The service at this hotel is top notch , the rooms are very nice and they have two great bars / restaurants . No ##yan ##e the roof top bar is perfect to get some sun and enjoy the views of the city . They have great su ##shi and cocktail ##s . Baptiste and Bo ##ttle has a huge b ##our ##bon list which my husband loved and a nice br ##unch on the weekends ! Very nice amenities in the room and the bed was heavenly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is really nice and central ##ly located . However . . . . it is really expensive with basically no amenities Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary coffee is only available from 4 - 6 am , internet is not free , no breakfast and $ 70 parking . The rooms are not very sound - proof so noise carried a lot and I woke up throughout the night as “ f ##estive ” guests came in throughout the night I would not stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed one night here while I was in town to visit the Christmas Market . The hotel was decorated so beautifully for the holidays . My room had a fantastic view of the Chicago River . The staff was friendly and helpful with restaurant ideas and such . I ' m a fan of Kim ##pton Properties and really enjoyed my evening at the Monaco in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My experience ( 3 nights ) has been simply outstanding . Conference facilities , guest rooms , food , and service have all exceeded my expectations . Good job Swiss ##ote ##l staff and management . ( Photo : view from the gym ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hotel is 3 ##stars ma ##x 1 El ##eva ##tor out of 2 doesn ’ t work for a long time . Kitchen smell is spread throughout the hotel . Noise coming from a / c con ##den ##ser ##s can be heard in the room and this is so annoying ! A ##vo ##id ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has a modern v ##ibe , clean room , and all you need for a work trip . It is located close to many restaurants and things to do . The complementary water at check in is a nice touch . If i was returning for business , I would not hesitant to stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My experience at the O ##m ##ni Hotel in the wind ##y City was excellent . A great location and the employees are very friendly . They made sure I had everything I needed to feel right at home . Make sure you check into the O ##m ##ni the next time you got to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay in downtown Chicago . Across from an iconic restaurant and near lake shore drive . The staff was excellent especially Michelle . She went over and above to make sure we were welcome and appreciated . Room was cool and clean . Thank you so much we will be back [SEP]
0	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago is located in the heart of Chicago Loop and is within walking distance from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Navy Pier , and Millennium Park . We selected a river facing room and were put up in room 160 ##1 . This room offered us great views of the river , Navy Pier , and the Lake . We were celebrating my birthday , and the hotel surprised us with a lovely gift - champagne and dessert ##s delivered to our room ! Great visit overall and I would recommend Swiss ##ote ##l to anyone wanting to stay in downtown Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ed to Chicago for a work event and stayed here . The location is just great ! Near the Chicago River , Navy Pier , etc . Easy walking distance to most of downtown . A ##wes ##ome view from the 31st floor . Check in was quick and efficient . If you like a nice steak dinner , Shu ##la ' s St ##eak ##house is really good . We also enjoyed the lobby bar - great service and some awesome s ##pice ##d nuts . Fitness facility was very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just back from a four night stay and what a great hotel this is . Beautiful large rooms with com ##fy beds . Nice bathroom ##s with powerful shower ##s and very decent room service at good prices . The bar area is very cool as are all communal areas . The hotel is in a lovely part of the city , just a 20 min s ##tro ##ll to downtown . Can ' t understand why Public Chicago isn ' t higher up the Trip ##A ##d ##visor list because for me , it ' s a superb hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The inter ##continent ##al hotel is very well located , in downtown ! Could not be better . The hotel may need some works in the near future . I stayed in a room for hand ##ica ##ps , so not sure if all have the same characteristics . Mine was very big , with the shower directly in the floor , si everything was wet after a shower . The bed was king size and very comfortable . First day i decided to have the breakfast in the hotel . The bill was a not nice surprise : from the b ##uff ##et so not special - 34 do ##lar ##es . All other days i went to Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We only stayed one night , but the impression I have from this brief stay is overwhelming ##ly positive . They manage to make the place , especially the rooms , feel home ##y while maintaining that crisp , clean hotel feel . Extra k ##udo ##s to D ##wayne the bell ##hop , who was not only helpful , but also truly persona ##ble . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay . Don ' t order scrambled eggs from room service because they are powder ##ed . Otherwise great stay and room service food . Location is second to none for Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping and dining . Great staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The only positive points are the location and the pleasant staff . Otherwise , we had to take a room for disabled people to have a good sized bathroom and we suppose that the management think that di ##sable people are deaf . The metro start at 3 ##h ##5 ##6 and stops very late at night , and around 7 o ’ clock AM there is one train every minute . So if you want to sleep , go elsewhere . And there might be a very very nice historic painted ceiling in the lobby , because you have time to admire it , first time we had to que ##ue up half an hour to get a breakfast table in an hotel . we didn ’ t exactly understand why because there were a few empty table when we got in . Same thing , que ##ue to get a table for diner , and the restaurant was almost empty . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After not seeing my mother in years , our family decided to surprise her for her birthday ! Since she booked her stay at kin ##zie hotel , the whole family book a stay there too ! She had no idea that we would all be here ! We decided to hide in the lounge on the 6th floor , and that ’ s where we met the bartender , Josh ! He did not hesitate to jump on board with the surprise and came up with plenty of ideas , had the front desk help out with alert ##ing us of their arrival , and allowing the kids to hide behind the bar where he was ! He recorded clips of this very special moment , we could have not been happier with our decision to stay at this hotel ! The location is perfect , the night life is amazing and so are the city views ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely Chicago classic that is very family friendly . I got a daily con ##cier ##ge text to see if we needed anything , which was nice touch but the highlight of this stay is their pool . It ' s a beautiful ( huge ) vintage hotel pool with plenty of room for lap swim or fun swimming . It ' s located with in a lovely spa area and the kids had a ball there ! Walk right out to all the fun of Michigan Ave ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was celebrating my 25th wedding anniversary and wanted a place within walking distance to major restaurants and entertainment . This place hit on both . G ##reet ##ed with great attitudes from the friendly staff . Come see what they have to offer . Happy hour and breakfast are included every day . [SEP]
0	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago offered a beautiful view of the river and excellent dining . We were able to walk only a few blocks to the symphony , Nord ##strom ##s , and fine dining off - site . The staff was very friendly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ambassador is by far our favorite place to stay when visiting Chicago . The location , accommodation ##s and am ##bie ##nce are superb . But what distinguish ##es the Ambassador from all others is the service standard . The staff members , especially B ##re who helped coordinate our visit , are amazing . They go over and above the call of duty to ensure your visit is everything you desire . They are at ##ten ##tive , re ##sp ##ons ##ive , helpful and friendly . They will know your name and anti ##ci ##pate your needs . We had a family reunion and everything was perfect . We think of the Ambassador as our “ home away from home ” . Why would you stay anywhere else if you have the opportunity to stay at the Ambassador ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been at the hotel for over a month on an extended stay . Overall the v ##alet team is E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##T . Dominic and Dimitri are always helpful and friendly to not only me but to everyone I see them come in contact with . Am ##er , one of the Vale ##t ' s is always pleasant and helpful , usually calls me Sir and expresses to me to have a nice day every time he brings my car . All the v ##alet ##s are top notch too . Your front desk night team of Diane and Heidi are the best I have ever dealt with . Always friendly and helpful . Making my long stay that much nice ##r [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice , spacious room with a super com ##fy bed . The compliment ##ary happy hour was great with craft beer . The location is centralized to downtown and walking distance to several attractions . Overall excellent experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie bout ##ique hotel in Chicago a few times now and will never stay anywhere else ! Every time we go we feel so special and taken care of by the staff ! They go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and to accommodate any need you have . We worked with Gerry from booking our room , to check in , to finding us an awesome parking deal , and more ! We will never even consider staying anywhere else than the Ki ##nz ##ie in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I came to Chicago for a wedding and decided to stay for the weekend at the Fair ##mont . We booked a room on the 37th floor in one of their suites and we were both blown away by the views , suite , and service . The v ##alet was wonderful taking care of our bags and car , the check in staff were great and our room was ready 4 hours earlier than expected . We also had access to the gold members lounge and the staff and food there were excellent ! We were only there for 2 nights and 3 days for a wedding but we both felt like we were on vacation . This was our first time staying in Chicago as well as our first time staying in a Fair ##mont hotel . We definitely want to make a trip back to the Fair ##mont Chicago and plan on visiting other Fair ##mont locations in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador Chicago is in the perfect location if you want to stay in Gold Coast . . The service at this hotel is first rate and all the employees provide service with a smile . . B ##re at the front desk is an absolute delight ! This Ambassador is our new " go - to " hotel when we visit our family in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am a loyal Hilton member and am extremely disappointed with this hotel . It ’ s very old and dated with no views at all out of our room . It ’ s very expensive for zero luxury . The front desk charged my credit card double the amount of my booking confirmation in ##vo ##ice . When I went back to ask about it , after 15 minutes of terrible explanations , they said they ’ d charged me for the “ compliment ##ary ” upgrade ? ! I wouldn ’ t stay here if you ’ re visiting Chicago . I definitely won ’ t be staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved our stay at the So ##fit ##el Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The staff was kind , knowledge ##able , and very helpful in answering all our questions . Our room was clean and the bed was very comfortable . We would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed in Chicago but usually at the Gwen which is a great hotel . However I prefer Hilton over SP ##G an ##ls I find their service and management to have higher standards . I thought the quality of the room was great , the online check in and digital key worked really well and allowed us to skip check in . We checked out by calling the front desk in the morning so the whole stay was effort ##less . The amenities , food and general am ##bie ##nce is excellent . The room service menu is a little limited - no past ##a or pizza dishes however the b ##urger ##s we had were ta ##sty . Clean ##liness was excellent my new f ##ave hotel in ch ##ica ##go [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a week at this hotel . There were 4 of us with 2 teenagers and it served our needs based on its central location , room types , and amenities . Other than a small issue with over ##book ##ing on the first night , they did address the issue and we were satisfied . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Several steps down from the top of the chain 4 Seasons , a couple steps down from the Fair ##mont , this is the “ good ” of the Sears Roe ##bu ##ck “ good , better , best ” rating scale . I will throw in another 1 / 2 star because Eddy and Andy provided perfect ma ##rt ##ini ##s and er ##udi ##te conversation at the bar . The ABA uses this hotel in alternating years for its convention , so if you di ##s ##dain lawyers avoid staying in early August , it may be your un ##luck ##y year . Show ##er not big enough to turn around , towels provide full body ex ##folia ##tion . Location a bit of an hike for family restaurants , unless your kids are rich and like to eat at “ The Palm ” which is downstairs . If the rates are good and you don ’ t need a pool , go for good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were treated very well at this classic hotel . You can feel the history in all of it ' s grace ##s . The staff were lovely and warm . I would however skip the hotel bar and the d ##rak ##e across the street unless you want a beer or something simple . No one knows how to mix classic cocktail ##s with any skill . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After recent stays at two other really de ##pressing Fair ##mont properties , this location was a welcome surprise . I had a lovely , spacious room . Recently renovated , generous ##ly sized bathroom . Great location and very pleasant employees . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Looking after room were great and the staff in 67 ##6 restaurant on the 4 th floor could not have been nice ##r and helpful Food and drinks fine and rooms were nice and big bright clean and very comfortable . Will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights for a Business Conference . Every time I stopped in , Connie asked if I needed anything , etc . She was at ##ten ##tive , but not hovering . [UNK] Keep up the great service Connie ! I hope that you are rewarded for being such a dedicated employee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this River North facility for a business stay , which was 3 nights . Room was comfortable and air ##y w / good lighting . The continental breakfast on every floor was a great addition . The front house staff were a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting in holding my bags while I went to lunch and waited for the room to be prepared . Hop ##ing to plan another stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie in May ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in great a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting adjusted to our needs I need an R ##x re ##f ##rig ##erated they provided a fridge . The bell desk did lose our lap top which we run our business on . Was eventually found on a shelf in the bell closet and Fed ex ' d to us . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I would like to comment how pleased my husband and I were with the service provided to us at the So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . So ##fit ##el exceeded our expectations every step of the way . The location was perfect , the staff was amazing , the room was spacious ; best bed I have ever slept on , etc . . . I would and have recommended this hotel to everyone ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel staff went beyond , it was an amazing stay with excellent service ! Already at Check in everything was very well organized and I even found a bottle of wine in my room ! Just a memorable stay ! will be back soon [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived on Friday , March 19th , 202 ##1 for a weekend get away . Sad ##ly , we ended up finding a large cock ##roach in our bathroom . The management was a ##pol ##og ##etic and offered to move us down the hall to another room . Unfortunately , we felt that was not good enough . Not sure what would have made us comfortable to stay in the hotel after finding the cock ##roach . So we quickly checked out and stayed at another hotel . We were so disappointed . I was very grateful to the cu ##sto ##dian who quickly came to our room and disposed of the c ##rit ##ter . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First of all I would like to give credit to Victor the bell ##man who was very at ##ten ##tive and helpful and made my first interaction with hotel staff very pleasant . The rooms are great and spacious with great views of the Millennium park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##HA ##N ##K YOU to Ted , the maintenance person who kindly helped mit ##igate the leaking ceiling in our bathroom . The bucket really helped . He was ( genuinely ) kind and understanding and voluntarily talked to security about the party happening on the floor above us . T ##HA ##N ##K YOU to the front office manager , Rose ##mar ##ie , who kindly gave us her direct phone number in case we had additional concerns about our room key repeatedly not working ( five times was the magic number ) . Never mind that the phone number went to nowhere with no voice ##mail or anyone to answer it . T ##HA ##N ##K YOU to the people at the front desk who were true to their authentic se ##lves and didn ’ t even pretend to care that some of their customers were frustrated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had limited my expectations for my stay here based upon the reviews of others , but I was very pleasant ##ly surprised . I thought that all of the staff - at check - in , in the coffee shop downstairs , and at the bar at Shu ##la ' s steak house - were friendly , helpful , and went above and beyond . My gold status with Star ##wood was recognized , I had a beautiful room on the 25th floor with an amazing view , and the bed was comfortable . I love the walk from the hotel along the river to Michigan Ave . Great location as well . Grant ##ed , it ' s not the R ##itz or Four Seasons - it ' s a 4 star hotel , but is priced accordingly and delivers solid ##ly on that . I come to Chicago a few times a year for business , and will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the gorgeous pool , and the hotel ' s location is really convenient to shopping , Navy Pier and other attractions . The staff were really nice , too , but the house ##keeping could be a little better and if you stay on a weekend , it may sound like you ' re sleeping above a night club - the music from weddings and other events in the ballroom is really loud . Overall , the hotel was a good value for the location , service and pool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Yep , it ' s OK . The problem with that is that the Conrad is a luxury brand . The room was fine , albeit smaller than what I had booked , which was disappointing . Service throughout the hotel is friendly , and the bar is nice with professional bartender ##s ( though the blood ma ##ry mix is awful ; op ##t for something else ) . The room itself was very comfortable . The coffee maker and shower were fantastic . My two big issues were not getting the room I booked , and a s ##not on the wall of the bathroom when we checked in . Gross . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##ble to walk to the Kris ##t ##kind ##le market and downtown Macy ' s . U ##ber price around ##12 . 00 to go to Navy Pier and museums . Great fitness room . Nice restaurant and there is a sitting / eating area near the fitness room with a microwave . We requested a quiet room and it was quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , quick and early check - in . Right on Michigan Avenue in the heart of it all . Clean , quiet and comfortable . The swimming pool and b ##uff ##et breakfast were wonderful . Would certainly stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] High ##ly recommended , great location and view , the room is very comfortable and very clean and the customer service was outstanding . I went for a business trip the company pay ##ed for two nights and I pay ##ed for the first and the last night , the price was great com ##per ##ing to other Hotels in the city , I really enjoyed the stay and I definitely choose the same hotel for my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We set up a room block here for our wedding and got ready here before all the events . They set up women with hair and makeup appointments in rooms with big bathroom ##s and Murphy beds ( which fold into the wall to make more room for getting ready ) , and brought us bar stool ##s and steamer ##s . I was impressed with the rooms and lobby area , the v ##alet , and service . One major set ##back , though : they didn ' t clean our room between getting ready for the wedding and returning as newly ##wed ##s . It was a mess and the bed was still up in the wall . I wasn ' t expecting rose petals or anything , but w ##ow would it have been nice not to be rear ##rang ##ing the room in my gown at the end of a very long day . . . They also didn ' t put us on floors close to each other , which I had requested multiple times . [SEP]
1	[CLS] He had a great stay at Hotel Al ##egro . The entire staff was f ##abulous and at ##ten ##tive . Fun Pro ##se ##cco reception at 5 pm in up ##beat bar / lounge area . Great location in the loop and close to lots of attractions and great restaurants . Room ##s were class ##y with all the amenities . We love all Kim ##pton properties . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly staff . Clean , contemporary rooms . Not a single thing was wrong in a 3 night stay for a family of 3 . Very close to everything including great shopping and restaurants . Thanks for helping make our get ##away trip to Chicago fantastic ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s price ##y but the American Girl Pack ##age was very nice . The hotel cater ##s to the girls and their dolls and is great fun . The ##r staff is very helpful and the service was excellent . The favorite was the O ##m ##ni Resort robe for the doll to take home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the Talbot ##t on our last visit to Chicago and have booked twice again in the next couple months . The hotel has been refurbished with new beds , big screen TV , bathroom ##s and W ##i ##F ##i connections , so accommodation ##s are new and nice . The restaurant is now lovely and larger and good for any meal or drinks . Best of all is the service . You immediately feel welcome and cared for . Coffee and tea are a welcoming treat . They go way more than 100 % with anything you might need . Pro ##mpt and efficient . Perry , who greeted us and helped with our luggage even taught me how to use U ##ber when I asked him for help . Such a great guy ! We enjoyed our stay , and as I said will be back soon . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have no complaints about the So ##fit ##el . I loved the black ##out shades , the bed was super comfortable . The shower was amazing . One of the best parts , was that I couldn ' t hear any of my neighbors . The staff were super friendly . Check in and out was a breeze . I highly recommend staying at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here while on business . I was surprised when I arrived . The lobby is on the second floor and is open to a lounge and bar . They offer free drink for an hour in the evening and coffee and tea in the morning . The de ##cor is spun ##ky and bright . Fe ##lt like I went back in time . It had a good v ##ibe . Now about the room . The entrance in narrow and the bathroom is small . The room was small but big enough for 1 - 2 people . The bed was comfortable with two huge decorative pillow with color to give the room a pop of color . The only think that made me a little uncomfortable was that the door has a chain instead of a la ##tch . Overall it was a nice place with Star ##bu ##cks on the first floor and Du ##nk ##in ' Don ##uts across the street . [SEP]

1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont is an old and tired hotel . I had to stay there as my work booked it for me . I wouldn ’ t stay at this property on my own accord ( check out the Ra ##dis ##son Blu across the street , which is much better ) . Further details . . .

1	[CLS] We decided to take a last minute trip to Chicago over Memorial Day Weekend . I found a good rate at the Conrad Hilton and it had good reviews so we booked it . The hotel is new and beautiful . It is a half block off Michigan Avenue on Erie , smack it the middle of everything . The room was great . Floor to ceiling windows , awesome bed and linen ##s , great bathroom with a walk in shower , and us ##b ports to charge to your hearts desire . We will s ##tat there again ! ! ! [SEP]

0	[CLS] Everything here is exactly as you imagine it should be in a hotel . The de ##cor . The food in the daily happy hour . The attitude of the staff . The quality of the toilet ##ries . Their motto is " we get it " . They really do . Someone here , has clearly put a lot of thought and effort into making this the kind of place that you are glad to come to . It ' s not the most luxurious ; it ' s not high concept ; it ' s not the largest . It doesn ' t have a great lobby or bar . It ' s just a place where everything is exactly right . [SEP]

Breakfast was light and just what you need to get day started . The reception for guests from 5 - 7 ##pm was a perfect way to start each evening . I will stay again and recommend to everyone . I could not be happier with where I chose to stay on my first visit to Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Palmer House offers consistent excellence . This state ##ly hotel is truly one of America ' s classic big city hotels offering great location , beautiful lobby and overall el ##egan ##ce . High ##ly recommend for a couples get ##away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is what I would expect from a Holiday Inn or Micro ##tel . The bedroom was nice , but the bathroom was me ##dio ##cre . Although there were 4 elevators , only 2 appeared to be working and the wait was long in the mornings . The lobby is a zoo - - too many people trying to check in with only 3 agents working . The door ##man was mostly absent - - we hailed our own cab ##s and brought it our own luggage . I will never stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here while passing through & although we normally stay further north this area was nice as well & convenient ##ly located to Grant Park . The hotel is huge & there were some s ##hady acting people coming in but fortunate ##ly there was a guard by the elevators that you had to show your key to . The lobby is beautiful & the two queen / two bath room was adequate . We had a partial view of the lake . We won ’ t be staying here again . We feel like there are much better choices . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and this was a business trip . For personal I would have never chosen this hotel , its too expensive and like a " factory " of rooms and service . I prefer something smaller and nice ##r to stay . The food is terrible , but any hotel of this size in Chicago the food is terrible , no further comments . I had severe stomach ache and not even special diet dish were able to serve . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book online and you think you have paid , but there were more charges in the hotel . $ 10 per night facilities charge . Yes . Extra . But still probably worth the deal . The room is about the size of an interior room on a cruise ship . Bar ##ely enough room to wheel your carry - on suitcase between the bed and the wall . That said , we liked the hotel for location , clean ##liness , and safety [SEP]
1	[CLS] They will be extra charge ##rs for everything . . . They do not charge for the toilet paper because it would be too much . The have an en ##tic ##ing price to get you in but once you end up paying for everything you could have stayed at a 6 star hotel . The hotel is old , in a good location but because of the location they will take advantage of you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited Chicago for a weekend and stayed at the Conrad . The hotel is in an excellent location , with great rooms , views and amenities . The staff was great as well . The only down ##side is the parking as it is $ 70 . 00 to park at the hotel so we found a lot a block away for less than 1 / 2 the price . and self parked as we didn ' t need the car at all during our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great food just downstairs and we even got into our room early on New Years Eve day so that we ’ d have plenty of time to get ready for the night . Location couldn ’ t be better also ! ! ! Short 5 minute cab ride to anywhere you ’ ll want to go . Best bang for your b ##uck hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##mp ##ete ##nt but the restaurants and bars seem to be in flux . Some car ##pent ##ry in the room was not right . I think the lobby needs re ##thin ##king . The food was well made but I don ' t want to eat in a bar , where is the dining room ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the first moment to the last , H ##ya ##tt treated us wonderful ##ly . Every hotel employee was plea ##sing ##ly engaging and interactive , no matter their position . We only visited the restaurant for the breakfast b ##uff ##et , but it had everything you could want plus fresh a o ##mel ##ette station . We used the v ##alet for parking , $ 70 / day , simply because there really isn ' t another reasonable option , but it was worth it in the end . Property is close to everything . . River ##walk , mile ##nium park , navy pier , trains / buses , dining . . . Love ##d my visit to Chicago thanks to H ##ya ##tt . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in a great area of Chicago where you can walk to everything . The rooms are amazing . . . . large and comfortable with all of the modern convenience ##s . Ex ##quisite bed and bed ##ding ; giant 65 " TV screen , perfectly - appointed bathroom with dual sinks , gigantic mirror and a big shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our overall stay was mixed but we received extraordinary service in the gold floor lounge by Pat ##ric ##io Card ##ena ##s . Much k ##udo ##s to him and other gold floor staff for their service . Other issues with the hotel had to do with lack of services after 11 ##pm including room service and other requests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand for St Patrick ' s Day 2019 - - the hotel is not only located right on the river , but overlooking right where they turn the river green . We had a front row view ! The hotel has a huge lobby - great for meeting up with your group . They had a quick hotel bar and also were located near to a few other restaurants / bars . Quick walk over the river to the Loop and located at the start of Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Miles - tons of shopping . The rooms were clean and quiet . We definitely would stay at this property again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s hot . One staff member rude . Room was changed and still warm . Never got below 69 degrees even while the ##rm ##ost ##at set on 65 for 2 days . Left lights off , blind ##s shut and no difference . Re ##quest ##ed fan , told would get one by extremely rude staff lady then after 2 hours , she said they were our . Next day called to check and told there was a wait list but I wasn ' t on it as she didn ' t offer it to me the day before . $ 300 a night , should be cool in room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great spot for date night . It was a quiet spot we could enjoy each other with the comfort of a home feel . It was close to the shopping and rest ##ura ##nts that you could walk and not take taxi ##s and U ##ber ' s to get where you wanted to go . D ##wayne is an asset to the hotel and is the nice ##st man and super helpful to everyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t to the river north area to visit friends . Also to see a show and eat dinner . The hotel staff was on strike . The rooms were im ##ma ##culate , the staff was well trained and made our stay wonderful . Park ##ing was 64 dollars a little steep for a farm boy from Wisconsin [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s was super spacious , clean and art ##fully decorated . Love ##d the modern feel . The staff was above and beyond friendly . Would definitely stay at this hotel again . We had breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel and it was delight ##ful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is f ##abulous : quick walk to the train station , right by the L , two blocks from the M ##M , etc . The suite was a great set - up for our family of three . Having a full kitchen plus the evening social ##s meant we could save money on meals out . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago is what you would expect from a H ##ya ##tt property . I have stayed there 3 times in less than a year and found consistency every time . Staff is very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Room ##s are extremely quiet and very clean . Special requests are addressed promptly . The Regency Club lounge was exceptional compared to other H ##ya ##tt hotels and I really appreciated that it was open on the weekends with all the same amenities . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was in the heart of the central business district of Chicago but the manager and other associates really went out of their way to make guests comfortable . I was quite surprised because I expected it to be more imp ##erson ##al . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Extreme ##ly noisy in rooms at back . G ##ar ##bage collection at 3 a . m , no coffee / tea machine in room . We checked out after 3 nights of what should have been a 6 night stay . No questions at check out about or stay or reasons for checking out early . An OK hotel but not worth the cost . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is my favorite hotel now downtown Chicago very clean professional staff close too nice bars great food I don ’ t ya e one complaint about this place they even had a complementary happy hour with drinks it was great [SEP]
1	[CLS] From A to Z - this place sucks . I was prepared for a lovely stay on the magnificent mile . W ##oo w ##oo w ##oo - this place is out ##dated with sur ##ly staff , ugly rooms , dirty bathroom ##s , hidden fees , very little parking , no f ##rill ##s . . . I mean even Holiday Inn is better that this host ##el like sleeping experience . They didn ’ t even give us cups for their crap ##py coffee machines . And don ’ t bother calling reception - nobody answers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My Fi ##rm had a short conference here and I stayed 3 nights . My room had a river view , the gym was ( by hotel standards ) fantastic , and I really enjoyed walking around the area . It helped that the weather was perfect . Although I can ’ t imagine what walking around the same area would be like in January . My only warning would be that the conference area is a maze . All ##ow plenty of time to get to you session . Wrong turns are easy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall we were satisfied with the hotel . We found the restaurants quite price ##y , but there were adequate restaurants within a short walk , especially for breakfast . Business meeting rooms were quite nice , and the climate control was adequate . We enjoyed having a refrigerator in the room ! . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Hotel on Erie in the middle of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile is a jewel of a hotel . It is part of the Hilton Hotels . The hotel and it ' s staff are totally dedicated to its guests . The room are spacious and spot ##less . Your every need is anticipated and accommodate ##d . Yet the s ##ta ##f is un ##ob ##tr ##usive until you need assistance . What a pleasant surprise . This hotel enhanced the pleasure of visiting this beautiful city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed my stay at this hotel . Location is great as it ’ s central ##ly located in River North . Room was great and happy hour was amazing ! The only downfall is the continental breakfast was ok for a grab and go but I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in one of the updated rooms and found the de ##cor to be done in very nice taste . Thought the size of the room was big compared to other rooms we have stayed in big cities . The bathroom was large with a very nice shower and also a tub . Love ##d the blind ##s that you can control by your bedside ! ! ! Was able to walk to most places with the great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at Hotel All ##egro for a few nights and were very pleased with our experience there . Very clean and comfortable room , friendly staff , nice fitness center and within walking distance to most of everything tourist ##y . The free coffee and hot chocolate bar in the lobby was a nice touch too . Only negative was the thin walls , but that ' s really only a minor detail that did not bother us much . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bed ##ding was comfortable . I was able to cool the room to 65 ##F and sleep well . But the shower had a rain head with more water pressure and flow than any I ' ve ever seen . Nice ! The Michael Jordan in house bar is convenient . Vale ##t parking was helpful . The Purple Pig across the street has a large wine list , several by the glass , and serves unusual small plate dishes , [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town just to see Hamilton . I called a few days prior to our stay and told Drake it was a very special trip for my grandson . He reserved a room for us on the fourth floor . It was quiet , extremely clean and fresh feeling and easily accommodate ##d four people . The room said two full ##s , but I think they were queen ##s . There was also a set ##tee / day ##bed that my grandson decided was just right for him . We arrived early and the room wasn ' t ready , but Drake remembered speaking to me . He arranged to store our luggage , suggested things to do and see and texted me when the room was ready . The hotel was located an easy walk to Navy Pier , Mill ##ennial Park , theaters and the River Walk . I would recommend the Ki ##nz ##ie for price , location , friend ##liness , and clean ##liness . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I have stayed at this hotel a few times and typically it has been wonderful . This time around , there was a used wash cloth in the bathroom when we checked in and a half full bottle of mouth ##wash with the amenities . Made me wonder what else they ski ##mp ##ed on when they cleaned the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a te ##rri ##fic weekend at the new , ups ##cale Conrad Chicago . It is located in the center of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping area making shopping all the more convenient . The bathroom ##s are large and gorgeous with double sinks and a huge marble shower . As a tea drink ##er I really liked the electric tea k ##ett ##le as making tea with the coffee maker usually leaves a coffee flavor which isn ' t appreciated . On Friday evening the roof top bar / restaurant was doing a br ##isk business on a lovely warm evening . Everyone of the hotel staff we interact ##ed with were pleasant and helpful . Would definitely stay here on all future trips . [SEP]
1	[CLS] it has been a while since I was there , 1997 to be exact . my first time to the wind ##y city . I chose this hotel via the location , and the rating . It was an older type hotel but V ##ER ##Y nice . The Staff was very helpful . the only thing I didn ' t care for was the Vale ##t parking , B ##UT that is the way every hotel in that area does it . had to call down about 15 min ##s early to let them go and get the car and bring it to the hotel . Over all it was nice for them to do the leg work . If I ever get back to Chicago I will stay there again . . It was just a couple blocks from the Lake and the Water ##tower and Ma ##g . Mile shopping . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A perfect location in downtown Chicago with proximity to Museums , theatrical shows , restaurants , and music venues . The staff is customer focused and therefore extremely helpful . The fitness center is remarkable with an indoor padded running track . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable accommodation ##s in perfect location for business meetings downtown or an ex ##po at McCormick Center ( 1 / 2 block from shuttle bus service ) . Some rooms have te ##rri ##fic views of the river and the lake shore . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel lives up to the Conrad Hilton name . Our room was luxurious , spacious and comfortable with a lovely City view . The location was perfect for a little N . Michigan Avenue shopping . The only downfall is we only stayed one night ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] wife was in this lovely hotel for work . I am states away . she is there on v ##ale ##ntin ##es day . called and spoke with Ms . Brown and Mr .

1	[CLS] Check ##ed in for one night and experienced great service as always . Restaurant excellent for dinner and breakfast . Room was comfortable and clean . El ##eva ##tors always quick and location is great for shows and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are staying for more than two days , you need a suite ! I found that the prices at the O ##m ##ni were not much more than prices at a single bed hotel . Everyone that we interact ##ed with at the hotel were as nice as could be . There are no fridge ##s in the room , so you will need to request one at check - in ; they ' ll bring it up very quickly . We went to the W ##al ##green ##s down the street and loaded up on snack ##s / drinks for the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a conference . We had a corner room with a wonderful view of the river and lake . The rooms are very nice and very clean . The only complaint we had was that the ice machine was broken on our floor all 4 days we stayed here . Since the rooms do not have a mini fridge we took a small cooler and had to go to various floors to get ice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is so soothing to visit , it ' s a beautiful building next to a tiny patch of garden in the middle of a world class city . It ' s walking distance to so many wonderful shops and restaurants , it ' s really worth a visit . We booked a suite which , while it did not have the best view , it was incredibly spacious . The bathroom was luxurious with a large tub and separate shower and her ##mes branded toilet ##ries . The con ##cier ##ge was helpful and we booked a massage . The spa at the hotel is being renovated so the massage was in room , I wasn ' t told that when I booked it but we figured it out eventually . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was small as was the bathroom . However , it was clean and comfortable and quiet . The front desk staff were friendly . The room was ready earlier than we were told it would be and check ##out was not until noon , which was nice ! [SEP]

0	[CLS] Had a pleasant stay at this hotel , in a great location in Chicago . The room we had was very nice , but I did not give 5 stars , as it is tired in places . The staff generally were pleasant and helpful . Would stay here again if visiting Chicago , if their price was right . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located a reasonable walk from the main attractions this hotel provides a comfortable stay . Room ##s are very large nicely furnished and clean . There ’ s a helpful con ##cier ##ge and the red line for the train is a 5 minute walk away . The restaurant has some nice food but limited choices . There are lots of breakfast choices a reasonable walk away in the area . The old pan ##cake house was good as well as Yo ##lk . A taxi takes about 45 minutes to and from O ’ Hare depend ##ant on traffic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located , comfortable and a ##cco ##mo ##dating . Staff very helpful . Both check ##in / check ##out were quick . En ##joy ##ed my stay . Bed was very comfortable , and room very clean . E ##asily recommend this hotel for those looking for a downtown convenient location [SEP]

1	[CLS] We booked rooms for a bachelor ##ette weekend and enjoyed our stay quite a bit . My only complaint is we couldn ' t schedule to have rooms ready ahead of time and then the front desk , once we arrived ( early ) , said they would let the housekeeper ##s know and try to ex ##ped ##ite our rooms . One of the rooms was ready 15 minutes A ##FT ##ER the standard check - in time . We requested when booking that the rooms be together , and while they were close , none of them were adjacent , which was too bad . Overall , the hotel was fairly quiet ( train in distance ) , very clean , and everyone was friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff was friendly and helpful . Room met all expectations and shower pressure and products were fantastic . V ##isi ##ted the bar and restaurant twice and bartender and server were friendly and quick . Overall a great experience ! [SEP]

Can ' t wait to return to this amazing city and yes we will be staying at the Public Hotel ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The All ##egro e ##voke ##s the charm of the early 20th century in an updated set ##ying . Kim ##pton has kept the unique character of an older property which is so welcome in this day of cookie cutter chain properties . The rooms are not large but are comfortable and clean . Great value ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a Mar ##riot ##t Titan ##ium member . I applied my S ##NA ##s and was upgraded to the Illinois Suite . The room was huge . The biggest down ##side was that it was not in the same tower as the club lounge , which made getting to the lounge a little more difficult . The club lounge was great . Connie and Rene are super friendly and the offerings were great . The location is great . It ’ s easily walk ##able to navy pier and Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well Train ##ed Staff , excellent facility and great location right there in the Madison Corner . Very accessible to prime restaurants and activities . It was very enjoyable stay .

1	[CLS] Love ##d this place . Lo ##bby is large and beautiful . Our room was cute , clean and comfortable . Staff were very friendly and helpful . Pro ##se ##cco at wine hour is a class ##y touch .

1	[CLS] Good location , great food and rooms are comfortable . Staff was kind and offered a package for me to attend to sky ##de ##ck at Willis Tower . Show ##er and amenities in room were fantastic . Great idea to put bigger size bottles for body lot ##ion , body wash and s ##ham ##po ##o . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying here . Came for holiday party . Room wasn ' t ready . Wait ##ed over hour , many guests in lobby waiting . No discount offered . Room itself disappointing . No lighting in bathroom or sink space . Fi ##an ##cé is getting ready in bedroom with lamp shade removed . No room on sink . Up ##graded to king suite for luxury two person tub . It ' s built more for two kids than two adults . At ##ta ##ched some picks , judge for yourself . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was b ##um ##med I was going to be in Chicago for work on my birthday and not have anything special to do . Lucy at the bar made me feel so at home and sang me “ happy birthday . ” The next day when I got back from work , there was a piece of cake with a note that a “ little bird ” told them it was my birthday . S ##hout ##out to Lucy , David , Leah , Paige and everyone at Hotel All ##egro for making my stay so incredible . This is not a birthday I will be forgetting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s a great hotel , very well located , close to the main m ##use ##us , the millennium park , the aquarium and other attractions . Very busy hotel , at least during our stay ( Dec / Jan ) ! I was expecting bigger rooms , when compared to the p ##ics I saw when booking , but it suited our purpose . Great inside pool , which made my daughter super happy [UNK] . The reception ##ists were wonderful . The negative : need to be honor member to get access to internet and gym ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Historic hotel , in an excellent location . The staff members were kind , professional , and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Mal ##com in particular went above and beyond to make our stay a great one . We had a great room with a nice view , all at a very reasonable price . We would stay here again , even if it meant paying more - this place is worth every penny . [SEP]

[SEP]
1	[CLS] You cannot beat the historic lobby , and the grand Christmas tree ! We did our annual December get - away here and enjoyed it very much ! Easy walk to Macy ' s windows , the seasonal Christ ##kind ##l Market , Michigan Avenue , the Bean and the Art Institute ( and I am sure much more ) . I found service at the Lo ##bby Bar lacking , but in their defense , it was the holiday season and pretty busy . We got a kick out of the celebrity photos on the walls going to our room . I recommend for a nice downtown visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A friend and I spent a week at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker over Christmas . It ' s a great old hotel with a ton of local history and charm . The rooms are clean , the staff are friendly , warm and helpful and the location can ' t be beat . The hotel bar is relaxing , and , while the food options are limited in the hotel , what ' s there is ta ##sty ( the location is so good you won ' t be eating many meals in anyway ) . I will def ##ini ##tley be back , and will stay here again . [SEP]

It is truly a historic hotel and they do tours on Friday ##s which are free and which I would have done had timing been right . However , no one seems happy to work here . The reception team were g ##rump ##y on our arrival and departure , we had to ask for an extra paper tea cup to take tea in our room on both nights of our stay and although given it was not given with good grace . The bar staff clearly prefer customers to select the choice of wine from a i ##Pad rather than engage in conversation to make a recommendation . Custom ##er service leaves a lot to be desired and this team could learn from the Premier Inn ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are not well kept , broken items , non - functioning wall plug ##s throughout , the smoke alarm went off one morning ( on its own ) and it took 30 minutes for someone to come turn it off ( all the time experiencing 90 + de ##ci ##bel noise ) . Don ' t count on House ##keeping to clean rooms before 6 pm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for Memorial Day weekend with family ( wife , two teenage ##d daughters ) to see friends in Chicago and do the tourist attractions . The hotel is in the heart of the River North neighborhood , lots of restaurant options and steps from Michigan Ave shopping . If you enjoy a walk , Navy Pier , Mill ##ini ##um Park , and the Hancock observatory are close . But the staff made our trip special . Jeremy was especially great , helping us a lot . My older daughter missed the coffee cream ##er , and Jeremy went to find some for her , so she didn ' t have to leave the breakfast table . Many thanks to Jo ##jo for adding birthday wishes for my wife to our reservation . Breakfast was pretty good ( and we stay at hotels that offer free breakfast ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our visit was fine - the location is good . The room was clean and the bed was comfortable . I will note that our bathroom had mold on the ceiling above the shower , which was unpleasant . I also thought the $ 30 per night upgrade fee was expensive , since we were told that our room wasn ' t ready unless we paid the upgrade fee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Te ##rri ##fic staff , great location and lovely room . Really enjoyed staying there and the price was extremely reasonable . It was extremely cold , but the outdoor staff person was very a ##cco ##mo ##dating getting us a taxi and helping with directions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s a great central location in the Loop , not far from the lake shore or other major attractions . The hotel was nice , funk ##y de ##cor inside the rooms , while the lobby did have an early 20th century theme to it . The rooms were a bit smaller than expected , and the bathroom was a little cramped . Very small breakfast provided , really only coffee and a few options for fruit , but there is a Star ##bu ##cks and another restaurant attached to the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 4 of us stayed at the Talbot ##t for 2 nights for a girls weekend . The bell ##man D ##wayne was so friendly and helpful . We worked him really hard with extra pillows and blankets . He was always there when we needed something . The Talbot ##t is close to all the great stores near Michigan Avenue and we just used an U ##ber for restaurants at night . Had a wonderful time and will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very room ##y suite . . . super location . Staff was very helpful and friendly . Room was not ready upon arrival , but they quickly found one and got us checked in . Had an issue with key not working but it was resolved quickly . Both minor issues that were handled very well ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Francesca is the whole reason we came to this city , hoping she wins this trip so she can come and visit . She was v persona ##ble and gave recommendations based on her favorites . We ’ ve been blessed with good weather Off ##rance ##sca . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this hotel . I was treated royal ##ly and was given a great room with a bit of a view of Lake Michigan . I did not see any “ p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper ” . Being a solo travel ##er can be difficult but the staff went over ##board to make this vacation a wonderful one . I thought the continental b ##uff ##et was great as I like salad ##s and sliced meat ##s for breakfast and they had that . The bar was a treat too . Great ma ##rt ##ini and super service . The lobby ceiling is incredible . The location great . En ##joy this historic hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment I stepped out if the taxi the hotel took care of my stay . Very friendly and helpful staff throughout and wonderful rooms to boot . The room was spacious , clean and well ordered . The food at my meeting was good although we had typical lunch fare . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I took my husband here for his birthday and to see a show at the Cadillac theater . I booked it considering it was January in Chicago and wanted to be close to there theater . Wow . The hotel itself is very beautiful . Our room was amazing . Clean , spacious , and we ' ll decorated . The bed was very comfortable . The restaurant attached is delicious , and would definitely recommend a reservation . The staff was very court ##eous and happy . High ##ly recommend , especially if you are planning on seeing a show . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was beautiful and in a fantastic ( walk ##able ) neighborhood . Close to the lake and downtown . The staff was amazing and very helpful , the food at the restaurant was delicious and we will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I arrived incredibly early , well before the afternoon check in . I checked my bags with the bell and made my way to get breakfast . Before I finished breakfast , I had a call from the hotel that my room was ready for me . The room was clean and had everything I needed for my short 2 night stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very welcoming stay at the Intercontinental in Chicago . G ##reet ##ed warmly at the front desk and everything was smooth . Love the pool area at this hotel . Had drinks / apps in the Michael Jordan bar ! Nice atmosphere if a little busy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is well situated close to Michigan Avenue on the River . Check - in was good , but room service was often difficult to reach . Room was at best average , with a broker drawer in one bed table and too little space on the other side . W ##if ##i worked well and was easy to access . Bath ##room was good , but staff failed to replace bath mat on one occasion . Lots of restaurants , but very crowded ( apparently a popular convention hotel ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Family of 5 & we had a spacious room ( two doubles with pull ##out ) on the top floor ! ! Unfortunately , we had no view , but still had a great stay . Didn ' t know about O ##m ##ni kids club - so we were surprised for the gift & milk & cookies . Bed ##s were comfortable , fridge was helpful . Two TV ##s . All awesome . Fitness room was very nice , pool is indoor & quite small - my kids were still very happy with it & the hot tub . Staff was all friendly . I would highly recommend the O ##m ##ni , especially if traveling with family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came for our 39th anniversary having been here several times before . This is my favorite pool in all the world - - the art de ##co style room plus a full 25 yard length going down to 10 feet deep . You just don ' t find that anymore . Wish there was a w ##hir ##l ##pool . We got upgraded and had a wonderful executive tower room with a living room as well . Inc ##red ##ible view of the sky ##line and river . Love the breakfast b ##uff ##et . Minor q ##ui ##bble ##s - - no slip ##pers even though there were great robes . Our room had 2 bathroom ##s but there was no ledge in one making it hard to put out toilet ##ries . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice comfortable hotel on the main bus and tram routes and a short walk from the city centre . The rooms were very clean and comfortable and well appointed . The breakfast ##s deserve a particular mention as it was fully waiter serviced with a wide range of choices . One g ##rum ##ble - a hotel of this quality should offer free W ##i ##F ##i not charge $ 10 per day for it . Chicago was a nice town with plenty of eat ##eries and places of interest . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super bar with architecture to match . Great place for pre - dinner cocktail ##s or to finish the evening off . Bar tender was on point and our glasses never ran dry . A bar ##man that knows how to make a classic ma ##rt ##ini without all the show ##manship is welcome relief . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Custom ##er service at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago was exceptional . I would highly recommend this property . From the time of check in to departure , I had a great experience . The banquet department was very polite and at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I Love ##d the room . You can tell this hotel has been recently updated and upgraded . Co ##m ##fort ##able window seats were a great place to relax and enjoy the city views . Night ##ly wine night provided a unexpected and enjoyed start to the evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent for the price and very comfortable and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The beds are small ##ish , so if you are sharing with someone unfamiliar , best to get two beds or two rooms . View of Lake Michigan was great and love the natural light in the bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed two nights and were very impressed with the standard of service we received . Everyone was so friendly and helpful . Our room was large and very clean and we got maid service between our two nights which surprised us . Door and front desk staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The architecture is breath ##taking . . circa 1928 . Room is modern with a low and com ##fy bed . Nice sofa and glass table makes it seem like an apartment and not a hotel room . In room snack ##s and mini bar / re ##f ##ridge . This hotel o ##oz ##es class and so ##phi ##stic ##ation . Best part is it ' s in a neighborhood in the Gold Coast , so no street traffic noise ! High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed one night and caught up with friends from CA . Need ##less to say it was very expensive and the charge for the garage for having a car is over the top expensive . I get there is no parking but j ##ee ##z way to much money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There were major issues with check in because what I was told upon booking was not the case when I checked in for business . Room was average . The bell men were very helpful and kind . The location was great , but not sure I would stay there again because of booking / check in experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing stay at the Kim ##pton properties . Staff was extremely pleasant as soon as we checked in . Pro ##vide ##d a cute puppy welcome bag with treats and pet friendly locations . Also pet bed an ##s bowls are available upon request . Ce ##le ##bra ##ted b ##day out ##ing and dropped off mini cup ##cakes and a hand written card . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary cocktail social was great . Would highly recommend to those traveling with pets ( no fees ) and in an amazing location ! Room ##s were com ##fy and plus ##h [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really liked the hotel . Great location , with shops , restaurants , bars and close the beaches of Lake Michigan . It has an old world charm about it , yet modern facilities . Only two minor points : the guest elevators were not working during my stay and the shower was not the best , not terrible , just not the best . Really com ##fy , large king size bed . Super effective air conditioning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed here and I must say the hotel is in a great location , rooms were comfortable and had all the necessary amenities . It ' s situated just off the magnificent mile so you can shop till your hearts content . The staff were very friendly and warm and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Thanks for a great stay [SEP]
0	[CLS] Room was very clean . Clean ##ing service did a good job . I liked location the most . Right in a heart of Chicago . I got my breakfast to my room and service was perfect - warm food , everything covered . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our go to ! We have stayed at many different places in downtown and we love this place ! Clean , trend ##y , and staff is amazing . We got an upgrade this time and it was spectacular . Great corner view room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is situated in a beautiful part of Chicago . Very quiet neighborhood but within walking distance to Lake and restaurants and shopping . The hotel staff was friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and professional . The hotel ' s am ##bie ##nce was old el ##egan ##ce with a European feel . The wedding venue was beautiful and the food was beyond excellent . Our suite room was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time in Chicago ! The team at the Monaco made us feel like at home ! Everyone is so caring and nice they all had great recommendations of were to go and what to do . specially the bell ##man Antonio he is a g ##em ! He has been with the hotel for over 20 years . . . so pleasant to talk to he always has a smile in his face . Everyone in the Front office team is amazing ! Abdul the Front office manager is great ! Ku ##dos to the house ##keeping team the rooms apart from being beautiful they are spot ##less clean ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Extreme ##ly clean rooms ! Trust me , if my wife sees anything on the bed , chair , bathroom , or floor that is disco ##lore ##d or disgusting she would march done to the front desk and tell them . This place was very clean and had nice little touches like a Ke ##uri ##g , a Bose stereo , etc . Would definitely stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Good experience and good location . It ' s an interesting place to stay with interesting history . Everything was really clean and welcoming . The staff was helpful , and the room was really nice . I enjoyed my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this property for years as it is central ##ly located and accommodate ##s our family . We were disappointed in the beds , pillows and blankets this time around . We think it ’ s time for this hotel to be updated with new beds , pillows and more comfortable bed ##ding . Otherwise we are very happy with the staff . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary beverages in the morning were nice but the hot ch ##ico ##late was water ##y and , it was Christmas , how hard is it to throw a little whipped cream or a few marsh ##mal ##lows in the cup ? Overall the staff is nice , but when we asked them to make up the pull - out were told it was already done and we could pull it out and set it up ourselves . Soo ##oo many other hotels to chose from downtown and I think it ’ s time to say goodbye to the O ##m ##ni . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our last night in Chicago and unfortunately our last night at The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel , as well . Not your typical hotel - small ( only 6 floors ) , super friendly service / advice , comfortable beds ( not too soft / not too firm ) , modern yet comfortable rooms w great architectural views , spot ##lessly clean and it ’ s only a block from the river . Lots of in ##vent ##ive details that are appreciated by tired travelers . Bonus ( es ) - an extensive continental breakfast in the am and a g ##rat ##is happy hour in the late afternoon . ( Mostly ) young ##ish client ##ele ( under 40 ) our teens were thrilled not to be surrounded by old folks . Without a doubt , I would recommend this hotel to friends and families with teens . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfectly situated for visiting the major tourist attractions in Chicago . The beds are extremely comfortable . The towels and robes are a little older and scratch ##y . The bath ##tub is shallow . The major disappointment , and not fault of the hotel , is that after paying for a room upgrade we opened the windows to see a giant " T ##R ##UM ##P " sign on the hotel opposite us . Was a little disappointed with the newspaper service . We tried to get one each day , but they were always all gone . I would suggest that the hotel ask guests if they would like a paper and then deliver it to their rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice . Would stay there again . Excellent service and location can ' t be beat . Make sure you check for discount ##s prior to check in . I didn ' t , my bad . Co ##st me $ 100 . Use AA ##RP , AAA , etc . Food was outstanding . You can walk to almost any attraction in downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent just one night there but it was a lovely stay ! A direct view of downtown and the Chicago River with really great service . I liked the fact that they would bring up essential ##s like em ##ery board , razor nail p ##olis ##h remove ##r hairs ##pra ##y etc . at no additional cost . They had an umbrella on loan and some really fun tell your bathroom ##s to use . The furniture was beautiful and very unique . It was a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean room . Good house ##keeping . Friendly , knowledge ##able and helpful staff . Reason ##ably priced . Excellent location . I would not hesitate to recommend the Ambassador Hotel to family and friends traveling to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ing at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago , you ' ll have a fantastic experience both inside and outside of the hotel . The hotel complex is spacious yet easy to navigate . Hotel staff were incredibly helpful with any questions and requests . Room ##s were clean , quiet and had all expected amenities , but some furniture ( wooden desk ##s and doors ) showed signs of wear such as deep scratch ##es and disco ##lora ##tion . Was pleasant ##ly surprised to find lounge and work areas around the hotel , great to work on a laptop or social ##ize . Outside , the hotel is walking distance from many Chicago attractions such as the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , Millennium Park , and the Art Institute . Park ##ing is paid ( but no surprise in this city ) but many parking garage ##s are available nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location with easy access to the McCormick convention centre and other hotels . Very good restaurants and food choices . Room with view of the lake and beautiful sunset ##s are best . P ##ric ##ing through Trip - Ad ##vise ##r are less than through other channels but I discovered this after booking ##s were made . Carr ##y a coat to protect against the cold winds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] amazing locations , great views - we stayed at 38th floor and it was amazing , the booking through Book ##ing . com was a bit messy but it may be caused by booking . com staff were helpful ##l and all very great experience , overall [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was not clean . The bathroom shower had mold all over it , the ceiling was stained from leak ##s , the wall ##paper was p ##eel ##ing and the sink didn ’ t drain properly and there were dried liquid stain ##s all over the walls . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##ff ##ord ##able , very nice , clean room in a great central location for shopping and restaurants . Nothing extra or super fancy but that ' s not what I needed or paid for . It looks like the building has history and I loved those details . I wish I ' d stayed longer so I could try the restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent service from check in , to dining to the con ##cier ##ge ( O ##s ##bal ##do " O ##b " ) . Very nice rooms : comfortable , well decorated . For a hotel they have an excellent gym as well . Great location . Will come back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , good staff . A sponsor ##ing hotel for the Chicago marathon . Initially we were told that late check ##out would cost an additional $ 150 . Fair ##ly un ##yi ##eld ##ing . And pretty annoying . To check out on Sunday before the race was over . But , asked a different person the next day , and we were very g ##rac ##iously offered a late check ##out at no charge . So , very happy in the end . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super ##b attention to detail and spectacular views . De ##fin ##ite ##ly worth the up charge to get a room with a river view on a top floor . Service was phenomena ##l . I will be returning next time I ' m in Chicago and will be checking for your locations during travel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 2 nights at the Palmer House - - just having been renovated . Our rooms were small but very quiet . No extra ##s like coffee in the room but there was a small refrigerator . The room was very clean and re ##f ##resh ##ed . The lobby was just beautiful and we ate one of the brown ##ies that they are known for ( not that spectacular ) . The old furniture on the floors was old - - many pieces probably needed to be recovered . it is a great location to be as a tourist - - easy access to tours , the River ##walk and shopping . Park ##ing is not cheap but was secure . All of the personnel we met were very professional and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , close to nice restaurants and Chicago river walk . Very clean rooms and excellent service ! High ##ly recommended . Especially Nik ##ko was very friendly and helpful to us ! We ’ ll definitely prefer your hotel at our next Chicago visit . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Me and my girlfriend wanted a downtown get ##away over the weekend and to explore the city . The millennium kn ##ick ##le ##bo ##cker was a great experience that we will never forget . We have stayed here twice on back to back weekends and have always gotten a wonderful breakfast from the restaurant in the lobby . The beds in the room are wonderful and com ##fy . The bathroom was gorgeous with a rain ##dr ##op shower ##head . The main feature of the rooms that cap ##ti ##vated us most was the view of lake Michigan outside the window . Upon arrival both times we were greeted by Diana who was very welcoming and warm . I ' m so happy we chose this hotel as our little downtown get ##away main ##sta ##y and we will be making our th ##rid trip this weekend ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel . Perfect location on the corner of Michigan and Hero ##n . Very friendly staff - front desk , bell ##men , house ##keeping - their focus on customer service is obvious . Nice restaurant and bar huge widow ##s overlooking Michigan Ave . Close to shopping , lake front - Room ##s are all suites , comfortable beds - nice amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 300 ##m from Grant Park is the main reason to stay in this hotel , as I joined Chicago Marathon last October 2019 . The hotel has 3 gates , make us easier to go every places . . . Lo ##bby on the 1st floor up , but they have lift access to rooms . With a Hilton standard and vintage de ##cor , we really enjoyed staying here . Price ##y . . . yes ! But worth it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the Talbot ##t for 3 nights with our one - year old son . Our room was comfortable and extremely clean . The hotel provided a c ##ri ##b for our son . We loved the free ( good ! ) coffee in the morning on our way out . The location cannot be beat with access to public transit , cab ##s and endless walking option around . We will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was very nice , view was great . I did have a little problem at check - out and the final bill ##ing , but after calling later on , they fixed it no questions . Staff were very re ##sp ##ons ##ive when I had questions ( like where is the closest Star ##bu ##cks ) . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I chose this hotel because of the brand . I have always had great experiences with Home ##wood Suite ##s . This one did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . They were able to accommodate my early check in and my late check out . Room was clean . The Breakfast and evening social were great , with great food and pleasant staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent the last two nights of our US vacation at the Fair ##mont hotel . We took the upgrade to also have the lounge included and it was great . With this addition the hotel actually feels very personal . The staff was very nice and friendly . Good room with a view . All in all very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All of our AD ##A needs were met and exceeded by all the staff and the physical amenities of our suite . Overall every single person associated with the hotel that we had contact with was helpful , friendly , and competent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice place . You get bath ##robe ##s in your room to use if you want to use them . It was ninety degrees plus when we were there . No need to use them . Pet friendly but it would be nice if they knew exactly where to take your pets to do their business . They told us down by Mill ##ini ##mum Park . That was a very long walk in the heat and crowds . Found out later that you could walk two blocks another way and go down by the river ##front park . Breakfast not included . Everything seemed clean . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I stayed here for a weekend get ##away and I was pleasant ##ly surprised at how nice this hotel turned out to be . The location is Amazing , walking distance to the Ma ##g Mile and many attractions . The price was a steal . The compliment ##ary breakfast on each floor was a great addition . the Staff was very re ##sp ##ons ##ive to the few needs we had . The front desk was extremely friendly and helpful . The room was top notch and pretty room ##y . I am keeping this as my go to hotel when visiting Chicago in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice venue - always have a te ##rri ##fic stay . Staff are always friendly and re ##sp ##ons ##ive and there are a ton of them ! If you need something , a H ##ya ##tt staff member is always close by . I am an early bird , so I love the fact that their Market only closes for one hour a day . I love being able to get a good cup of coffee at 4 : 30 ##am ! Te ##rri ##fic location too - so close to Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
0	[CLS] When planning your next visit to the Wind ##y City , choosing the Palmer House Hilton is a M ##US ##T ! The location is convenient to shopping , restaurants , tourists attractions and is a great place to just walk around and check out the buildings ! The a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s of this hotel , from the location , to staff , to room size , and the one - minute from your room to a Star ##bu ##ck ' s makes this a perfect place to stay ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay was great ! The hotel was clean and all of the staff were nice . It was close to anything I wanted to see and when distance was an issue , there was convenient public transportation or a short ride to get there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The view of the lake and park was lovely . The room felt spacious , furniture was contemporary , very functional . . . simple in a way but to me a big time feel . . . lots of good design choices without being trend ##y . . . some hotels try this and it sometimes is distract ##ing . . . the Swiss is more classic and relaxing ! And the staff was great . . . an easy charm that seemed professional and genuine ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I set up a spa experience for my wife and it was wonderful ! I was able to pre pay for a massage and facial treatment . My wife said it was the best massage and experience she had ever had . I would recommend the hotel and spa - the whole experience was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a 3 day conference at this hotel . Excellent service from check ##in to check ##out . The check ##in went out of their way to make the process inform ##ative giving some added benefits . Food was to a high standard , large room recently refurbished . High ##ly recommended [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff was amazing and very friendly . Ke ##enan helped us checked in early to get our se ##lves re ##f ##resh ##ed from the long and super early flight into town . The room had a great view of the river and all the de ##cor was really modern . The entire room was updated and had a very luxurious feel . There were enough outlets and USB ports to plug in all our electronics . Everything was within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love staying at this hotel . Hotel is beautiful . Am ##eni ##ties are great . Location is superb . Love that within a 3 min walk there are stores and coffee shops and restaurants . Service is top notch . I host a large event here every year and hope we never have to move . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We drove from NYC and arrived to find that it would be $ 71 a night to park ! We were exhausted from 14 hours on the road so we did not look elsewhere for parking . Then we find out there is no free internet for our room . Really ? The carpet in the room was g ##narl ##y and I asked for it to be cleaned . Not a great experience . When I come back to visit my son in college I will stay outside the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfectly situated for anything and everything you want to do in Chicago . Steps away from the River ##walk , a block away from the Miracle Mile , close to public transportation and many other walk ##able attractions . The views are stunning , the rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly ! We had a hard time leaving those com ##fy beds for all our planned activities . Perhaps due to co ##vid the mini fridge was not in the room , but one could be brought to the room for a small fee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been to Chicago probably 10 times for work , but this time brought my wife . Our conference was at the hotel and we came in early to enjoy the city . The hotel was in a great location and we really enjoyed it . Very nice rooms and a very friendly staff . Only negative was the elevator system is new and a bit odd , but I ’ m splitting hairs . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , great location , close to all the attractions in the Loop ! Easy to get to , nearby public transportation , no problems parking . Clean spacious room , all the amenities , helpful staff . I will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our Chicago experience was fantastic . It all started at the Intercontinental hotel with Bell ##man Ronald . He was know ##led ##gable , friendly , and helpful . He was an excellent example of customer service , wanting to make sure our room and experience was enjoyable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room and service was great . We really liked this hotel and would stay again . The location is great for walking around Chicago . Sometimes the quality of an organization is reflected in how they handle errors . Vale ##t parking mi ##sla ##id our car key . We used the spare and filled out an insurance report . The facility manager said they would mail us the key or pay to replace it . They also com ##ped us the parking . They found the key thirty minutes later and we re ##cie ##ved the key in the mail within 48 hours . The facility manager gave me his personal cell phone to follow up . One should always bring a spare car key just in case . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the Intercontinental Hotel . The charm and character of the hotel , it ' s perfect location on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and the ex ##em ##p ##lary service , made our stay perfect ! There are so many restaurants and great shopping , all within walking distance . This will definitely be our " go to " hotel when we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love O ##m ##ni hotels , but this one was only so so . The staff was friendly , the hotel was clean , but this isn ' t a 4 or 5 star hotel . The room layout , with the sitting room separate from the bed , just made the sleeping area seem cramped . I just expected more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hotel holds great history and you can sense it as soon as you walk through the front door . The Hotel is in great shape and has been updated to current accommodation ##s that you expect in a new Hotel . Other than the Restaurant being closed during my stay , it was Wonderful . Kitty O ' Shea ##s is great and they have a first class G ##ym / Fitness Center . I highly recommend this Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here at the start of our Route 66 adventure , and what a good place it is . We were greeted by a very friendly v ##alet , who took the car and escorted us to the check in desk . The guy behind the desk was brilliant and upgraded us to the club lounge which was fantastic and I highly recommend . It ’ s great for views of the Chicago river , and the snack ##s drinks and breakfast were great . The rooms were very clean and quiet , I slept well on the very comfortable bed . The location is very close to all the action including the magnificent mile and the t ##ri ##bu ##ne building etc etc , so great for exploring the lovely city of Chicago . I highly recommend this hotel , you won ’ t be disappointed [SEP]
1	[CLS] During our girls weekend in Chicago , we decided to try Ki ##nz ##ie because of it ' s location and price . We are very happy that we have made that decision ! The location is as perfect as it gets ! Co ##up ##le blocks away from Michigan Ave and the river , but yet tucked away on a quiet street . Very easy to get in and out of . Extreme ##ly competitive prices . Vale ##t parking with in and out privileges . Friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , especially the front desk and door ##men ( as an example , when I came back from my morning run , the person at the front desk handed me couple of bottles of water without me asking for it ) . Very clean spacious rooms that seemed to be newly re ##mo ##del ##ed . Happy hour in the evening . Continental breakfast on each floor in the morning . We will definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From front desk check - in , to the bars and lounge ##s , breakfast and dinner in the restaurants , every staff member I came into contact with smiled and made sure my stay was memorable . The customer service training shows ; someone has done a great job with the team in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall great experience . I ' d highly recommend it . We booked through a Kay ##ak option and they forgot to send our reservation through to the hotel . I ' d recommend always confirming with the hotel that everything is set . But that wasn ' t The hotels fault and they were helpful getting the booking agencies mistake corrected . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed for two nights as part of our trip to Chicago to see Hamilton . The hotel was beautiful and the service was wonderful ! We had bid on the package through a charity auction so had no idea what to expect - everything was perfect ! High ##ly recommend and we will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ent 4 - star hotel close the lake and Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile in downtown Chicago . Great location to see Millennium Park , Theater District , Museum Campus , Navy Pier , etc . I ' ve stayed here at least 5 times . Try to see if they ' ll upgrade you to a suite with a view of the lake [SEP]
1	[CLS] Both the security and duty manager were extremely confrontation ##al and rude when I asked to borrow a fork ! ! Dirty bathroom , dated and simply v ##ile . Much better properties to stay at . The only good thing is the location everything else is hideous including the service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the minute I walked into the Hilton Chicago I was treated with respect and what felt like white glove ##d service . The service I received from Julius and Cars ##arra was exceptional . They went over and beyond to make me very comfortable . I would highly recommend this g ##em of a hotel in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I could not fault this hotel for service , friendly staff , imp ##ec ##ca ##ble room and high standard . My second stay in a So ##fit ##el and both of the highest standard . great location close to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and within easy walking distance of a lot of the sights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got to the hotel , line around the corner . Li ##teral ##ly the longest check ##in line I ' ve ever seen , and for those who travel , worse than any hotel in Vegas . Amazing that they didn ' t care at all . . they have a sign about " making it right " , what a joke . And then I wake up early to do some work and there is no coffee in the room and no room service until 5 : 30 , hate this place . Find somewhere else to stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was a bit small , but everything was clean , staff was friendly and it was a perfect location to see all the beautiful sites of Chicago . The door ##men were f ##abulous - so helpful and friendly . Michael Jordan ##s Restaurant was f ##abulous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean room , great room view of city , restaurant on main level had great customer service Co ##mp ##lain ##t : No fridge in room ( fridge provided was extra $ $ and very small ) ; Micro ##wave ##s are only on main level for use ; Un ##com ##fort ##able beds [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was really impressed with Swiss ##ote ##l . Was there with a large group for a wedding . Service was just perfect . I was the best man for a wedding and both wedding parties were upgraded to a suite for the night before the wedding . Price ##s were just really great for a high - rise hotel right on the ch ##ica ##go river . My king room was also simply very nice with gorgeous views of either the lake or the ch ##ica ##go river no matter which side of the hotel you ' re on . I would very highly recommend this hotel . ( as a minor side note , the Palm restaurant that is on the ground level was the least impressive Palm that i ' ve ever been to , but that shouldn ' t de ##tract from the hotel quality ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for work and expected a double room but had a twin . The de ##cor and fitting ##s were tired and some windows mist ##ed so it felt a bit din ##gy . Bar is attached to the restaurant and s ##mel ##t very strongly on fish , once so much that I went for a drink elsewhere . Chicago is fantastic though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I actually booked four hotels for my stay . The first one closed due to re ##nn ##ova ##tions . That hotel s ##w ##tic ##hed me to their sister hotel . I did not like the location so I cancelled and booked a hotel one block from they H ##ya ##tt and later received and email that their rest ##ura ##nt was closed . I looked around and found the H ##ya ##tt which is in a great location , It ' s very clean , one re ##su ##tra ##nt and bar were open and had a very tasting limited menu and del ##ish drinks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a Hilton Honors Gold member My colleagues are not Hilton honors members at all Interest ##ingly enough , I checked in first and requested a paid upgrade to a corner suite and was told they were sold out . Then my colleague checked in and was offered the upgrade to the suite I had requested for and additional $ 25 . 00 per night So much for Hilton loyalty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 4 nights in Chicago . First time in Chicago ! Best Pizza Pie ##s ! Great Hotel ! Great Location ! Anything I needed at any time Gustavo knows where to eat ! High ##ly recommended . Michael Jordan ##s is in Lo ##bby ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great place to stay . Great location and beautiful views . The rooms were clean , beds were comfortable and the service was excellent . Only downfall was true incredibly flat down pillows . After the second night I was able to obtain the foam pillows that were not that much better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel situated just north of the river in a nice area with tons of restaurants . About a 6 minute walk to the closest loop station . Double shower head was nice . As was the 5 ##pm reception on the top floor ( apps and drinks ) , hotel also has a continental breakfast . Only s ##na ##g : be ##ware of a $ 15 / night “ service fee ” . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##orm ##ous property in great location right on the river , some rooms facing the lake . We enjoyed the room ' s view but the size was quite small . Service excellent . Sin ##k problem addressed by engineering with success and consideration . Breakfast b ##uff ##et one of the better ones I ' ve seen at this price ( about $ 26 ) . Re ##com ##men ##ded for a downtown / Michigan Ave . stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel . Location is great for ma ##g mile and rush s ##t . Nice outdoor patio couch ##es and chairs for drinks , app ##eti ##zers or just people watching . Staff is at ##ten ##tive . Nice gym . Have stayed here more than once and will again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room we stayed in was in poor condition for a four star hotel . While the lobby and library / lounge are truly lovely , the room did not feel like it was part of the same hotel . We really enjoyed The P ##ump Room restaurant , but would not recommend the hotel , only because of the condition of the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall a great hotel in a great location just off Michigan avenue and rush street . Very safe environment for women traveling alone . Had some concerns about bathroom clean ##liness . Other than that a great place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just stayed one night for nearby meeting and overall the room was very good . Spa ##cious with nice clean bathroom and a room safe . Love ##d the soap and s ##ham ##po ##o di ##sp ##ens ##ing bottles vs the di ##sp ##osa ##ble tiny bottles that end up in land ##fill or worse . Only 2 things I noticed that made my sleep less than perfect . There was a a must ##y smell on the wall with the window , which was very noticeable when sleeping on the side closest to the window . I could not find any signs of leaking or water damage , so it might be behind the wall . The other thing was the constant outdoor fan noise coming from the 4th floor roof of the structure under my window . I was on the 7th floor so I can ' t imagine how much louder it gets for the lower floors . Other than that , great location and nice looking property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E ! ! Great location , amazing & at ##ten ##tive staff , close to Michigan Ave , and loads of restaurants and more . Just perfect ! ! The beds are to die for , linen ##s were heavenly , it was the best weekend ever ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the inter ##continent ##al with 2 more families . It was clean and peaceful as always . Miss ##ed not being able to have the standard b ##uff ##et breakfast downstairs as that used to be the fun part for all the kids every morning but they have us Star ##bu ##cks credit at check ##in to use for grab and go throughout our stay which was pretty convenient . We love this hotel because it ’ s central and you can walk all around downtown easily . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my third stay at this property and will continue to use it as my home base when back in Chicago . The location is perfect - close to Red Line el and Michigan Ave - and the rooms are wonderful with a full kitchen . I didn ' t take advantage of the breakfast and happy hour amenities , but they seemed to be pretty popular . I stayed in a corner suite on the 13th floor and had nice city views and sunlight . The elevators were a bit crowded , but they came relatively quickly . There ' s a Jewel ( grocery store ) right around the corner , which is nice to pick up a few ne ##cess ##ities for your stay . Overall , a great hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I went there for work . I did enjoy the food choice there . They have ve ##gan menu choices which is great ! The rooms are spacious and com ##fy . The bathroom could benefit of an upgrade . They are modern but the amenities they offer could be expand . The cotton patches are very small . Some hotels offer make up removal patches but not here while they organise ##s a lot of conferences and many business travelers are now women . Can be a nice add - on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is the very best I have found in hotel stays . My 4 nights in Chicago , although it was chill ##y outside , the hotel was warm and superb , from the welcoming door ladies to every employee I encountered throughout my stay . No detail was missed , each person I spoke with on the phone , in person and by text , just the very best . The room , dining in Baptiste & the Bo ##ttle , coffee at Il Ta ##vo ##lino , the front desk and room service , all extremely impressive . My stay felt like being with family , a very kind and caring family . I am an employee of the Hilton Corporation and therefore have the privilege of staying at many of our hotels at employee rates . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for our anniversary . The services from the con ##cier ##ge desk ( Alexandria and Gerry ) was superb . They upgraded us to a suite with an amazing view and even gave us a complementary bottle of wine . And the rate was very reasonable for a Saturday night stay in the city . T ##ruly a first class experience ! ! ! We will be back again soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you , like I , try to be loyal to the Hilton brand on business travel due to a ##cc ##um ##ulating points think twice before booking here ! The hotel is incredibly tired . Dec ##or is dated , walls are so thin that you can hear people in the next room going to the toilet , chatting about where to go for dinner etc ! Room ##s very dusty and bathroom ##s g ##rot ##ty . I asked to be moved twice and all rooms seem to be the same , in desperate need of renovation . Both times I visited the front desk there were people complaining their rooms were not ready , despite it being 8 ##pm or later ! ! A ##vo ##id at all costs I ’ m afraid , photos of my room included ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at The Talbot ##t for a recent get ##away to Chicago and thought the location was fantastic , you are close to a lot of different attractions but outside of the immediate downtown bust ##le . I have to say that I was expecting a little more fancy amenities than we got but our room was beautiful and the staff was very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is amazing . Location is perfect for theater or shopping or rail system . There is a bar across the street with many craft beers . Room ##s are beautifully maintained and very contemporary . The staff is amazing - - everyone is friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##elle ##nt location rooms lovely service imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . 5 star plus would strongly recommend a stay hear a high ##t floor for better views . Every thing on your door step great location straight on to the magnificent mile shops all around you [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon we arrival the man in the front of lobby very helpful , after checking with front desk they able to let us to get a connected room since we are going with a group of friend , We had a nice view and the staff very helpful through out the entitled time we were there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A real " home from home " . St ##ren ##gth ##s : friend ##liness and helpful ##ness of staff , location , V ##G breakfast ##s every day and manager ' s social ##s Mon . to T ##hur ##s . - big saving in money and time , clean ##liness of apartment . We ##ak ##ness ##es - not very serious ! - small ##ish swimming pool , no door linking living room to bathroom so sometimes disturbance to occupants of bedroom during night , only 1 mirror . But essentially 10 out of 10 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is one of the nice ##st hotels I ' ve ever stayed in . i especially enjoyed the view . I ' m from South Texas , so to wake up on the tenth floor to the view of sky ##scraper ##s was fun . The room was a suite , with a very comfortable bed . The service was great . We also enjoyed the breakfast b ##uff ##et . I t was fun and convenient to be in downtown Chicago , in the center of things . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a wonderful time in Chicago this past weekend . The Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal is a beautiful , historic hotel that provides modern amenities . All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful . We look forward to our next visit . The location along the magnificent mile is great for shopping or just seeing the sites . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful , big hotel in the middle of downtown . Bed comfortable . Problems in room fixed quickly . I did have a package sent to me in the hotel which never turned up . The con ##cier ##ge was contacted 4 times by send ##er but package was never found . Del ##iver ##y was acknowledged . Maybe they need to sharp ##en up things in the service area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a great experience . The overall service was amazing . The con ##cier ##ge Morgan went way beyond to make this trip perfect ! I would not hesitate to stay here again . Our favorite place yet in Chicago . Don ’ t forget to try the restaurant [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my second stay at this new hotel and I ' m so happy to be back ! I love the food , I love the whiskey , I love the view . Be sure to book room corner room 160 ##8 if it ' s available - the windows on both sides make for it special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Hotel in the middle of Everything , Great Room ##s , ( I had a suite ) , it was one of the best views of the city , I have ever had , Great , Great , Great . Walking Distance to Great Restaurant ##s and Shopping . Evening Re ##ception with Free , yes I said Free Wine was Great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were a family of 5 staying in Chicago over Christmas for a family wedding . Everything about this hotel was impressive from the at ##ten ##tive , polite staff to the fantastic breakfast to the wonderful pool . Best of all though was the room . If you get a chance book the two bed suite on the 40th floor , 360 degree views of the City and loads of space . Not to be missed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has spacious suites , great location and welcoming and kind staff . The rooms were well appointed , clean and maintained . What a great location in Chicago whether you are on a business trip or vacation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Angelina was most helpful when I realized I left my laptop in my room and I was already at Midway . She immediately took it down to the UP ##S store who called and had it box ##ed and shipped for me . I received my computer the next day with virtually no down time . Thanks again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great time , hotel was in the heart of Michigan Ave . Room were clean , comfortable and the view was great ! Had room service one night and it was A ##wes ##ome . We would define ##lt ##y stay again at this hotel ! We were in t ##O ##wn for the cu ##bs convention and it was easy access to the She ##rato ##n ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ##not say enough good things about the customer service provided after a difficult day and problems with my rental car . Travis reassuring ##ly stepped in and helped solve every problem for me . Wen ##t above and beyond , including offering wine and an upgrade ! I truly felt taken care of and was so app ##re ##cia ##tive that I wasn ' t at a big chain hotel being treated like a number and a bother . Our room was great too , comfortable and taste ##ful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at a number of Kim ##pton ##s over the years but this one was disappointing . Be ##gan at check - in when the desk clerk swore I had a pre ##pa ##id room th ##ru Price ##line . Note to management I ' ve never use Price ##line . When I offered the to show the clerk my confirmation email from the hotel itself she didn ' t want to be bothered ! Also had a recurring issue with the room key not working . Got to the point where a " engineer " tried to fix the door lock and when he couldn ' t simply apologized . Bit of a has ##sle having to go constantly to front desk to be re - key ##ed . Many choices in Chicago . . . will stay elsewhere my next trip in the fall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed in this hotel several times over the years , as the location is good and the rooms have a nice view of the lake . This time my room was showing its age , it needs a renovation . It was however clean and spacious , with a firm , comfortable bed . The main negative was a constant humming noise from the air conditioning , even when this was off . I had to sleep with ear plug ##s because of it . Also , the shower is old fashioned and water spill ##s all over . Service is good , I asked for a few things from house ##keeping and they were delivered promptly . The room was cleaned properly every day and room service was fast ( although they got my order wrong and the food was not great ) . Overall this is a convenient place to stay for business . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk and front door service excellent . Willie at the front is exceptionally knowledge ##able . Michael Jordan St ##eak ##house was a surprising delicious a ##b ##c service was persona ##ble and knowledge ##able . We recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location with wonderful views of the river and downtown . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located and while I was a little taken a ##back by the size of the doorway / entry ##way to the room , the room itself ( a King ) was well app ##ort ##ioned for a single person . The staff were extremely nice and helpful and ho ##nes ##lt ##y seemed to care . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are in extreme need of renovation . T ##hic ##k coat of dust above door frames , doors to bathroom ##s were dirty , cleaning people were eating in the hallway . Pa ##id way to much for a room / environment in this condition . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here to attend a conference in their convention space . The staff were friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , even during a rush of check - ins and outs . The hotel is large and many large groups stayed there . The rooms are clean and well maintained , but the hotel could use a re ##f ##resh . The gym facilities are good for a hotel . No late night room service and their restaurants close at various times . The location is okay . Close to Michigan Ave toward the south end of miracle mile , thus you have to walk a few blocks to get to the heart of shopping or to millennium park . It is located right next to the newer Lo ##ew ' s hotel . I would stay here again when it ' s convenient to my activities or I got a great rate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco staff was the best part of our stay in Chicago . They made us feel so welcome and were very helpful . The room was comfortable and clean and we loved that each room came with a good size umbrella for us to use on those rainy days . The location was perfect and convenient to Millennium Park , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and Theatre ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Re - review after experiencing several hi ##cc ##ups during stay when it first opened . Room was luxurious outfit ##ted ( both standard room & suite ) and comfortable , with automated black ##out curtains a particularly nice touch . Location is perfect being on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Only negative was that No ##yan ##e on rooftop was under ##sta ##ffed , leading to unclear ##ed tables , sticky menu ##s , and a long wait for service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] American girl doll package was fantastic ! The food v ##ou ##chers and parking were a nice added value . Hotel room was beautiful . I have stayed at an O ##m ##ni in Charlotte as well as Chicago and would continue to stay at O ##m ##ni Hotels when able to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My spouse and I stayed Feb . 3 - 4 , 2018 just one night but it was a wonderful , calming stay . Staff was warm , welcoming and very professional . It was a snow ##y winter day / evening and great to return to the hotel after shopping to a co ##zy room . Turn - down service was te ##rri ##fic and included a surprise treat for my husband ' s birthday . Large bathroom has both deep soaking tub for those who like baths and room ##y shower ; flu ##ffy bath ##robe ##s included ( slip ##pers , too ) . Location of this So ##fit ##el is very convenient - just off of Chicago ' s Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . We don ' t drink but the bar area looked lively and had dinner / breakfast plans elsewhere , so cannot comment on the hotel cafe . An excellent value , all things considered . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago during a conference . The location of the hotel was very good . I asked for a room with a river view , and the front desk was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . The hotel was walking distance to the Michigan Ave . the magnificent mile and many restaurants . The room was comfortable and clean but nothing extra ordinary about it , considering the high rate for the reservation ( rates always increase for this major annual meeting ) I probably will stay here again for next year ' s annual AS ##CO conference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was way too big for what I needed however I wasn ##t complaining as t ##ge v ##ir ##w from the 41st floor was very good Only stayed one night but got a go ##id night sleep after a night on the town My only criticism is the long wait to check in I think they need to review the number of staff they have available when the first check in time is available Didn ##t eat in the hotel but the menu looked good enough [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was very modern , clean , and had many amenities including cook ##ware , dish ##wash ##er and stove . We stayed on the 19th floor which had a beautiful view . The pool was small and there was no hot ##tub but it was a well up ##ke ##pt . The hotel is within 10 minute walk of many hot ##sp ##ots including good food and shopping . The breakfast was good except the powder ##ed eggs and similar offerings every morning which became tires ##ome by the 4th morning . Staff were great and v ##alet was quick . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From check - in to check - out the Intercontinental was excellent . Friendly , helpful staff provide a great stay experience . The room was clean . Love ##d having a Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel and the well - stacked bar at Michael Jordan ' s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d this place for the location , especially for the outside dining available Riverside , under the shade of trees and table umbrella ##s . Friendly staff , but service was lacking in a couple aspects . I would still go again just because I love being in a nice hotel , waters ##ide . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is awesome ! So high class . All the workers work there are so professional and polite and knowledge ##able . Everything they do says high class . From the rooms , sheets , de ##cor ##s , staff uniforms , even the public bathroom ##s are breath taking . The paper towels are nice and thick . Over all , a great hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton style hotel with well appointed rooms and q ##ui ##rky details , like a j ##agu ##ar bath robe and a fish ##bow ##l with live gold ##fish on request . Died a few days later . Nice river view , though . E ##ff ##icient staff and evening wine hour , a Kim ##pton tradition . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a conference at the O ##m ##ni . Everyone knows about the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and all the wonderful shops in The Loop and it is in a prime area . I stayed on the 18th floor but unfortunately I didn ' t have a great view . If you want a room with a view I would avoid staying in room 1804 . It ' s in the corner but your only view is another building . The amenities are great and the room was nice . I heard my neighbors having a conversation early in the morning . I ' m thankful that I was already up because I could clearly hear them talking about something . For a hotel that isn ' t cheap I shouldn ' t have been able to hear a conversation being had in another room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at O ##m ##ni with children while we were downtown for soccer all star game . Lo ##action was perfect and size of the room is what sold me on O ##m ##ni ! I have older children and we were all able to stay in suite room . Great night stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed at this location countless times and never have they failed to impress . Very clean rooms and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting Hotel staff location location location is Key and this is right there amongst everything you need . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family of four stayed here for two nights . When we initially checked in , we were given a room that faced a wall but the front desk was able to switch us to a street facing room several floors up which was far better . The highlights of this hotel are : ( 1 ) wonderful staff who proved to be very at ##ten ##tive , friendly , and helpful , ( 2 ) location within walking distance to everything , and ( 3 ) amazing restaurant / side walk cafe where we enjoyed two breakfast ##s and a very memorable dinner . Our entire family was sad to leave this wonderful hotel and we look forward to coming back soon . [SEP]
0	[CLS] O ##m ##ni has certainly gained our respect after staying with another major chain for years . We stayed at the O ##m ##ni in downtown Chicago for a quick one night before our flight . The service level at O ##m ##ni is simply top notch . Extreme ##ly clean hotel , com ##fy beds , great view , and ex ##ped ##ited service . Well done O ##m ##ni ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been coming to the Palmer House for many years and as a Hilton Gold member there is no question it is a great place . However on my last visit I was first assigned a room with a broken door that did not close properly . At my request they gave me a different room , but as a Hilton property why would a room be in service with a broken and badly damaged door ? In the new room the shower did not drain properly and there were no hand towels or coffee machine , even though it was described as an upgrade on the 17th floor . This hotel remains a standard in Chicago but this experience makes me wonder if they are starting to lose their grip on being the classic “ go to ” hotel for which it has been known . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is such a unique history filled hotel and I always look forward to returning . The rooms are beautiful and vintage styled . The hallway ##s are a bit confusing but you will be me ##sm ##eri ##zed by the photos of the vintage music legends lining your walk . My biggest complaint is that it is starting to show its age . I never want to see the wall ##paper p ##eel ##ing in the halls . The club lounge is a big let down - its huge but so ##o crowded and poorly maintained so it is not worth that up ##cha ##rge . Big thumbs up for the beautiful bathroom ##s and the fitness center is a leg ##it gym ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at this hotel twice - once in July 2016 and again December 2018 . The location can ’ t be beat ! It ’ s on the trolley route so we were able to easily get to the museums , Navy Pier and other attractions . It ’ s also very walk ##able to the beautiful nearby parks . The lobby is gorgeous with so much going on ! We ate breakfast at the b ##uff ##et which was amazing ! The room itself is spacious , modern and clean . The hotel staff is also helpful and court ##eous . They have a nice indoor pool and hot tub ##s , as well as an indoor track and fitness center . I ’ m planning another trip soon and for me , this is the only place I want to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s great that there is the underground shopping and dining , but ask for a map since it is easy to get lost . Great hotel and friendly staff but I wasn ' t to excited about the U ##ber designated pick up location . Be sure to keep your room key because you have to cross towers to have u ##ber retrieve you and early morning the elevators are locked and there is no one in the sky ##walk or around on the second floor and when the wind chill is 9 , no one wants to walk outside before they have to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose to stay here when we got theater tickets . The location is ideal for the theater district - - but then , there was so much more . We were charm ##ed by the re ##fine ##ment of the historic hotel , the imp ##ec ##ca ##bly maintained old - world interior , top - notch staff , and large room with two bathroom ##s . The price was extremely reasonable , especially for two beds and two well - appointed bathroom ##s . There was nothing we found that could be improved . It was easy to walk to the parks , shopping , and the theater . We will definitely travel back to Chicago and stay at the Palmer House a Hilton Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had fun . Weather was spectacular ! Good Location . Up ##grade to Gold level was well worth it ! WA ##L ##KE ##D E ##VE ##R ##Y ##W ##H ##ER ##E ! Too ##k advantage of Breakfast , snack ##s and happy hour , and even times not listed . It was so ##o worth it ! I would recommend to friends ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel with interesting history . Check ##in staff was very helpful . Marcus was the best ! ! Had friendly , helpful staff by doors / elevators to help you go in the right directions . Bell ##men were also great ! So no issues with staff . The reason for 3 stars is because the hotel nickel and dim ##es you after paying over $ 250 per night . They charge you to work ##out in fitness center ( $ 15 / day ) . That ’ s outrage ##ous ! ! Also , I waited over 40 min to get front desk staff on phone . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton is always a good choice for this part of downtown . A real good mix of history with all of the updated services one would expect . This hotel works for either business or pleasure and has a nice mix of amenities for both . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed the hotel . We arrived on a red eye and they let us in the room early . Great c ##ri ##b too for our baby . Stay here if you have a baby ! Free w ##if ##i too . Clean room . We reserved on hot ##wire and they still treated us rely well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall a very good hotel with staff at ##ten ##tive to details . Room ##s are slightly dated ; however they are spacious , clean and comfortable . The beds are excellent and the hotel gym is well set up and spacious for travelers des ##iring a good hotel gym . I was part of a large conference group , so our breakfast , lunch and dinner ##s were all within the hotel and for the meals I attended , they were all very high quality , well prepared , creative and taste ##ful .

0	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel has a stop over and did not think we were going to a great hotel like this the staff go the extra mile to make sure your stay is is great my brother is in a wheelchair and staff stop what they were doing to help him out who is thinking about going here i would [SEP]
0	[CLS] Just checked into Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago . Ben V ##i was such a great help anti ##ci ##pating my questions and providing con ##cise and useful information about the hotel and its services . Seeing the lake from the pan ##ora ##mic views of my upgraded suite was an awesome surprise ! ! ! Thanks Ben ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] First time staying at this hotel in Chicago and I loved it . The staff was very friendly and helpful , the front desk filled you in on everything you needed to know and the room was beautiful and relaxing . Location was ideal as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] good front desk service , fast elevators , good gym , good location . good ass ##ort ##ment of toilet ##ries and hair dry ##er . Good view from the 35th floor . Within walking distance to many restaurants and businesses . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was surprised how un ##we ##l ##coming the staff were , from the second we checked in . They weren ' t friendly upon check ##out either . The only nice people were the maid ##s I encountered in the hall . One of the two elevators was being worked on , and with a room on the 17th floor , walking wasn ' t an option . Had to wait about 5 - 8 minutes each time . The rooms are T ##IN ##Y . The bathroom is one of the smallest I ' ve ever seen . Even the sinks are so small you can ' t wash your face without touching the sink . Gross . The bed was comfortable , and we did not hear neighbors , street sounds or hall sounds . This is a historic building , which is very pretty . The lobby is gorgeous . The location is f ##abulous . I will not stay here again , however , due to the rooms and staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I traveled to the Chicago marathon with my family . The Fair ##mont provided the great experience I have come to expect from their hotels . Large room , nice amenities , god location and wonderful service . We had a gorgeous view of the lake , museums and Grant and Millennium Parks where the race was held . The hotel acknowledged the runners with water and banana ##s and early breakfast options , something I have not found at other hotels when I ’ ve traveled for races . We were very happy with our choice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##abulous location ! Close enough to easily walk to ##M ##uchi ##gan Ave . , but quiet and away from more tourist ##y areas . Room was incredible quiet , bright and air ##y . Nice sheets and towels . Downs ##ide . . . while hotel was renovated , shower / tub was incredible awkward to climb into . 2 tiny elevators are in desperate need of new carpet and face ##lift . No coffee maker in room . Coffee bar downstairs was very slow . So - so la ##tt ##te for $ 6 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have had a wonderful stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago . First of all it is located adjacent to the beautiful river ##walk . Second the service we have received has been excellent . We had some difficulty with our card keys ( it took 8 keys to get it right ) In the process we met Allie Gay ##le a manager at the hotel . She re ##med ##ied the problem and looked after us thereafter including a special treat in our room one evening ( chocolate covered chocolate ##s and a beverage ) . We highly recommend this hotel . The only draw ##back is the $ 55 . 00 per day to park the car . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic location and great views of the River ##way / Navy Pier from my room . Room ##s were spacious and well kept . Couldn ’ t have been happier . The Palm was in the hotel as well which made for great all around experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ( husband , daughter and I ) have stayed at the O ##m ##ni twice this year and have been very happy with each stay . The staff is awesome . So ##fin ##at at the con ##cier ##ge desk on the 1st floor , was so nice and helped us with everything almost before we asked ! In January we were going to a concert for my daughter ' s birthday and we happen to tell the front desk what we were doing and we came back to the room after the concert to find a small cake for her : ) This time we got a free upgrade to a very spacious corner room which had great views . The beds are sin ##fully comfortable . The pull out bed is really comfortable - my daughter ( 5 ' 6 " ) loves it . The hotel is very reasonable for the room ' s amenities , location and great service . I also didn ' t hear my neighbors at all . I highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small ##er bout ##ique hotel right off the River . Very nice staff . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary happy hour every evening , I arrived just after and they were nice enough to give me $ 10 off at the restaurant , without even asking . Would definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay . The staff was very kind and our room was nice . Our bathroom could have used a bit more attention but overall the room was clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable . Re ##com ##men ##d [SEP]
0	[CLS] Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary prose ##cco hour is amazing per ##k ! Such a great way to come home from a long work day or travel day . The staff are also so welcoming and enjoyable . I will be staying here every time I come to ch ##ica ##go from now on ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Super cute hotel w / great window seats facing the river . I ##m a fan of the little extra ##s Kim ##pton Hotels give their members . The only down ##side of this hotel or any hotel in the city is parking . The meters run 24 / 7 which is even worse than New York where you can usually park for free after 7 ##PM . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Home ##wood Suite ##s on Grand Avenue was the ideal hotel for a long weekend stay for my brother , me and our wives . It was fairly priced , the rooms were 2 room suites , there was no wasted space in the rooms , breakfast was managed very well by an adequate number of staff , the front desk staff were helpful and the surrounding area was un ##beat ##able with Nord ##strom ' s across the street , j ##oe ' s C ##rab down the street , Eat ##aly behind the hotel to the north and Pizza ##ria Un ##o a short block to the NW and the Red Line subway station 1 block west on Grand . This hotel has a lot going for it at a fair price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was perfect , the staff is enjoyable , the room was beautiful . Hotel is well located close to commuter ##s and restaurants . Many attraction is near too . I really enjoyed the groove of the city and the area ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love everything about this - location near theater district and shopping , the art de ##co de ##cor that honors the building ' s history , the first rate service , the free prose ##cco at happy hour and the Kim ##pton ##s Re ##ward ##s bonus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I got this selection from another search engine and thought b ##um ##mer , and then we stayed there ! O ##MG I loved it ! Location was perfect ! Wine hour , um ##m Y ##ES please ! The rooms were clean , temperature was perfect and to be honest I ' d love to stay here again ! ! Staff were helpful and on point , from the luggage drop to recommendations for food and things to do ! ! They were the best ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Big room , big bathroom , clean , great view , great location , awesome staff . El ##eva ##tor system is so efficient - big hotel but no waiting for the elevators . Hotel is close to everything , but not so close that you get all of the noise from the loop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at a dozen downtown Chicago hotels over the past 25 years and the Conrad is now at the top of my list for style , service , comfort , and location . I can easily walk to the Me ##rch ##and ##ise Mart , Symphony Hall , or the shops and restaurants along Michigan Avenue . At ##ten ##tive service for Hilton Honors members as well ! Love the spacious bathroom ##s and walk in shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were very happy here ! The staff was very helpful and friendly , the room was spot ##less , beds and pillows were com ##fy , and the hotel is in a f ##abulous location on the magnificent mile ! I came with 3 teen girls to shop for a weekend and they were all impressed as well . The work ##out facilities are great too ! We will be back for sure ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] For a $ 300 a night hotel in Chicago the millennium is a bit over priced in my view . Is in need of a re ##fu ##rb . Li ##fts are slow and room very small . On the positive there was nothing really wrong and was clean . Just no W ##OW factor . New rooms would be very welcome . location was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After a bit of a lengthy check in we got nice rooms , maybe an upgrade . Each room had 2 full bathroom ##s , which was perfect as we had 2 ladies in each room . The beds were comfortable and the linen ##s were nice . The bell captain helped us get cab ##s . We were disappointed that the pool and hot tub were closed for annual maintenance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , styling and comfort in lobby and other public spaces . Very nice staff . Yoga mat in room was a nice touch , but yoga channel was terrible . I don ' t mind the co ##zy room , had everything I needed but the bed was stiff and only had a semi thick sheet no blanket , i had a hard time sleeping in 5 degree Chicago weather . Walls very thin could hear everything around me . Also if you forget ad ##vil and your all ##ergic to t ##yle ##no ##l they can ' t help you , that ##s what I was told . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I travel a lot for work and this was the best hotel I ’ ve ever stayed in . I had a long list of room request and they met every single one . My room was beautiful and very clean . The staff were friendly and efficient . I will come back to this hotel when I travel for pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent staff and close to everything downtown . When our flight was cancelled after we had checked out , they accommodate ##d us by giving us our room back to stay until it was time to leave for later flight . Wen ##t out of their way to help us . Q [SEP]
1	[CLS] The first room we were assigned ( at 350 dollars per night ) was a ho ##vel . Cody thankful ##ly moved us to a much more decent room , which was similar to a Mar ##riot ##t Court ##yard room . i think the Fair ##mont brand is severely diminished by being associated with this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a fantastic location . The rooms were well equipped and the beds were extremely comfortable . Unfortunately , each item we bought from the hotel , such as a bottle of water from the bar and a bowl of breakfast cereal , were extremely expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##ti ##re experience was very positive with rooms , service , friendly staff , excellent food . Perfect ##ly located in the center of where everything is happening in Chicago . Con ##cier ##ge team also helpful in assisting with restaurants and activities [SEP]
0	[CLS] Room ' s are clean and neat great value . Had 3 bad experience with the hotel staff . I felt like i was paying for a super 8 and in ##ex ##per ##ienced un ##p ##ro ##fe ##ssion ##al college kids to tell me i wasn ' t good enough to stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love this hotel ! I stay here every time I come to Chicago . The location is excellent , food is really good and those beds are like sleeping on a cloud ! But it really is the service and staff at this hotel that sets it apart . It feels like home away from home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , clean , kind staff , excellent location ! The only downfall is it a bit basic in the room and de ##cor for something that often costs over $ 250 / night ! The other thing I did find f ##rust ##rating is you can hear a lot of noise from the hall , including the cleaning staff who decided to vacuum at 10 ##pm while I was trying to get a to ##ddler to fall asleep in a new place [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful comfortable rooms . Great w ##if ##i . Service was excellent and un ##ob ##tr ##usive . Will definitely make this our go - to hotel in Chicago . Love ##d it . However , if you like room service be aware that options are limited . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only good things to say about our stay ! Great location near great bars , jazz clubs , short walk to Michigan Ave . Love ##d the night ##ly happy hour . Room and amenities were awesome and staff were always friendly , greeting us every ##time we returned . And on top of all that . . . great price ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great people and location . The front desk night crew ( Ra ##ul & Je ##mel ) are great guys and very helpful . Rico ##do & Ms . Pet ##ya made sure we had everything we needed for the room . The young man and lady waiting on us for the morning breakfast and evening reception could not have been nice ##r to us . I have read one review that stated there was a $ 25 charge on there bill for amenities . My bill only had room rate , state tax and city tax . Plus we had a " wedding group rate " , ye ##aa ##aa ! This is now our go to Hotel for Chicago ! Thanks from South Louisiana ! ! ! GO ##D , Guns & G ##um ##bo , R ##J ##C PS . Pet Friendly [SEP]
1	[CLS] The old air condition ##ers kept both myself and the rest of my business associates awake all night long . . . . the hotel is a bit beat and not at all what we expected . . . . . If you need sleep this is not the hotel for you . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is descent located in a nice neighborhood with plenty of food choices within walking distance . The rooms are kind of small but the bathroom is what kind led me to the review . Not only is it very small it has a toilet you would find at a truck stop . One you have to flush with your foot . Total turn off since I didn ’ t want to use my house shoe each time to flush . The staff was very nice the rooms could use a little up ##dating not a bad stay the beds where on a platform that sat low to the floor didn ’ t sleep that well . I probably wouldn ’ t stay again especially because of the bathroom and the platform beds [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el Chicago had the flavor and de ##cor ##um of any top rated international hotel . The experience staff was highly skilled and professional on all aspects of hi hospitality . Hi highly recommend this hotel for luxury , and convenience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for business and a fantastic hotel . Great staff , very helpful , rooms very comfortable , good choice of breakfast ##s and right in the heart of shopping and restaurants . No request was too much and even though they don ’ t have a business centre they helped with any request I had swiftly and helpful ##ly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here after attending the Chicago auto show . We had never stayed in a Kim ##pton Hotel before , but would definitely book here again . The hotel All ##egro was very nice with very persona ##ble employees from the door ##men to the front desk and beyond ! Our king room was very nice and comfortable . The rooms are not large , but remember this is a very old building . I loved the de ##cor of the room including the bathroom . The shower pressure was great , which is a big deal to me , and plenty of hot water ( we were on the 7th floor ) . Check - in and check - out went very smooth and the front desk team were very persona ##ble . The " living ##room " is a nice area along with a full bar right there . Everything was clean and we ' ll taken care of . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in the Swiss ##ote ##l for two nights in May for business . It ' s a first - rate hotel with a lovely and well - trained staff . I was fortunate enough to be in a suite . I found the rooms clean and comfortable . Bed ##s are also first rate . It ' s well situated on East W ##ack ##er , near many restaurant options . The Palm restaurant is on premise at the hotel , a great option for dinner if you don ' t want to leave the hotel . I believe this is the only Swiss ##ote ##l in the U . S . , unfortunate since it ' s such a nice hotel group . [SEP]
1	[CLS] R ##ott ##ing food was left in the mini fridge from previous guests . Water was coming from the light fixture in the bathroom . The gym is not included with the stay , $ 15 / day on top of insane ##ly high room rates . Check out other hotels in the area if you want to stay by the lake . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Staff was excellent ! Especially Do ##y ! He gave my family and I a history lesson about this fascinating hotel ! It ’ s beautiful and you feel like you ’ ve stepped back in time ! Would highly recommend and will be staying here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I don ' t fault the hotel . They are going for a particular type of travel ##er and I am not that travel ##er . As a frequent business travel ##er , I don ' t need a hotel with dog bowls of food and water in the lobby . I would rather have a w ##if ##i connection that is easy to get to ( not here ) . I don ' t need a yoga mat in my room , but I would like to have a coffee pot ( not here ) . I don ' t need a leopard print bath robe , but I would like a room with a fairly new bathroom ( not here , the p ##lating was worn off the tub fixtures ) . So I get it . They are going for the " hip " mill ##ennial crowd ( people traveling with their dog , doing yoga in their hotel room , ad sitting around in a bath robe ) . Good for them . But now that I know that , I will choose another hotel that is more geared to the business travel ##er . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We did not get to experience the full hotel since the lobby and restaurants were closed due to the pan ##de ##mic . The layout of the one bedroom suite was excellent and the sofa bed was useful . Great location , loved having Star ##bu ##cks across the street . The room was quiet ##er than I expected it to be based on previous reviews . The only thing keeping me from a 5 bubble / 5 star review is that the room seemed somewhat din ##gy and the bed ##ding didn ' t fit the bed great , but it was fine . The most positive part of the stay was the pleasant staff who handled everything very nicely during the pan ##de ##mic . All of the staff should be commended for their efforts , thank you and stay safe ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location to everything needed ! Love ##ly hotel ! People so friendly and helpful . . de ##cor for Christmas is sparkling . . a destination place for sure ! Michael Jordan ' s restaurant a plus ! The exterior lighting is spectacular ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I very much enjoyed my stay at the Talbot ##t . I was surprised how nice it was for the price I paid . The mini bar was totally stock ##ed with b ##oo ##ze and fun snack ##s . The room was perfect size , super clean and very s ##ty ##lish . The bathroom was fully stock ##ed with Jonathan Al ##der soap ##s which smelled amazing . They seemed to have a really nice restaurant on the first floor . My trip was just so quick I already had plans to meet friends else where , I didn ' t get the opportunity to give it a shot . Finally , the area around the hotel has some fantastic mid to high end shopping . Great neighborhood . I would happily stay at the Talbot ##t the next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room not as pictured on website . Pictures show chair / o ##tto ##man or set ##tee , large van ##ity in bathroom . We had one little desk chair , one very small van ##ity in bathroom . Was in executive level king . T ##IN ##Y room . Don ' t bother paying for executive lounge . Te ##rrible ! The evening ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres - chicken wings ( okay ) , mac and cheese and bowl of co ##le s ##law . No ch ##ar ##cute ##rie , no cheese , no crack ##ers . Two lame bowls of Sam ' s Club level ch ##ex mix and fruit / nut mix . Breakfast cold wa ##ffles , cold syrup , and eggs swimming in water . A real disappointment . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First time in Chicago , visiting on a business trip but Eddie from the bar ! He ’ s great , made our stay a lot better . . he has a great , genuine personality . . I will definitely be back to see Eddie . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed the stay and the loyalty program gives you free coffee and newspaper and 2 bottles of water / plus w ##if ##i daily . The location is un ##beat ##able and the door staff / bell staff very friendly and helpful . Park ##ing was too expensive at the property itself but for $ 18 / n ##t on Park ##W ##hi ##z there is a AC Mar ##riot ##t lot 2 blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of our best stays in Chicago . The staff was absolutely wonderful . The location was perfect . The hotel was FA ##B ##U ##L ##O ##US . Very convenient to shopping and restaurants ; we were able to go most places on foot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Indoor staff and outdoor staff was very friendly . Always greeted us no matter the time of day ! They provided us with water bottles upon checking out and umbrella ##s for one of the days it rain ##ed ! The hotel is convenient ##ly located nearby shopping stores and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My group was very fortunate to spend the weekend at the Fair ##mont in Chicago . Our booking agent was extremely helpful and upon checking in we were upgraded to the Lincoln Park suite which had incredible views of the city and included accommodation at the Gold Pre ##mium level . The room was spacious and clean . The staff was very kind and court ##eous especially in Gold lounge where Sharon was making sure my friends and I were taken care of . I really appreciate the hospitality and would recommend everyone to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel with friendly staff . Stay ##ed here a couple of time for long - is ##h stays . High ##ly recommend the spacious suites in the new tower . V ##eg food in the room service menu and Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby for the hot chocolate ##s and c ##rois ##san ##ts during the cold Chicago winter are a tremendous plus ! Location cannot be beat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had three rooms celebrating my sons birthday ; The hotel surprised him by putting a delicious chocolate treat in his room . We arrived late and enjoyed a drink and a quick bite in Le Bar . Everyone greeted us with a smile and friendly attitude . Will definitely go back . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the 2nd time that I have stayed at Hotel All ##egro . The hotel went th ##ru an extensive re ##mo ##del since the last time that I stayed here . Front Des ##k Service is 1st rate all the way and the Front Des ##k Personnel was very court ##eous and polite . My room was located on the 11th floor facing Randolph Street . The room was de ##cor was to my taste and the bathroom was spot ##less . If your in Chicago on your visit I highly and strongly recommend this wonderful hotel . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed staying at this hotel while attending a conference that was being held there . The hotel was beautiful and the customer service was very good . The conference facilities were very nice . The room was clean and comfortable . I also loved the a ##roma of the P ##uro ##vel toilet ##ries in the room . The location was amazing with beautiful views of the city , lake , pier and river . It ’ s easy to walk around and explore the city from this location , or catch a bus or boat tour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room faced east toward Lake Michigan and had the most comfortable bed I ' ve used in a long time . Check in was a little longer then expected but overall , my stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand was great ! When visiting the Wind ##y City , if it is an option , choose the She ##rato ##n Grand Hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was very nice , and the staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly . The location is perfect for shopping on Michigan Avenue and Oak Street . I plan to return . Two minor issues : there was no TV remote in the room , and the lighting is too bright in the evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was available at every moment trying to make sure every need was taken care of . The bed was extremely comfortable . Small amenities were greatly appreciated from slip ##pers , robes , designer soap ##s and s ##ham ##po ##os . Extreme ##ly spacious room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would have like to had wireless to be able to do my homework during my stay . Like the Fair ##mont at Millennium Park . Just would have been nice to have Free Wireless . Also Reserve on Credit Card was twice of what it was suppose to be . Em ##p ##loy ##ee was all really nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Modern , clean and extremely well located . Din ##e in or outside on a warm night - - which was lovely . Staff seems to be determined to deliver above and beyond the call , so management is doing a great job . I liked the ability to voluntarily bypass house ##keeping . I was alone , so didn ' t need anyone to t ##idy my bed or clean up the bathroom ; much prefer the opportunity to be e ##co friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve recently stayed there for new years and we were lucky to get a corner room on the 31st floor with amazing views of the water and part of the city . Room had a good size with a super comfortable bed . Staff was really friendly and helpful . We had access to the lounge which made our stay more please ##nt . There was a large variety of food and drinks . Location is perfect . Walking distance from different attractions and metro stations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel in great location . Nice room , f ##abulous restaurant . Staff was friendly without being familiar , knowledge ##able , and helpful . I had a couple of times when I needed them to accommodate an out of the ordinary request , and they responded positively . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying at the new relocated Conrad . We loved this hotel and the staff . The staff was always very friendly and always asked if we needed anything . We travel a fair amount and this was the best staff we ever encountered . The location is f ##abulous as well . Only negative is if you want to do work , the area in the room for that is pretty small . The positive is the bathroom is very spacious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From checking in to check out , the staff was friendly and helpful , the facility / room was clean , everything was well done . The value was excellent . Location is close to shopping and central to all downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was a but hesitant about staying in an old hotel but I was pleasant ##ly surprised ! The oldest continuously running hotel in the USA ! ! 147 years ! The second largest hotel in Chicago ! Our con ##cier ##ge room had two bathroom ##s [UNK] . Great reception ##ist , Ashley ! ! Will return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was large , comfortable , and clean . A ##pp ##re ##cia ##ted having access to coffee pot , iron ##ing board , and hair dry ##er in the room . Show ##er water pressure was extremely low which was disappointing and room took most of the night to cool down . Overall was a very nice stay though . Staff was very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always a good time here . . best location in the city . Sur ##rou ##nded by plenty of food and entertainment . . Park ##ing could be a ta ##d bit easier but not that bad . One of the best views in the city . . and j ##us a short walk to navy Pier [SEP]
1	[CLS] Both times we stayed here it was to attend a program at the University of Chicago . If you book through the UC ##hic ##ago site you may request use of the shuttle to the school . We actually rented a car as we needed room to move items into our daughter ’ s dorm room . The v ##alet and self - park are price ##y but it is a city and you are paying for convenience . Our room has 2 queen ##s and 2 bathroom ##s . It was clean and comfortable . Staff were friendly and professional . We have eaten at Herb N ’ Kitchen for breakfast but there are many small inexpensive eat ##eries within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed in this hotel for one night . The customer service is excellent . From the check in through the check out everything was easy and perfect .

0	[CLS] I stayed here for St Patrick ' s day weekend with a friend . It was an easy walk to fun clubs and the staff was all very nice . The room was clean and had nice lighting for getting ready . It was a typical small hotel room for Chicago . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed here a few times both while it was Public and now Ambassador and I ' ve seen the same great service and attention to detail in every stay . The design and rooms are comfortable , clean , luxurious and the upgrade didn ' t hurt ! S ##hout out to Travis Howard and the sales team who support the property . Travis ' pre - trip support with a few things I needed was much appreciated as the trip wasn ' t planned . Sure to keep coming back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at this hotel 5 times and have never been disappointed . The staff go out of their way to assist in any way that they can . One of the bell hop ##s has been working there for many years and is awesome . The hotel is beautiful and in a great location . Would definitely recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel everything was so clean and the view from our room was beautiful overlooking the city would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Chicago on business or just an personal trip ! Love ##d it and the breakfast was wonderful as well [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have no complaints about the Public Hotel or the P ##ump Room . If I had to come up with something I would say the prices for a glass of wine seem a little high to me . We had a beautiful room , clean and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The day of the check ##out , i left my luggage in the storage room . when i picked it up it was broken . The front desk manager told me to send an email to him and he will follow up , after 4 emails and several calls I am still waiting for an answer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful older hotel off of Michigan Avenue . Great location near the John Hancock Building and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It was within walking distance of restaurants and shopping and their staff was helpful and professional . Our room appeared to have been recently re ##mo ##del ##ed and being an older hotel was smaller than al ##ot of newer properties but def ##inate ##ly was clean and comfortable . The price was reasonable for a Chicago Hotel and the amenities were outstanding . Breakfast in the morning was a great way to start out for a Chicago adventure and the waiter ##s in the restaurant were outstanding . Service was para ##mount for everyone we encountered at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . When we go back to Chicago this will be the first place we choose to stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay @ the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker in Chicago . Great location ! Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . Room was small , but the hotel con ##cier ##ge accommodate ##d us by holding our luggage on the day of our departure after we checked out , which was a great service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ski ##p this hotel . Over ##p ##rice ##d two star para ##ding as a 4 . 5 star . This place is all lobby . Room ##s are d ##rab . Bed ##s old and sa ##gging in the middle . Place smells old . No coffee in room . $ 10 for bottle ##d water in room . Room service is ridiculous ##ly over priced for horrible food . The $ 10 pot of coffee arrived late and tasted like the cheap ##est coffee possible . TV has crap channels available . This place is made for the most boring traveling sales ##men in the world . One Willy Lo ##man after another in the lobby . Stay tuned for more , I have yet another night here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I truly wanted to rate it higher but it felt like they put me in a room that was not used in awhile . The mini - fridge and hair dry ##er were broken . With all that said , the staff immediately resolved the issue by offering replacement items . They are very quick to respond to you ! 10 / 10 on service ! Otherwise this is a historic and beautiful hotel ! Picture worthy architecture all over . There are many food options but no free breakfast ( or free coffee ) . Park ##ing options are plenty . You can v ##alet , park in the heated garage under the hotel , or park across the street in an affiliated parking garage . The heated one is ideal but was full so I parked across the street . If I had a better room I would definitely think of this hotel more highly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The location was more than perfect . Young staff very enthusiastic and pro ##mpt . Almost didn ' t want to leave my room . When I did go out I was excited to get back to one of the most comfortable room . Suite view was spectacular . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a wonderful bout ##ique hotel that is very close to the major attractions , restaurants & museums in Chicago . Most are within easy walking distance . The hotel is taste ##fully decorated ; all rooms have large windows with lots of light . If your travels take you to Chicago , check out the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel - - you will be pleasant ##ly surprised . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in & out was fast and efficient . Room was nice , but a bit cramped . Not sure if all rooms are the same size . Reason ##able price for a hotel in that area . Bar area was nice and breakfast in the restaurant was excellent . Internet worked well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I decided to stay at this hotel with a couple of friends for my 21st birthday , on September 14th through the ##16 ##th ( a weekend ) . The service and hospitality of all the staff was quite the 5 star experience . Room service was on top of things and made sure I had everything I needed for the room , they even brought me an extra bed and even left me a Happy Birthday hand written message ! I made sure to get the names of all the people who treated me well and helped me out with my experience at the hotel , the manager Aaron was kind and helpful . The v ##alet manager Salvador , and the v ##alet attendant ##s Ashe ##na ##fe ##e and Antonio were the men who took care of my car and brought it to me in a time ##ly manner . The entire v ##alet department was wonderful ! Overall I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] On our 1st visit to Chicago we stayed at the Fair ##mont Mill ##eni ##um . A beautiful hotel with full amenities , great location near the lake , Chicago River and Mill ##eni ##um Park , the staff could not have been nice ##r or more helpful to make our visit memorable . Thank you Fair ##view staff , def ##inate ##ly will return ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This H ##ya ##tt location , while clean and well - maintained does not , in my opinion , provide reasonable accommodation ##s for la ##ct ##ating mothers ( e . x . no late check ##out times to allow for pumping and breast ##mi ##lk storage ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay in River North at the Ki ##nz ##ie . A perfect location , our room was spot ##less , beautifully decorated and sound proof ##ed . Victoria , our breakfast and happy hours ( both compliment ##ary ) hostess , was wonderful ! ! Looking forward to returning to see her again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for five nights while husband attended conference . Close to restaurants , stores and rivers ##ide . A ##rri ##ved late and after check in the assigned room had a view of the parking garage . Called to front desk and spoke with Mel who had checked us in and was super friendly and welcoming . After explaining I would be spending time in room she was able to re ##ass ##ign to upper floor room with a great view of the city and even came up to room and escorted us to our new home away from home . Made the overall experience exceptional . Only draw ##back was included breakfast was not friendly for diet . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff at this hotel was exceptional . My families first visit to Chicago and this hotel is central ##ly located to all of the spots that you don ' t want to miss . There was a suite special going on for Kim ##pton Ka ##rma members which afforded us plenty of space to spread out and find our relaxing place . The fold - out bed was abnormal ##ly comfortable for our daughter and the spa tub was a welcome luxury . Do yourself a favor - join their rewards program and treat yourself to a fine time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Pleasant , competent staff . Well - appointed suite . Air - con a bit noisy for my ta ##ast ##e , but I expect most wouldn ' t notice . Only down ##side ( for us ) was he Her ##mes amenities which we didn ' t care for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There are so many hotels to choose from and we selected Talbot ##t . The hotel and staff did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . D ##wayne & Gene and the rest of the staff - so at ##ten ##tive ! From our arrival to our departure , the team was amazing . Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again . Also , great location ! Joanne - Toronto , Canada [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good location and excellent services , good gym , good bar and meeting rooms , a ##ford ##able food and drinks , surroundings are very nice and you can walk to fine restaurants and city at ##raction ##s . I highly recommend this hotel ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can ' t say enough about the wonderful service at the Fair ##mont Chicago . Most exceptionally , Man ##don ##a in the club lounge was so very a ##cco ##mo ##dating and friendly . From our first visit , she remembered how we like our coffee / tea and got it started the moment we walked in . Her smile was so welcoming and made us feel like we were at home . Would definitely recommend up ##grading for the club service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Things were good aside from the hair in the tub and the confusion of the front desk staff . After cleaning my room there was a bunch of hair in the tub and on the sides . Day of check - out extended check ##out and front desk was confused . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this with a Travel ##zo ##o " Top 20 " deal for a short weekend trip to Chicago . With free v ##alet parking and breakfast , the hotel was a steal . The hotel itself was well worth the price without the " free ##bies " . The location was fantastic . The King room with Ma ##g Mile view was spacious , clean , modern and comfortable . Bath ##room had double sinks and great stall shower . Great technology to control lighting and d ##rap ##es . Love ##d it ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had breakfast and the 76 ##7 restaurant on the 4th floor of the hotel . High ##ly recommend . Our server was Charlie and he was excellent . Food and service is outstanding High ##ly recommend the eggs Benedict ! We liked the breakfast so much that we went back the next morning . Has a B ##uff ##et too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a jewel . It is in a wonderful location and offers beautiful common spaces , amazing food and fun bar . The rooms are smart and relaxing and the staff make you feel at home . Who could ask for anything more ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3rd time staying at the Monaco . Love this hotel , the staff is great , location is exceptional , rooms are large and very comfortable . On this trip there were 4 of us sharing a room ( hey we work for a non - profit so we ' re cheap ! ) and the room was plenty big if the view a bit lacking . . . we looked out at the cement vast ##ness of the parking garage . We took that as a trade off of the extra space . Laura our housekeeper delighted us with towel animals several nights ( who needs a cruise ship ! ) and wine hour is always a bonus [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location near Millennium park . Easy walk to river and Ma ##g Mile . Room was ok but nothing special . Ex ##pect ##ed more from a fair ##mont . It was perfectly ok but wouldn ' t stay here again as there are better hotels nearby . Not sure what they use to clean the corridors but it really doesn ' t smell nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay at this hotel at least once a year and always enjoy it . The customer service is fantastic and the room and amenities are first - rate . I called to work out a problem with an upcoming reservation and had the pleasure to speak with Al ##z ##bet ##a in in - house reservations . She was so helpful and fixed the problem very easily . She is a wonderful reflection on the level of service provided to guests at this hotel . We are really looking forward to our visit in April ( Hopefully , it will finally be warmer : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Executive suite is adequate ; but not amazing in size . The beds were very comfortable . There are 2 bathroom ##s ; which helps out . There seems to be a staff ##ing problem . We are Hilton Honors members and they always only had one person at check ##out . Room for 5 to 9 personnel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room i went to was small and dark and facing a dirty brick wall . I had to upgrade and pay more . The hotel is large and has multiple conferences going on at the we stayed . Look grand but pretty old . Probably won ’ t stay here again . The room with a lake view is very nice though . The location is convenient too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is excellent - location , rooms , staff , food in the restaurant and bar . Especially the gym is the best hotel gym ever , they have Tech ##no ##gy ##m equipment that you won ’ t easily find somewhere else . High ##ly recommended ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I called front desk at least 4 times to get my issues addressed and finally had to walk down to get anything I wanted . I was even told there will be a charge someone gets glasses in the room . When I went to lobby to collect I was told they will be sent in room for free . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was beautiful with very great staff to go with it . The only problem i had at this lovely place was with paying for a room i did not intend on staying in . I was charged more money not aware of the price told to me after already i booked . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A perfect stay as always when at a Hilton . It was a very busy weekend . Our room was ready early , very clean , bed was comfortable and the staff very polite . We loved our stay and if our kids would have too ! Luckily we got to have a weekend away ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location in the city center . We had a corner suite and we wished we could have stayed longer to enjoy it . Breakfast was very good . Charlie was one of the friend ##liest and ha ##pp ##iest waiter ##s we ever had . Only thing we didn ' t like were the ma ##son jar ##s they used to serve beer in the bar . It may be hip for some people - but we found beer served in jar ##s ridiculous and imp ##ractical . At least they should offer regular beer g ##lase ##s for those who don ' t like ma ##son jar ##s . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every single employee was above and beyond with their friend ##liness , helpful ##ness , and smiling faces . The service was beyond excellent . We will definitely be staying here again ! The American Girl package definitely paid for its ##le ##f ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived to be warmly greeted by the staff . During check in we were upgraded to a suite , great per ##k of being a rewards member ! The room was two rooms and was huge . The views were great . The room was met ##ic ##ulously clean . The bathroom was also very large . The window seats are great for seeing the Chicago River . Everything was great , lots to see , eat and drink in the area . My only complaint was the high cost for v ##alet parking , which $ 58 a night ! But it is Chicago and parking everywhere is ridiculous ##ly expensive . Great place to stay , we will be back when it warm ##s up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel has old world charm yet all the modern convenience ##s . It is well located in the bout ##ique shopping and delight ##ful restaurant area ; I could walk to nearly everything I wanted to . Yard ##s away are Joe & the Ju ##ice to start your morning off and a little further is Pain Q ##uo ##ti ##die ##n w heart ##y French breakfast ##s & lunch . Bed ##s at Talbot ##t are supper co ##zy & clean and they still have bath ##tub ##s whereas many hotels are switching over to shower ##s . Favorite part of my stay were the charming elegant elderly door ##men who greeted me , opened doors w a smile , offered to hail taxi , handle luggage , etc [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located just minutes off the CB ##D in a residential area which gives it a ho ##my v ##ibe . Chi ##c rooms and overall design . The team was nice and the wait staff on evening time at the bar were friendly . . . great cocktail ##s b ##t ##w ! If looking for a low key hotel will definitely recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are super clean and comfortable . I really like the suite configuration which provides enough room for 2 - 3 people to sleep easily . In my case , it was just me so it was even better . I was also on the 24th floor ( 2nd to ##t he top ) and had great views of Ma ##g ##M ##ile and the John Hancock tower . I would like to have had a larger soaking tub and larger windows but I guess those two things aren ' t as big of an issue . The arrival lobby and the registration desk being on different levels definitely makes the hotel feel less grand but the room definitely tell me that the hotel is a very luxurious hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel with antique features . Con ##ven ##ient location near many downtown attractions . The staff are professional and aim to meet your needs . I would stay here again , however I would request a room which is less likely to have the noise of nearby trains . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Classic hotel , gorgeous setting , awesome location ( walk ##able to everything you need / want in Chicago ) . And the service is the best part . Team is there to support , and if there ' s a problem . . . . immediately resolve and delight . While the property was closed during Co ##vid , it ' s a bit tired . . . . but quickly on the re ##bound . I ' d absolutely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay was ok . Room did not get cleaned after ##out 1st night there . B ##rough ##t fresh towels / toilet ##ries when we called about it but refused to take wet towels , stated " not my job " . Good location for downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the delayed check - in to the lack of servers in the lobby and dining room to the lack of any executive room service , we were thoroughly disappointed with our stay . A family holiday trip , and the hotel did not deliver [SEP]
1	[CLS] A s ##tor ##ied property and beautiful hotel . Excellent staff , services , breakfast ##s and bar . Wonderful room even if " standard . " Close to museums , orchestra Hall . I took train to Chicago , easy transfer . Con ##cier ##ge was very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I reserved a room on the Executive Level , and found after I checked in that the Executive Lounge was not even open for two of the three days of my stay during the evenings . Also , no room service , so for anyone hoping to stay in and work forget it . I reported that my tablet in the room - - that provided hotel information - - was not working , and never received another one . For the breakfast b ##uff ##et , guests kept returning with dirty dishes to the b ##uff ##et , used their own u ##tens ##ils that they had eaten with to get food , there was no temperature control for food on the b ##uff ##et , etc . A Department of Health nightmare ! I sent an email to the management , and never received a response . There are many other nice ##r hotels to stay while in Chicago , for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had stayed at this hotel before and decided to stay here again do to it ' s amenities and location . The staff goes out of their way to make sure the guests needs are take care of . Michael , at the front desk , sets a high bar in ##t terms of customer service . The itself room was large and im ##ma ##culate with outstanding views . There is a kitchen ##ette in the room which makes the suite seem like an apartment . The cleaning staff did an outstanding job . The basic internet worked well . There is a great indoor pool and work ##out room , which I did use . I highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here three nights with friends . This place is ideal ##ly situated in the vibrant River North neighborhood with everything within easy walking distance . We got a free room upgrade when we checked in because ours was not yet ready and the staff wanted to accommodate us . Didn ' t even have to ask ! Our 16th floor corner suite faced south and east . There was a repetitive parking garage warning w ##hee ##dle about a half block away that was easily heard , so a white noise generator would have been a good idea . Otherwise , great stay and we ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 4 nights . Our room was large with a comfortable bed . House ##keeping was great . Having access to Star ##bu ##cks from the lobby was also great . There are unlimited options for shopping and restaurants all along the magnificent mile . Close to sights ##ee ##ing options as well . Great location and great stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had an awesome stay in Chicago ! Can ' t wait until my next trip to Chicago . Staff was friendly , this was my first time in Chicago and staff gave me recommendations to restaurants that was near the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was very impressed with this hotel . Everyone was cheerful and interested in helping me and wife enjoy our wedding anniversary stay . The room was spot ##less and our view couldn ' t be beat . Everything on Michigan avenue within blocks of the front door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family of 5 stayed for 2 nights and 3 days . The hotel was clean with great amenities . The staff was friendly , helpful , and met all of our requests quickly . The compliment ##ary breakfast had a great variety for kids and adults . The location was central to everything we wanted to do . We were able to park our car and walk everywhere . All of the " hot spots " were well within walking distance . A great family friendly hotel in the heart of the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to Chicago for our " baby ##mo ##on " and had a great time ! The staff were extremely friendly , helpful , and overall awesome ! Seriously , probably one of the nice ##st groups of people I ' ve ever stayed with . We booked one of the river facing rooms which had a radical window seat that was totally worth it . We sat in it a lot ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave the staff are friendly polite and always willing to help and all with a friendly and genuine smile and hello . It ' s modern with a classic twist . Everything you need is on your door step from shopping to restaurants to attractions all in Ray walking distance . The rooms are elegant and modern . With rain fall shower ##s . The one thing I found odd was no room service was available but they have an information book and take out menu in your rooms and there are about 9 places to eat within 2 minute walk from the door which is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is sit ##uad ##ed in 6th floor , with a long wait for elevator . Check inn was the latest I ` ve ever seen in US . Full and busy , confusing breakfast . Not re ##come ##nded at all , beside its location , close to the most of at ##raction ##s and stores . + [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve been to Chicago many times , but always opted for cheaper hotels outside of downtown . So glad we chose to stay at the Intercontinental this time . Wow ! It truly was a completely different experience to be right downtown . Makes me love Chicago even more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a comfortable hotel with full kitchen and free hot breakfast . 2 blocks from Michigan Ave and 6 blocks from Theatre District . One block from the red ##line with easy transfer to orange line to take the subway to the airport . Check ##out is noon instead of 11 which is great for sleeping in and getting ready . View ##s are great too of city ##sca ##pe . Free w ##if ##i . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was wonderful ##ly large , comfortable , and co ##zy . The huge black - out d ##rap ##es were a dream - - they blocked out every bit of light and we all slept well . Great shower , decent bathroom . We had free wine in the evening and free coffee in the morning . And the location is just te ##rri ##fic . We ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great historic hotel . Room seemed like it was renovated in the last few years . Digital key is a great feature , I never had to go to the desk . Staff was very friendly . Stay ##ed for weekend to see Hamilton which is only a block away . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A huge thank you to all the staff . They go above and beyond . Almost feel like they became friends and it was hard to say goodbye . The amazing door ##men , Mark and Rufus , were so funny and helpful , we will miss them so much ! Kimberly , Mary , Richard and Katie at Kitty O ##she ##as , thee best ! Al ##y ##cia and Do ##y at the front desk . And the other staff who ' s names we didn ' t get , but who made such a positive impact on our trip . we were so sad to leave . I can honestly say this was the best hotel experience I have ever had ! I ' m already looking at Christmas time for another stay . Not only to see Chicago at Christmas time , but to see the wonderful staff again [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had first class service from the hotel . My family and I stayed one night here . It made our trip to see the Cubs play in Chicago awesome . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . We liked our room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at the So ##fit ##el was wonderful . Beautiful hotel , clean comfortable rooms and a great location . E ##asily walk to most of the highlights Chicago has to offer . Staff is court ##eous and friendly . Le Bar is class ##y and great for sitting by the window and people watching . The views from the room are spectacular . Wouldn ’ t hesitate to go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Swiss ##ote ##l is a very nice place to stay . As Chicago pricing goes , its also very reasonable com ##pair ##ed to other hotels nearby and just as nice . It has 2 re ##saur ##ants and bars in it as well . Walking distance to lots of re ##saur ##ants , shopping and Navy Pier . Will stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal was a great place to stay . Located on Michigan Avenue just north of the Chicago River it was close to shopping ( Nord ##strom ’ s was directly across the street with direct access to a mall . Our room was very nice and our hotel had all of the amenities you would ever need including Michael Jordan ’ s Restaurant , En ##o ’ s Wine Bar and a Star ##bu ##cks . I would definitely stay there again [SEP]
1	[CLS] You will not be disappointed if you stay at this hotel . The location was great as well as the overall service . The room was clean , the view was excellent . The venue for the conference was handled with care . the staff went above and beyond . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton has a winning property with the Hotel Monaco in downtown Chicago . Great location , gorgeous rooms , comfort and relaxation in every corner and staffed with knowledge ##able , em ##path ##etic staff . My first choice in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a very nice stay at this hotel . W ##aking distance to a lot of sights and shopping ! The kitchen ##ette was very helpful , especially for storing left ##overs or , in our case , drinks ! ( I booked this hotel for a girls ##g weekend with my sisters . ) I also liked the evening social hour . There were a lot of children and families staying at the hotel , but we rarely saw or heard them except on the elevator . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel ! Room ##s are elegant and comfortable . Food is spectacular , obsessed with the breakfast sandwich and the flat ##bre ##ads . P ##ump Room is the best ! ! ! Great and affordable happy hour too . It is such a lovely neighborhood and I am able to walk to work every day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was ok , transaction ##al and not persona ##ble . Sure , they made sure to ask if I needed anything but it didn ' t feel friendly / authentic . The room was nice , great view and location . At the time their pool and gym were closed for construction , they provided day passes down the road which was mildly in ##con ##ven ##ient for the tight schedule of my business trip . The construction during the day made it difficult to relax during the small breaks I had . Solid hotel room experience , but for the price I was hoping for a more elevated experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town for a conference that was held in hotel . Everything facility was was as expected . Even they G ##ym was of decent size . I think I got very lucky with my room , vs what I ’ ve seen reviewed . I was given a suite on the 31st floor and it was spectacular . So spacious , and comfortable and a great view of the lake . Everything was clean , including bathroom . Bed was comfortable . Small details like a compliment ##ary water in the room would have been nice . And the furniture was a little dated . Other than that , amazing stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This morning , a pilot and I were trying to get downstairs just before 6 : 00 ##am and the elevators were off . I called downstairs and was told they were testing the elevators . Why not do this at 3 : 00 ##am ? By the time I got downstairs , the hotel had removed the coffee stand , which is put away at 6 : 00 ##am . Again , why ? Not really a great start to my day , especially when the operator told me to walk down from the 11th floor . This is otherwise a well - located corporate hotel with nice amenities . Too bad . [SEP]
1	[CLS] hotel was fine . good location , nice lobby . Door ##men helpful . rooms a little run down and dated . $ 15 . 84 for two 16 ##oz bottles of water from mini bar - seems insane . when taking an u ##ber be sure to pin ##point your location otherwise it pop ##ulates as s ##wi ##ss ##hot ##el or lower wa ##cker . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was under the impression that my room would have a window seat , but it did not . That was disappointing . Also , the floors c ##reak . . . H ##OW ##E ##VE ##R . This hotel is super cute and luxurious and made me feel like I was some rich celebrity for staying there . And there was a leopard print robe ! ! The hotel is situated in the perfect spot , and the staff is seriously THE B ##ES ##T . They helped me ring in my birthday and I left feeling happy with my stay . The amazing staff definitely made up for the window seat . Thank you so so much ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Total ##ly first class in Chicago . Stay ##ed for two recent days in extremely poor weather Chicago . We go up often and enjoy . First time here . Great facilities and location . One recommend highly . Nice on site restaurants , very nice lo ##ung ##ing area and nice pool . Located directly on the river walk which divides city into going up Michigan Avenue or downtown . Close to all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador itself is lovely and in a prime Gold Coast location , but the staff is what makes this place special . Thanks to B ##re , Juan , Paolo , K , Natalie , Ken ##zi and the whole crew ! Everything from arranging a fridge to extending my stay was pain ##less . T ##reate ##d like a king from start to finish by everybody from the v ##alet ##s to the cu ##sto ##dial staff to the con ##cier ##ge . Can ##not recommend more highly for your trip to Chicago . You will not regret it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our latest stay at this So ##fit ##el location , I think our fourth , was all that we expected . From the sexy f ##rag ##rant lobby , to the smooth check in , to a depend ##able comfortable room . All great . Work being done on bar and work ##out room were the only negative ##s . A well positioned property , with tons of amazing food and shopping within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great location in Central downtown Chicago . P ##lent ##y of food choice . Check in experience and room excellent . Thank ##ful for the loan of umbrella also ! Would recommend a higher room away from the lift yo avoid traffic noise . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Two Nights Stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker ( stayed twice before in 2013 and 2015 ) . Very friendly and helpful reception desk . Quickly processed check - in . Automatic check ##out was a plus . Vale ##t quickly calls cab ##s for you . Very nice house ##keeping staff – room was cleaned quickly and properly . Excellent Bed King Si ##ze with fantastic pillows . Bath ##room with good lighting and van ##ity mirror was a plus . 10th Floor Room was quiet for a good nights sleep – faced north which is street facing but did not hear any noise or traffic . In today ’ s world , W ##I - Fi should be automatically included in your room without a charge – I was hoping this has changed since my last years visit – it has not . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel right in the heart of Chicago . Overall service was top notch , coupled with good food and clean rooms . Our conference was held in the same location which was convenient . Conference rooms were clearly marked and generally comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One thing amazing about this hotel is that it is within walking distance to a supermarket ! It made it very easy to purchase g ##ro ##cer ##ies and walk back to the hotel . Overall the grounds are well kept and the hotel rooms appear to be updated recently . There was a large crack on the top of my ceiling but it was co ##sm ##etic and did not impact the quality of my stay . If I had to choose whether or not to come back to this hotel , I would definitely choose to [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location . H ##ya ##tt staff was as professional and court ##eous as expected from this wonderful chain . I marked clean ##liness down a notch because the carpet around perimeter of the room was quite dusty / dirty . Not a deal break ##er , but should be cleaned . Location is perfect for walking or traveling in any direction in Chicago . Our room had a spectacular view of the river and navy pier . Very quiet and very nice stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I needed to stay overnight and decided to stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago and we booked a room in advance and was able to get a good rate . We stayed on the 32nd floor and enjoy our view of Lake Michigan ! We were able to walk around Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile which was close by and do some shopping . Our room was very nice and had all we needed . It was clean and very comfortable ! The staff was at ##ten ##tive and kind . I would stay again in a heartbeat when I return to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wow , talk about hip and high end . Stay here if you can . Personal service and high end finishes . Double sinks and private water closet / shower . Re ##mote control lighting and window treatments . Rob ##es , slip ##pers , and auto lights in spacious closet ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for the price , within walking distance to Mill ##eni ##um park , the fountain , and the river walk . Co ##mple ##men ##rary breakfast on every and have more choices for food . Check out is at 12 noon . I gave 4 stars because there is no in room mini fridge nor iron . I think you can ask for an iron if needed . Vale ##t Park ##ing is a bit higher other hotels in proximity , $ 69 per night , out by 7 pm next day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had the best experience at the Conrad . Book ##ed two queen rooms for our family . The rooms were very spacious . The location can ’ t be beat . Ty ##rell Brown was such an amazing manager and totally took care of us ! I would strongly recommend ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome location , just across the river you can go for architecture ride which is worth trying . Very clean facility . . . . . . Food is just okay , you have better option just outside the hotel to eat / drink . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Aside from the gym being way too hot and multiple staff doing nothing about it our room was great , appointed with very comfortable bed and modern amenities . The location is f ##abulous ! We could walk to all shopping and theatre in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is not our first stay here . The room renovations were very nice . We had a v ##alet parking deal so the price was right . The staff is very kind and willing to help . The lobby bar is great for a night cap . Will stay for sure again ! [SEP]

High ##ly recommend this hotel during your visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My reservation was booked and paid months ago . During my traveling I had a problem with my credit card , so when I got to this hotel I was told by the reception ##ist that I couldn ’ t pay for the deposit by cash . I asked to talk to the manager and see if we could find a solution and the manager was just rude . I understand that the hotel have policies but he had zero em ##pathy and patience to talk to me . No other option at all was offered . I ended up lo ##os ##ing all the money of the reservation and spending more booking a different hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful room with a great view of downtown Chicago . The Library bar is fun anytime of the day and the P ##ump Room is great for people watching . The staff is always welcoming and helpful , making the stay a lot of fun . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Hilton Chicago over Labor Day weekend . The hotel is very clean & the staff was nice . We stayed in one of the executive rooms , which is the category we typically stay in . I did not realize at this hotel , they do not have a lounge as they do in other hotels . They gave us a credit $ 20 a day to eat at the restaurant in the hotel . Our room was clean & had a nice view of the park & the lake . We were on the 23rd floor , but we still heard the street noise , which was surprising since we were so high up . It was worth the view ! The elevator rides were always interesting as they have facts about the hotel - famous people who have stayed there , how much it was a night when the hotel first opened , TV / movies that were filmed at the hotel & other fun facts . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s not cheap to stay here - but it ' s not cheap to stay in the loop - the location is fantastic . The atmosphere is fun and friendly . My room was quiet , clean & comfortable . I felt welcome every time I came back to the hotel . . . I loved it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an excellent stay at this hotel . We booked junior suite on 21st floor and the room was spot ##ty clean . The view was outstanding and able to see Lake Michigan . Am ##bie ##nce of a 5 star rating at the center of the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the So ##fit ##el last weekend and loved it ! The location cannot be beat and the price is amazing ! The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful , and the rooms were very clean and comfortable . The best part was being within walking distance of everything from great shopping , restaurants and landmarks ! We will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] They canceled my reservation for no reason . Good thing I called in 3 days early to inform them of a late arrival . I spent the next 3 days calling around to get my reservations reinstated . They offered me no compensation or apology from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights to celebrate a milestone anniversary . Hotel location is perfect near river , with views of river & Trump Tower on opposite side from high floors . The staff was super friendly & a ##cco ##mma ##ting . They upgraded us to the Mediterranean Suite that had high ceilings , window al ##co ##ves you can lo ##ung in , a gorgeous wood bed , u ##ber comfortable mattress & huge w ##hir ##l ##pool tub . Bo ##uti ##que class ##y hotel . Every time we went anywhere or came back , staff was smiling and greeted us . The only downfall was the small corner shower & there was nowhere to set toilet ##ries w open bottom sink . Overall , quite nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Prime downtown location , walking distance to places with action , though it might take 20 - is ##h to go to South Riverside . Very friendly and helpful staff , con ##cier ##ges in particular . Room was large and quiet at night . No n ##ui ##sance ##s at all ! Re ##com ##men ##ded ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The inter ##continent ##al Chicago was in the best centralized downtown location . We were within a mile - mile half of everything we wanted to do in Chicago ( Museums , Millennium Park , Navy Pier , River ##walk , CT ##A train , and shopping ) . The hotel staff was so friendly and helpful . The rooms were clean and s ##ty ##lish and the bed was super com ##fy . We were on the 22nd floor and the views were amazing . We ate at the Michael Jordan restaurant in the hotel and the food and services was superb as well . I would definitely stay in the inter ##continent ##al Chicago again when i return to visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For a historical hotel , it was rather b ##land . Everyone was nice and polite , the bar easily accessible . Room was very clean and well appointed . If you are looking for some Chicago history and like older hotels , suggest The Drake across the Street or The Palmer House . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel with two room suites . Only steps away from the magnificent mile shopping district down Michigan a ##ve . The best thing about the hotel that made me book the room in the first place was I could bring my small dog . Didn ' t want to leave my 6 month old puppy at home and this was one of the few hotels that allowed small dogs ( not big ones ) . There is an extra charge but I think it was only $ 100 for the weekend and I would have paid much more for a sit ##ter . There is a nice bar / restaurant located in the hotel with a good draft beer list . The v ##alet team were very nice and always helpful . I ' d definitely go back and stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just terrible . The AD ##A room was totally inadequate and un ##safe for a wheelchair - restricted individual . There was no way for an individual in a wheelchair to exit the room , no ability to call for emergency assistance , there was no phone in the room and the rooms smelled of mold and smoke . The desk staff was un ##ap ##olo ##get ##ic and un ##hel ##pf ##ul . The hotel is dirty and inadequate ##ly appointed . Beyond gross . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Home ##wood Suite ##s in Downtown Chicago is a very convenient base for the city . The building is nice , rooms well decorated and comfortable . It is just a shame that the staff experience is not on par with the facility . They seem not to care . I had to keep asking for missing essential ##s in the room . And the check in and out was not a friendly experience . I won ' t be staying there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time , though born in Chicago . Great view of river . Easy walking to sites : stores , Art Institute , Roosevelt U . N ##U ##BA ##A banquet and meeting rooms were first rate . Food and service was outstanding , i . e . quiet , un ##ob ##tr ##usive , not over ##be ##aring . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Luckily I only stayed one night . Front desk attention and service was great , but the overall style of the hotel is out ##dated and old . The carpet ##s in the rooms need to be changed AS ##AP , the shower / bathroom area was quite small , it felt almost European . The bed was comfortable , as were the pillows . Had breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and it was rather disappointing , the food wasn ’ t good . On the other hand the location is pretty great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here again for a week in October absolutely love the this hotel , rooms are all suites also great staff and great and very friendly front desk . Even sorted our trip out . The hotel is in a perfect location . We asked for the same room as last time and was no problem . We love Chicago and we will definitely be back to this hotel , we travel a lot and always look for an O ##m ##ni . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been to Chicago many many times but this hotel tops all of the others ! Love ##d staying at So ##fit ##el very professional staff and super beautiful clean rooms ! I recommend to anyone looking to stay in a luxury bout ##ique hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] From check - in to check - out we enjoyed our short stay . The front desk was efficient , fried ##n ##ly and ready for us and they were swift ! Our room was very nice with a great view to the west toward Trump tower . If you ' ve never been , spend a few extra dollars to get the river view ! We found the room to be a great bargain considering location , time of year , etc . The hotel bar was over ##p ##rice ##d but , then again , aren ' t they all ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a wonderful stay . Everything was great except the in room phones did not work and the water in sin ##c f ##au ##ce ##t barely trick ##led out . The f ##au ##ce ##t was an easy a ##era ##tor replacement and fix but the phone were not fixed at all . That was f ##rust ##rating [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect ##ly located hotel that has plenty of room for improvement . Hospital ##ity is a concept that many employees , such as front desk folks and a waiter in the bar , seem to not understand . House ##keeping sometimes failed to adequately clean the room . . . think dirty towels left in the bathroom and dirty coffee cups left on the desk . One te ##rry robe per room seemed inadequate , as did the lack of help at the front desk , which made for long waits . This hotel definitely needs more attention to detail . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in town for a work reception and decided to stay at this hotel due to its amenities and location in downtown . Per ##ks of this hotel included , 1 ) Whole Foods a 5 minute walk away 2 ) Easy and quick check in ( I did arrive at 1 ##am ) 3 ) I got upgraded due to my Bon ##voy status to the club lounge and definitely found it worth it . The place has amazing views of the Chicago River and downtown . They have free water bottles throughout the day and breakfast included eggs , toast , cereal and fresh fruit . My only real down ##side was the gym , which had 2 P ##elo ##ton bikes but neither of them were connected so I wasn ’ t able to use them . Other equipment was great though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was so welcoming , and in the perfect location . We had a room upgrade when we arrived and got complementary drinks at the hotel bar . The staff even held our luggage on our departure day . Will definitely be coming back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay when in the wind ##y city . Very clean and great service and a great view of the city . Very comfortable beds . Close to everything . You can walk to a number of great restaurants and some great shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome rooms , wonderful bathroom , great bar and restaurant on 20th floor . My wife and I went to Chicago for a quick weekend trip and loved everything about this hotel . We stayed often at the previous site but this new one was outstanding ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of the best Hotels for the value my wife and I have stayed in . Clean and taste ##fully decorated rooms , happy hour with all the wine / beer and snack ##s free of charge from 5 - 7 , breakfast and without a do ##ube one of the better located Hotels in Chicago . We were able to walk to any number of restaurants and shopping areas with ease and safety . The staff : Spencer , George , Victor and a number of others could not be more friendly , helpful and professional . What a great find . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Except ##ional hotel steps from Michigan Avenue . Well designed luxurious room was spacious , well appointed , spot ##less and comfortable . When arriving the door ##men were there to greet us and directed us to the elevator to the lobby at the top of the hotel . Check in and all service / staff were friendly and efficient . We had room service breakfast which was very good . This is a fantastic choice for visiting the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . We will stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was clean and historic . The amenities were good . Check in was easy and pleasant . The location is fantastic . It is right on Michigan Avenue . We were surprised at the cost of the parking . However , when looking at the prices for parking in the area this did not appear to be out of line . It was just a surprise after we checked in . Also , the honor bar snack ##s are weighted and you will charged if you pick them up for more than 30 seconds . Other than that the hotel was amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Classic hotel with nice surprisingly large rooms . Help ##ful staff , nice lobby bar , excellent b ##uff ##et breakfast . Near Hamilton theater and millennium park and art institute . Help ##ful con ##cier ##ge . Good W ##i ##F ##i . Good service for a very large hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] The view of the river and pier from the hotel was nice . The staff was friendly and at ##ten ##tive . The bed was comfortable and the room was clean . The water from the shower spilled out onto the floor . The hotel fees and price of parking were outrage ##ous ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] One individual , just one , on one day , ruined my entire experience after absolutely loving it in a previous stay . For an individual to tell a customer " there ' s nothing I can do about that , " after he experiences a ma ##lf ##un ##ction multiple times is just wrong . That ' s not hospitality . It ' s this one experience that would make me not recommend this hotel too anyone visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here one night while in Chicago . I got a very good price and was overall very happy . The hotel is in the center of Chicago on the river . It is in a nice area and you can walk to most places . Just be aware that the parking price is astronomical . It was $ 60 to SE ##LF PA ##R ##K overnight . It was in a secure garage but . . . . I think that is a bit too much . You can park within a block for $ 25 . The room seemed very clean until I went to use my towel and there were brown and black marks all over it . They looked fresh and not stained . G ##RO ##SS . Other than that , it is a very nice hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was clean , but the bed was to low to the ground . It sat on a frame . . . 10 in . off the floor . . . . then just one mat ##ress . Fe ##lt like I was lying on the floor . Room size : 10 ##x ##16 . You could not fit two people in the bathroom if you tried . P ##lug ##ged shower drain too . Taste ##fully done hotel . . . . but we weren ' t impressed with our room at all . For 300 dollars . . . . guess I expected something a little more ups ##cale . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Family event that turned into an engagement party . Guillermo and Dave handled everything and took great care of all of the guests . Fantastic service , professional , and friendly . I recommend this location based on the service , venue , and quality . Thank you Guillermo and Dave for helping make the day special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This has been my stand ##by for work - related travel for the past two years while in Chicago on business . In the Loop , I can walk to meetings and other attractions ( like Millennium Park , etc . ) . On my second stay I joined their club to get free w ##if ##i when I stay . I like the option to have gym clothes delivered , room service ( for late night arrival ##s ) . I love the window seats ( except in winter ! ) and often sit there working and people watching . Great deal overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was above average and easily met my expectations . Great location and good food options . I appreciated the care shown to room cleaning staff ( i . e , no daily service ) during the pan ##de ##mic . I also appreciated the selection of tea ##s available in the room ( a nice touch ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Must say - great location . Right in the middle of every where and a quick walk to downtown . Room ##s were small , but nice and good for a quick business visit . We were however quite disappointed to know that there is no room service ! Looking at the rooms , we hadn ' t expected that . We were in fact pretty convinced that hotel would have round the clock menu as well . So we had to rely on yo ##gu ##rt from Star ##bu ##cks next door ( location ! ) I don ' t think I will stay there again as I really need room service for my business travel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay at the Swiss again . Had a great time watching the river get dye ##d . Great location especially for St . Patrick weekend . Room staff was at ##ten ##tive and rooms were clean . We had no bad experiences [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our suite was large , living room , bedroom and small bathroom . Wish we had room above the 8th floor the view would have been better . Room ##s were clean , beds were comfortable . Clean ##liness in public areas could be be better . Hotel bar service was very good . Breakfast b ##uff ##et was good . The biggest complaint was the elevator wait . Good location if you want to be in upper Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great stay here . The rooms are clean and the hotel was quiet inside , even with activities in the Ball ##rooms . My first room was getting noise from the outside but I changed with no problems ! The location is great . I walked right to the “ Mile ” and was very close to the Pier . On a good day , walk there too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Okay , we attended Chicago for a football game and some attractions . I had taken my brand new car there and left it with the Vale ##t at this hotel . When we left , I found a huge scratch on the the front end of my car . I took all the pre ##ca ##ution ##s and advised the hotel that pretty much told me that they have no affiliation with the v ##alet ' s even though they are in house and stated that they are employed by Hilton . The Vale ##t company stated nothing could be done . I paid 800 dollars for two nights basically to have my car damaged . The hotel did provide me with 50 , 000 Hilton points that don ' t go towards anything but purchases from their site . Un ##fort ##unate events but nonetheless lesson learnt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Vale ##t parking was not available so you have to park somewhere else about 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel . Had to pay twice for parking due to confusing system when trying to get out . S ##pent the rest of the day driving around the city b ##c I didn ’ t want to get back in the parking lot and pay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was there for the Lim ##b G ##ir ##dle Mu ##s ##cular D ##ys ##tro ##phy conference . Was a very nice place rooms were neat and clean and pricing was good . Park ##ing was close and easy to use . Not used to v ##alet but they were fast and efficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved on a brutally hot day after a long journey by air and train . We were immediately greeted by friendly faces bearing water bottles and also te ##ddy bears for the kids ! Everyone was thrilled . We continued to find everyone very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting during our stay , including getting a warm cookie for our kids late one night despite the kitchen being closed and helping immensely when our kids got sick ! ! Location was perfect and it never felt super busy like other hotels I ’ ve stayed in nearby . . . Room was a good size for a family of 4 . Food on ##site is expensive . . . We ’ d return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Currently staying in the hotel and upon entering our room , the carpet ##s were filthy , the bed has not been change and there was a B ##O ##O ##GE ##R on our night stand . Co ##mp ##lain ##ed to front desk and they said someone was coming up to clean it . Came back from dinner and NO ##TH ##ING has been done . First time writing on Trip Advisor because I ’ m disgusted with the service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful ladies weekend away and the She ##rato ##n was more than a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to all our needs . We stayed on the upper floors , had access to the club lounge , and the view was spectacular no matter where you looked . The staff was friendly , helpful and on the ball no matter what we asked . The hotel is in a perfect location no matter your reason for your trip . I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was beautiful . Like going back in time . The lobby area and the bar area were gorgeous . The Hotel has a rich history and it can be seen all through the Hotel . The only downfall was our bathroom was tiny ! It could have used an over haul . All of the staff was friendly and helpful as well . It was close to most everything and the whole are downtown seemed very clean and safe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ent hotel with result ##ant attached as well as an Irish Pub across the street . The rooms were nice . Dec ##or was really a bout ##ique hotel style with some unique ##ness of your used to staying in Mar ##riot ##t or SP ##G . The staff was friendly and door man was as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s located just behind the Trump Towers & is waking distance practically anywhere . The room and bathroom is spacious and the bed is very comfortable . It ' s 2 min ##s walk to the river & there are so many restaurants all around so don ' t worry about catching a bite to eat . They serve breakfast & the way they have it is pretty unique . They will have the spread out in from of each floor ' s elevator & you just take your tray ( provided in your room ) , proceed to the lift area & choose what you want . Head back to your room & enjoy your breakfast ! I would recommend anyone who ' s coming to Chicago to stay there . It ' s comfortable but the only set ##back is it can be noisy at times as the walls can shake if someone closes the door too hard . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at the Kim ##pton Stay Pine ##ap ##ple hotel and was really impressed with the staff and quality of the hotel . I noticed that the All ##egro was just a few blocks over and closer to the theater we were going to . What a wonderful hotel - from the staff to the rooms I was really impressed . We didn ' t take advantage of the cocktail hour ( glass of Pro ##se ##cco or a green St . Patrick ' s Day cocktail ) because we were busy - but a nice touch . One concern I have when going down to Chicago is finding parking - but there were no worries because there is parking right across the street from the hotel . We will definitely stay again . A note on the W ##if ##i - it is free if you sign up to be a Kim ##pton Re ##ward ##s member . Otherwise , you do need to pay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wow , a wonderful experience ! Excellent location , am ##men ##ities and service . The full breakfast had everything , and the social dinner was a plus ! The staff was very helpful , nice and friendly . The location is excellent , near every spot you want to go . The room 120 ##5 has a nice view of the buildings and the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve been coming to this property for close to 20 years , and appreciate the updates ( us ##b ports in lighting fixtures to charge devices ) and the things that have remained the same ( several of the staff ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is by far one of the best hotel stays I ' ve had in Chicago ! Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful - - especially D ##wayne . We spent most of the day out researching , and the Talbot ##t is such a comfortable place to come home to ( even more so on the days we went out shopping all day ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very beautiful ball room . This hotel would make for a great place to have a wedding or an event . The staff was great and very friendly . I thought the rooms were very typical for most Hilton locations . Also a great place to get your shoes shine ##d ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n is a great place to access several downtown Chicago spots . Walking distance to river spots , Navy Pier , Michigan Ave , Loop , Millennium Park , and Chicago Art Institute . The rooms were clean and nice . Hotel staff is great . Park ##ing is expensive $ 55 per day . For quick fun you can walk from the Hotel to the River Walk which is a must do when the weather is nice . After ##noon drink at rooftop London ##H ##ouse nearby will enhance your experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] High priced comfort inn . The hotel is nicely done , some of the staff were rude . The beds were awful and the pillows were so flat I had to fold them up to get any support , called guest services to get firm ##er pillows , when they were delivered I thought a mistake was made , my husband chased the guy down , those were the firm pillows , looked and felt the same as the crap ##y ones . The little cafe downstairs serves Star ##bu ##cks coffee , that was the highlight of this hotel [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is located right on the north side of the river in downtown Chicago , convenient ##ly close to other major hotels and downtown activities . I was there for a convention and the hotel was sold out , but everything functioned well despite the crowds . The room was com ##fy and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay overall was great . I found it annoying that I had to pay for w ##i - fi and special t ##v privileges to watch a home game only 5 miles away . It ' s hard to understand why they would charge for that instead of just including the cost in the price . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Am ##bas ##ador Hotel was exceptionally clean and well appointed though the beds are a bit low . The employees were all friendly and professional . The location in the Gold Coast neighborhood is lovely and quiet . I certainly do recommend the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel quite frequently and it ' s usually the standard hotel location , set up , food , service , restaurants , etc . This Chicago hotel was different and it was the customer service and amenities . It very close to many stores / restaurants and easy to get outside food delivered too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location close to all of the tourist locations . Pleasant service . Clean rooms . Lake view is very nice , however isn ' t quite as perfect as the website leads it out to be . . . It ' s a little further than perceived , and big building blocking right side of view . To be clear . . . . It is a great view . The slap in the face : Hu ##ge fees for in - room w ##if ##i . There is free w ##if ##i in the lobby , but will not provide free w ##if ##i in the rooms . Really , that g ##reed is embarrassing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the Conrad , it was right in downtown Chicago . The staff was incredibly helpful and nice . The room was very big and had plenty of space . It also had a ne ##sp ##ress ##o machine with everything you would need to make coffee in the morning . The fridge was also stock ##ed with bottles water . If you needed anything , you could send a text and it would be delivered . The views from the room and the lobby are amazing ! We loved our stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is a g ##em in downtown Chicago . It feels like every single person on the staff has been school ##ed in being as friendly and as helpful as possible to every guest . In addition , the rooms are beautiful and carefully planned out . It is quiet inside ! Breakfast is included , which is rare in a downtown Chicago hotel of this quality . I highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Chicago for any reason . I will certainly be back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every aspect of this hotel was wonderful during our stay . We chose this hotel for our wedding so we could have a central location for our rehearsal dinner and wedding in the city . From the very beginning Maya Dyke ##ma was very warm and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . She made sure everything we needed was provided and the hotel employees were kind and pro ##mpt with their service . She was absolutely te ##rri ##fic to work with . Our family stayed here as well and they were impressed with how much the hotel went out of their way to make us feel at home . The service was perfect . That coupled with how beautiful this hotel is makes this place the perfect hotel in the city , regardless of what you ' re looking for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great place to stay for the show . About three blocks to Oak Street Beach where the viewing is perfect . The rooms are modern , well appointed and of average size . The large shower was appointed with a rain shower and personal hand shower . Everyone great ##ed us and asked what they could do for us . This included the Food & Be ##ver ##age M ##g ##r and the Guest Services M ##g ##r . They sought us our to offer their services . The entire experience including the parking v ##alet ##s were exceptional . We will stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is very clean , love the H ##2 ##O products and robes . The best part is the size of the room for a downtown area , it is close to everything , love the cocktail hour with app ##eti ##zer . ( They don ' t tell you about token ##s if you book 3rd party and tell you they don ' t have to give them which is understand ##able ) . No federal rate for our nights but we still love the place . H ##U ##GE bonus is breakfast on every floor each morning . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great bout ##ique hotel in the heart of River North in Chicago ! Staff is super friendly ! Wonderful fl ##av ##our ##ed waters great you each morning in the lobby ! Room was comfortable and the best was the breakfast ! On each floor they provide you with an array of breakfast good ##ies ! B ##read ##s , cereal ##s , fruits etc to take back to your room ! We loved it ! A great experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Conrad Chicago for my bachelor ##ette and you can not go wrong ! The hotel is absolutely beautiful . We were in the Corner Suite and had floor to ceiling views of the city . You ' re within a 10 minute walk from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . You ' re only 5 minutes away from a bunch of stores so you can shop till you drop ! We were able to walk to restaurants , clubs , stores , tourist attractions like the Bean . The staff was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting too ! High ##ly recommend . I plan to bring my fi ##ance back here so he can experience Chicago the way I did ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really nice hotel , friendly staff , great location ! We went to a concert at the United Center and were able to get a cab there very quickly ! The con ##cier ##ge was helpful in giving us many travel options to get around the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in an excellent location for sights ##ee ##ing and because it is a suites hotel with a heart ##y free breakfast it is great for families ! It is in walking distance to Navy Pier and all of its rides and attractions and it is an easy walk to the city bus tours that allow you to hop on and off ( be sure to get an extended day so you can hop on and off for two days ! ) . We found the staff to be friendly and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the rooms were spacious and clean . Having a kitchen was a real plus , especially a full - sized re ##f ##rig , when you have children included in the stay . It was a great choice for us ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The check - in process was pretty smooth and they even upgraded my room ! The view from my room was fantastic , the bed was comfortable , and they had a good selection of restaurants in the hotel ! I would definitely return to this hotel again if in the area ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 4 days . The location was f ##abulous . We like to explore on our feet and this hotel could not be better located . This is a walk ##er or public transit riders dream . The lobby is lovely and the staff could not have been more welcoming . We were greeted by water often when waiting at the con ##cier ##ge for recommendations or help . At check in the staff was welcoming and had some good recommendations . The room on the other hand was small and dark . We got the upgraded view at check in as a surprise bonus but , it doesn ’ t change the fact that the rooms are disappointing . Clean and neat though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My third trip back to Chicago since 2007 and third time staying here , previously the Am ##al ##fi , now the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Still loved the place , staff are so friendly from check ##in , to the lounge to the door staff . Room ##s are very comfortable , compliment ##ary drink served at 5 with food , great way to start the evening . The lady in the lounge ( Mari ##bel ! ! ! ) may have the name wrong , was very pleasant and looked after us very well . A few min ##s walk to the Ma ##g Mile ( 3 ##mins ) , this is a great location . P ##lent ##y of good bars and eat ##eries close by . Really enjoy this place and breakfast is help yourself each morning , opposite the lifts , when you wake early from jet la ##g , its great it starts early . We had no complaints and to return a third time says it all . New name , but retains its friend ##liness and charm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location in downtown Chicago . Clean and class ##y bout ##ique hotel with super comfortable bed , lovely de ##cor and all facilities you could ask for literally . Staff could not do enough and were so charming . Wine hour and coffee hour every day - how clever . Len ##t me ##a wheelchair as I had broken some toes . Love ##ly views of river from 12th floor . Park ##ing $ 58 a day very steep but comparable to anywhere else and very convenient . Red lines o good car not really needed at all but we were touring . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel and service on a central location in Chicago . It also has a great restaurant and cocktail bar at the lobby of the hotel . if you come on summer it is few blocks away from the beach and on winter you are 1 block from Michigan avenue ( stores and restaurants ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our room was huge , which was not what I was expecting in the first place . The staff was IN ##CR ##ED ##IB ##LE a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and so un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly nice . I needed help storing a cake for a wedding I was in town for , and without question they helped me bring it down to the kitchen ' s fridge , and then back up again when I needed it . They were S ##O nice ! The view was great as well . Can ' t say enough good things . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the start of our stay it was very enjoyable ! We were able to check right in early and everyone was super friendly ! The gym was great , and the night ##ly wine reception was welcoming . Great location , this was my second stay here and certainly not my last ! The on ##site restaurant had great salad ##s and a delicious breakfast ! The friendly lobby staff and bell men were always smiling , like they truly liked their jobs ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In Chicago for the N ##AC ##S convention . Everything was well done from a quick check in to checking bags . The hotel bar was p ##ric ##y , but the service was great . The morning breakfast b ##uff ##et was outstanding - o ##mel ##et guy was on point , except . . . our server WR ##OT ##E in his own tip ! ! ! ( Not “ tip included , ” he wrote it in with a pen ! ) . Management made it right , so it ’ s likely not a normal thing . Overall a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and I just had a wonderful week sights ##ee ##ing in Chicago . She ##rato ##n Grand proved to be a great base for all our activities . Clean room , good pressure hot shower ##s , quiet room on 26th floor with city and lake view . Pleasant & friendly staff . Located on the river walk and close to Navy Pier theatres , short walk to Millennium Park and Michigan Avenue . Also easy walk to major shopping district . Rest ##ura ##nts and great breakfast eat ##eries within 10 to 15 min easy walk . Thank you for a wonderful stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I didn ' t really use so many of their facilities and amenities but the room was great and clean , nice bathroom / rain shower and the location is definitely a plus . Wouldn ' t doubt to come back especially as the offer we had was very price worthy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay at the Palmer for the re ##ope ##ning and to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary . The staff was very helpful and pleasant and the hotel lobby St ##un ##ning . We enjoyed the c ##rois ##san ##ts and coffee for breakfast and drinks in the lounge before dinner [SEP]
1	[CLS] Were in town for the Rock n Roll Half Marathon Sunday morning and arrived Saturday about noon . We weren ' t able to check in but left our bags at the Bell Captain and got lunch and my sons race packet . Came back and were able to go to our room about 3 . Everyone was extremely nice and helpful . We checked out Sunday at 11 and again left our bags with the Bell Captain while we went to the aquarium and lunch . Before we headed over to the train station we grabbed our bags . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great older classic hotel . Walls are kinda thin and even with the ##rm ##o set to 68 we were warm . Located near lots of stuff . Park ##ing was across the street but okay . Didn ' t need the mini bar would rather have a fridge and coffee maker . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over the years , we have been staying in many hotels in Chicago during the RS ##NA annual conferences . Our most recent stay in She ##rato ##n was the best of all . We had a room at the club level with a breath ##taking view of the city . The room was perfect size the beds were very comfortable . The staff like Melissa at the front desk and several others were all very friendly and it seemed that it was a part of a culture than a personal attribute . The location was what made this hotel distinct both because of the view and the proximity to the tourist attractions in the Michigan Avenue for daily and night ##ly walks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able , quiet room - - on the 7th floor , as I recall . Had a drink in the lounge downstairs . Very pleasant . Was a short walk from the Blue Line L , so it was no has ##sle getting there from the airport . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago for National Restaurant Association show . Was on show shuttle route which was great . On the great end of Chicago . Lots of great pizza den ##s . Right next to main river and Navy Pier . Clean room . Spa ##cious . Great views . Not enough AC outlets . And compared to the hotels where the rest of our team stayed , for the same money . . . Swiss ##ote ##l was absolutely the best deal ! ! ! I heard complaints from our team at the other hotels of c ##log ##ged drains , doors that wouldn ' t lock , elevators that took forever and so on . I didn ' t have to deal with any that at Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a high class hotel , close to all the action , just a stone throw from Michigan a ##ve . And in the middle of every where . Has a roof top bar , the rest ##ara ##unt is on like the 20th floor . Room ##s are very nice , service is great . Love this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco Hotel was perfect for my business trip to Chicago . Well - appointed , comfortable and very functional room ; great bed ; and the " raid the fridge " bonus card was a nice treat . My arrival coincided with their " wine tasting " - a nice way to un ##wind after a travel day . The staff went out of their way to be welcoming and helpful . High ##ly recommend this bout ##ique hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great hotel for business travel , staff was incredibly friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Dinner in hotel restaurant was really great if a little price ##y for business travel . Hotel was also nice and quiet , which was helpful to sleep at night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this hotel many times . Very convenient location for Michigan Ave and the L train Red Line . This is first time there were maintenance issues . The a / c did not cool properly , the bathroom door would not close and had a hole in it , and the towels were V ##ER ##Y worn out . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome staff , amazing hotel ! From check in to check out they were on top of providing great service . The food was amazing and the rooms were gorgeous and clean . Our view was beautiful . Right across the Chicago sky ##line and river . We couldn ' t have asked for more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you love Chicago , you will love this hotel and it ' s location . A ##ff ##ord ##able . Park ##ing is a bit p ##ric ##y but not the hotel ' s fault . A few call outs : Emily ( Con ##cier ##ge / Front desk ) : She ' s amazing . Extreme ##ly helpful and even remembered my name and room # when I needed help the second day . Great attitude about her work . Cody : ( Con ##cier ##ge ) : K ##ne ##w all about the area and made some great suggestions during our stay . In depth knowledge about the whole city . Navigation tips , etc . Charles ( Door ##man ) : Been there 20 years ! This gentleman is funny , knows his stuff and has a great sense of humor . Please be sure he ' s there forever . Great person to greet when arriving back to hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The stay was pleasant with quick check in . Room was as expected but not necessarily luxurious . If parking outside the hotel the options are not the best and the lots somewhat ugly but saves you $ $ . Con ##ven ##ient location in the Loop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A standard upper end business hotel with some Conrad touches , not many . Nothing like Tokyo or Hong Kong . Missing charm and some finishing touches . The rooms are strictly u ##til ##itarian . Quiet , comfortable bed , decent coffee maker . Bath ##room had no bath ##tub . Space wasted with huge sink area . Co ##uch was I ##KE ##A - like and side table on one side of bed like a lost child . Nothing on it , no reason to be there . Close ##t was awkwardly placed . The lobby was dramatic but the rooms did not match . Hotel is right off Michigan Ave . , close to shops . It ’ s better than the Intercontinental but not in the same class as the R ##itz or Four Seasons . Looking for a touch of el ##egan ##ce in the Hilton chain stay at the nearby W ##aldo ##rf . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was truly a five star hotel ! Your restaurant downstairs served an amazing short rib . We were thoroughly impressed with each lounge area provided for good conversation and relaxation . Our room view was spectacular ! Thank you for excellent service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] this is my got ##o every time when I come to town for work or play . Great Staff , great layout . From the moment I entered the property to the moment I had my car pulled up , great experience ! ! I will continue to make this my first choice ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our large group . The location was perfect . The staff was delight ##ful . The room was very comfortable and clean . The food and drinks were amazing . Gene Murray the chef con ##cier ##ge went out of his way to find an item I lost and provided great recommendations for dinner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location near the lake and heart if Chicago . Staff was nice enough and room was big with a nice view ( see photo ) . It was very clean with com ##fy mattress and pillows . The problems , while all minor , were handled ( room keys stopped working , text are room was ready never came , out of free morning smooth ##ies that were part of $ 20 resort fee ) . Good thing I checked out with employee Te ##rik who couldn ' t have been nice ##r or more professional . We ' d definitely stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This beautiful bout ##ique hotel is located in the most central , beautiful and convenient area in Chicago . I often reside here and it never fails . Whatever needs or request I have , its team and es ##pec ##cial ##ly Mr . Travis Howard , is always pro ##mpt and available to deliver and help . I can only strongly suggest this hotel to anyone who likes to stay in a ch ##ic , intimate and well located bout ##ique hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If business takes you to this part of town , the Hilton is a good choice . A traditional and elegant hotel , with friendly staff and great service . Class ##y bar for a night ##cap . Some of the rooms have an amazing view across Grant Park and the Museum Campus out to Lake Michigan . Ask at check - in ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at several Kim ##pton hotels on recent business trips , and particularly like the Monaco in Chicago . It ' s easy to get to with a central location . Room ##s are well appointed and quiet . The bathroom ##s are room ##y and beds are comfortable . Especially of value to the business travel ##er , the rooms have plenty of electrical outlets , a refrigerator and good w ##if ##i service that is complementary for the hotel ' s rewards club members . The hotel is home to a very fine restaurant as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Property is great . Room is quite old but the location is ultimate . I stayed in May 2018 . No one was there to welcome . But at reception , the scene has been changed . Mr Hugo was so helpful . He upgraded my room . In the lounge , Mr Rene was very caring . I appreciate both of them , care and concern . I request the hotel to give them promotion . I want to visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An absolutely beautiful hotel , close to the Orange line and right in the heart of the city . Great team working the hotel and the rooms are fantastic . Even with the train right around the corner it was quiet at night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is of days gone by . Very grand . The room we had was relatively large . The location of the hotel is good . We had two beds and two bathroom ##s . As noted by others the beds do not seem to be queen size . The room was quite by Chicago standards although we had absolutely no view so maybe rooms with a view had more street noise . The four star rating was because of a lack of a view . The staff was friendly and efficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location in the very center of Chicago . Large rooms , very clean . Very nice view . Good breakfast . Extreme ##ly good and kind service all - around . Ex ##ample i traveled from Europe and forgot to buy US charge ##r for my mobile / laptop , hotel staff provided one in 10 minutes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice staff ! Tom on the front desk checked us in quickly and professionally . This huge property is attractive , historic and has lots to offer . It ’ s beautiful within well kept antique architecture . No in room USB ports but plenty of standard plug ##s . It ’ s re ##mo ##dled just enough to not look old ! My room only had two of each towel but the hotel workers were striking so maybe laundry wasn ’ t running full fled ##ged . Breakfast was awesome and v ##alet accommodate ##d our motorcycles . My room had a fridge too ! It ’ s close to everything downtown too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] De ##fin ##ite ##ly not the place to stay if you are looking for reasonably priced accommodation ##s in Chicago but the level of service , location and hotel amenities are com ##mise ##rate with the price . I was here for a business conference and ta ##cked on a couple of personal days at the end . The food at the conference was excellent . The in house restaurant the Columbus Ta ##p was decent . J ##J the compliment ##ary r ##icks ##haw driver was a nice touch . My only real complaint was that the ice machines were broken on multiple floors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Wonderful and friendly staff . Clean and luxurious room . I always stay in this property and they never fall below their high standard . The Fitness Area and Pool are also impressive and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service at this hotel was f ##abulous . The food in the restaurant was great . We used the bikes to wander Chicago . We both paid for river views but only one of us got one . And , all window seats are not created equal . The lower you are in the hotel facing W ##ack ##er , the more likely you are to enjoy " infrastructure views with water somewhere under the bridge . " As I mentioned , the service is great so I was credited for the inability to view any water . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , location , location ! Minutes from the Ma ##g mile this beautiful hotel and wonderful staff made our little get away weekend wonderful ! We were blessed with a beautiful corner room with all the amenities of home that boasts a nice view of the city . The breakfast spread was a p ##lent ##iful and friendly start to a couple busy days in the city . The entire staff was very genuine in saying hello , good morning , etc . , it was a much appreciated and welcomed gesture . We will definitely return to this g ##em and highly recommend it to those looking for a has ##sle free stay in a very busy city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very disappointed to have multiple heating issues ( even after moving rooms ) that led to a sleep ##less night . In the first room , the window was broken ( very draft ##y ) and the heating never actually worked , so I woke up freezing . After requesting a transfer , the second room was way too hot , and I woke up sweating even though the the ##rm ##ost ##at was set to a comfortable sleeping temperature . [SEP]

0	[CLS] We thoroughly enjoyed another trip to Chicago and our stay at the Talbot ##t was again top notch . D ##wayne is like an old friend so fun to talk to and truly cares about his guests helping out however he can . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a spontaneous stay here . A beautiful hotel , with significant history : A " must stay " of American hotels on the basis of this alone . The con ##s to start with : rest ##ra ##ura ##nt service was rather slow in the evening : the servers needed some prompting and were not entirely familiar with a 5 start service . You lost one star for this . The pro ##s : the customer service elsewhere was excellent . We ' d like to highlight front ##des ##k staff member , Del ##isa , who delivered imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , dedicated , and insight ##ful customer service to make our current and future stays perfect . House ##keeping friendly and eager to help . Bed ##s very comfortable indeed - we were su ##prise ##d . P ##lent ##y of charge points for electronics , despite being a very old hotel . Thank you so much ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in this hotel for a weekend . Hotel is nice , the mail area downstairs is pretty busy . We had a room with nice view to the river . Room was big enough for three of us ( 2 + baby ) . The location of this hotel is great , walking distance to the shopping area , or to the park . I [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location . Room size was excellent . My only issue was that the television didn ’ t work properly and I ’ m not sure if that was due to the weather . Normally I don ’ t care about the t ##v because we ’ re there to sight see but one of the days we had bad weather ( wind / rain / snow mix ) so we stayed in till it let up and during that time we tried to watch the television but none of the channels were coming in . That was just a minor issue for me because like I said if the weather was nice we wouldn ’ t have even cared about the t ##v . The overall stay was nice and I loved the location & room size ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . The location is a bit far from the action but still very close . The Gold experience is well worth it . The con ##cier ##ge was help friendly and helpful . The food was good . The rooms are a bit dated , but clean and comfortable . The Spa is small but good . The bar service was great [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel central ##ly located with access to major shopping and sites . staff very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Room well laid out with quality amenities by La ##nco ##me . En ##joy ##ed my stay at this hotel and will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Double Queen with River View , was an excellent location . Room was unique ( window seats were a nice touch ) . Bed ##s were comfortable and very clean . Wine Hour and Breakfast were a very nice touch and wish we took greater advantage of . Kim ##pton Monaco is just a few minutes walk to many of the most t ##raverse ##d local ##es ( Ki ##nz ##ie / Michigan ) and great if interested in the bars and restaurants of downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ed to Chicago for business recently , and brought the family along so they could do some sight seeing . This hotel is well kept , and the location is great ! We booked this hotel though Hot ##wire , and were lucky enough to get a great rate . For what we paid , it was worth every penny . Within 2 block of Michigan Avenue , and right along the river , it was extremely convenient . The kids enjoyed the pool , and while the w ##i - fi is not free , it is included if you are a rewards member ( I wasn ' t , but signed up at check - in ) . Breakfast is also not included , but I ' ve found very few high end hotels in downtown that include it . Save yourself a few bucks and buy you parking a the Ogden Plaza Self Park . Buy in advance and it is $ 29 / day , and includes In - and - Out privileges . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 8 nights to attend a conference at McCormick place . The room was comfortable and clean , kitchen ##ette was pretty reasonable ( although I didn ' t use it ! ) . The included breakfast is a useful bonus and the food was decent but not mind blowing . There are heap ##s of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance , and Eat ##aly next door is amazing ! Shop ##s and Michigan Ave are nearby and only a couple of minutes walk to get to the red subway line . The staff were friendly and helpful . For the location and comfort , this hotel was really great value for money . I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff were exceptionally friendly and efficient for a basic hotel chain . A couple of hours before arrival I received a personal text asking me what my ET ##A would be , and we engaged in a few more texts with a couple of questions that I had . The v ##alet dude ##s were great as well , and the front desk staff pp ##l were some funny folks . I even sang along to the PA that was playing I Got You Babe by Sonny and Ch ##er , to their amusement but to my buddy ' s ch ##ag ##rin . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago were always helpful and pleasant . Nothing was too much trouble from giving directions to securing extra toilet ##ries , it all happened without a f ##uss and always with a smile , especially the wonderful door ##man . The hotel is well positioned and within reasonable walking distance to shops , restaurants and theatres . We had a lovely room with great views of the river and surrounding buildings . Even the very noisy ' L ' train which is close by , didn ' t in ##tr ##ude . Don ' t forget to end each day with compliment ##ary wine and light ni ##bble ##s in the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel lobby and restaurant are nice and s ##wan ##ky . The overall quality of guest rooms , hallway ##s , bathroom ##s have room for improvement . The con ##cier ##ge , Gail Walker , is on top of her game , always remembered us and gave very helpful recommendations ! [SEP]

0	[CLS] I travel frequently for work , but this trip was a special Christmas present for my oldest son ( his first trip to Chicago ) to see Hamilton . Ni ##am ##h reached out before my stay , and when I mentioned the purpose of the trip , she made sure we had a perfect room and perfect experience . The hotel ' s location is central to everything . The room was great and had a view of the Chicago River and the sky ##line . My son said it was the best Christmas present ever . Thank you H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago for helping make this a memorable trip for him ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##cite ##d to see the updates to the hotel , since my last stay . Well laid out and provides all that is needed while away from home . Will definitely be using this hotel in the future . Location is prime with nice views ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was superb at this hotel , the furniture , the clean ##liness , the interiors and the overall am ##bian ##ce once you step inside the building . It is also perfectly located within walking distance to shopping , restaurants and even residential areas . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was here for four days . I am very satisfied with the location , the service , and the sleep quality . The green tea in the room tasted surprisingly good . I take one star off because the TV in the room did not work properly , every 30 minutes , it restart ##ed itself . I reported this to the hotel on my second day there , however the problem stayed there for the rest of my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Class ##y , comfortable , and affordable hotel for an anniversary night for me and my husband . It is a city hotel , so the rooms are small . The hotel bar had a reasonable selection and excellent service . We enjoyed our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for a family weekend . The rate drew us in . Our room was plain , bathroom old , pool had literally wall to wall kids and parents - we turned and left to avoid the insanity . Wait for elevators was forever . . . Might have been the weekend . . . Still fans of Hilton , just not this one . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay at the Fair ##mont ! They always aim to please . We upgraded to the GO ##LD experience and it was fantastic - Man ##dan ##a and her colleague were so welcoming and helpful ! Looking forward to our next stay ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] Location is the perfect one , near to the best restaurant area and to the mayor shop corner . walking from everything I had a standard suite ( 3 / 5 6th floor ) but it was nice , very comfortable very very comfortable lines and mattress and very good house ##keeping service Room had a big screen t ##v and comfortable sofa Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary coffee in the morning inside the breakfast corner con ##cier ##ge service is the only complaint : not so professional the one that serve me : he recommend me not the best trolley bus and was very slow making the reservation the Hotel do not have pool or rooftop that would help during the hot hot hot summer days when i visited Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just left the Talbot ##t Hotel . It was a wonderful weekend . The hotel is in a great location and it has such a lovely de ##cor . The rooms are spacious and comfortable . The staff is so friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting especially De ##wayne . The food in the restaurant was delicious . I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a class and enjoyed my stay very much . The room was clean , comfortable and very quiet given the location . The con ##cier ##ge was very knowledge ##able and helped with directions and recommendations daily . The night manager , Austin , was a professional and efficient person , who did a great job re ##sol ##ving a problem in our group . You will feel safe and sleep in quiet room where you couldn ’ t here the h ##ust ##le on the streets below . Walk to many of the north side attractions such as Navy Pier , Michigan Ave , Water Tower and lots of restaurants / bars . En ##joy this excellent location at a reasonable price for Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for New Years Eve into New Years Day with my S ##O . We originally had a room on the 16th floor , but it still wasn ' t ready by the start of check in at 3 pm , so we were given a room on a lower floor . Other than that the only poor part of our trip was our waiter for breakfast the next morning . He didn ' t really pay us much attention . It was a great stay , the room was clean , the bed was awesome and the staff was always friendly and up ##beat . The price was also a huge selling point . I booked a package that gave a breakfast credit and v ##alle ##t parking . We stayed in an ultra king room , gotta love big beds , and the total price was often less than single rooms available at other hotels ! Great stay and happy to say we ' ll be back in March ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice area to stay in Chicago . We had never stayed at this hotel before and we were very pleasant ##ly surprised . The front desk staff ( Travis ? ) was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and check in was quick and convenient . The room was very clean and trend ##y . Overall great hotel for our trip to a ball game ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great property , restaurant . Great am ##bian ##ce too . Good neighborhood feel , away from the major chains . Shop ##s more personal so you get a feel for the people . C ##ab fare average was around $ 20 round trip ( Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent 7 Area ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Chicago is my new favorite hotel ! After being placed in the wrong type of room upon arrival they went above and beyond to accommodate us . We were moved to the appropriate room by the bell staff the next day , given credit on our bill and given dining credit in the 67 ##6 restaurant . Every staff member we encountered was polite , helpful and truly seemed to care about their guests experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This k ##im ##pton hotel is in the perfect location , pet friendly , we didn ' t bring one , comfortable , modern , close to great shopping , restaurants , super s ##ff ##ord ##able , super staff , rooms are super nice , big and have all the am ##men ##ities [SEP]

Ku ##dos to Austin for helping to make our stay so pleasant . The room was clean and comfortable . Location was perfect for us . We look forward to returning . Thank you . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Staff are incredibly rude and un ##int ##ere ##sted in their job and just look like they don ' t want to be there ; which makes me think why not get another job ? There is no room service ; which for a 4 star hotel is quite frankly unacceptable . It ' s a great shame that there are many things that let this hotel down and these are things that can easily be solved as the hotel is in a fantastic location . De ##fin ##ately won ' t be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has no atmosphere in the lobby but most of all the rooms are badly decorated and d ##rab looking , bathroom ##s need make ##over . The size of the rooms are nice and have nice views . Compared to the Fair ##mont in Boston it is not at all the same quality [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was looking for ' events ' in Chicago on Sa ##t . past ( 9 / 13 / 19 ) . There is no live jazz at the Palmer house on Thursday / Friday nights . According to a staff me ##me ##ber , " there has not been live jazz at at this hotel for over a year . " The bar was crowded , very crowded . It seems like a good place to meet people . But jazz ? No jazz . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Very Close to our events . The food was delicious , we ordered snack ##s and lunch and I noticed quiet a few people getting up for more . Hotel rooms were very clean . The lobby always had an attendant that was ready to help and banquet staff was so friendly ! My team of Executive ##s were very happy with the Hotel and meeting space . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love this hotel for the great location close to the train and lots of restaurants plus close to Ma ##g Mile shopping and attractions . Room ##s are comfortable and great amenities , and staff is super welcoming and helpful . Love ##d having the kitchen facilities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s a nice ##ish hotel but the room was awkwardly arranged - t ##v on dresser along side wall instead of facing bed ; no place to set up the coffee maker near an outlet without putting it on the floor . Ann ##oy ##ing fridge c ##ram ##med full of mini bar items - minimal room for our drinks . Plus they locked the fridge the last morning before we could get our drinks out . Con ##ven ##ient location for all things Chicago downtown [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location to watch the Thanksgiving parade and s ##tro ##ll the shops on Michigan Ave . Walking distance to Mill ##eni ##um Park , and a br ##isk walk down to the Navy Pier . Staff was friendly and helpful , room was comfortable and spacious . We will be back . [SEP]

1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the Talbot ##t for 4 nights mid - June . The hotel is small ( in a good way ) , elegant and intimate . Staff was excellent . We had a queen room which was somewhat small but comfortable . Spa ##cious bathroom . There are larger king rooms available if that ' s important to you . The de ##cor throughout the hotel is taste ##ful and fresh . En ##ti ##re hotel is very clean . This is an older hotel but the interior has been completely re - done , nothing looks old or worn . Location is very convenient , with many restaurants and coffee shops nearby . Subway is about 2 blocks away . We didn ' t eat in the hotel restaurant but we enjoyed drinks at the bar . I would highly recommend the Talbot ##t to anyone who is bored with H ##ya ##tt - type hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our experience was first rate ! The hotel was im ##ma ##culate and we had excellent service from the Vale ##t to the Front Des ##k to the Clean ##ing Staff . Special shout out to Nicole T . and Noel in Vale ##t ! ! High ##ly recommend ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not only was this place was im ##ma ##culate ##ly designed and decorated ( the lobby is AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! ) , B ##UT the staff is just as amazing . From the 1 am check - in with a friendly reception to the v ##alet , Sami , who took the time to pet my t ##im ##id dog and offer her treats while we were waiting for the car , our experience was one of the best hotel experiences I have had in a long time . I booked the hotel , while we were driving because we were on the road and not sure where we would end up for the night . We were looking for a pet friendly location and we found it . They brought up a dog bed and food and water bowls and gave us treats at check - in . The room was small , but beautifully decorated and well designed . ST ##A ##Y H ##ER ##E and BR ##ING YOU ##R D ##O ##G ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved this hotel ! The location was perfect , we had easy access to shopping and to Millennium Park and the Art Institute , all by walking . It was also easy to catch the bus . The staff was so at ##ten ##tive and friendly . There is a full service Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby . Will stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff seemed un ##p ##re ##par ##ed to host a large conference of people . I was placed in the wrong room at check in , resulting in being walked in on by other guests . Hotel over ##book ##ed for the period of the conference , leaving some attendees without rooms . View was beautiful and the room was comfortable , but I am unlikely to stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have been staying at this hotel for many years . It seem to get better with age . The staff is always a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . In addition to being a great hotel it also provides an excellent catering staff . We would never consider using a different hotel in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] This photo says it all about the accommodation ##s . Only here for two nights so I will cope but seriously ? This is what they gave me for a room . Luckily I travel with situations like this in mind . Love the stain ##s on the doors and the ample sink area . Perfect for a professional woman traveling to a conference . . . not . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was used by a group for a meeting held off site . I was very impressed by the renovation that has been completed , The lobby is very attractive . My king size bedroom was smaller than newer hotels but very well appointed . My only complaint was no coffee maker . There is coffee service available in the lobby beginning at 6 : 00 am . The hotel staff was most g ##rac ##ious and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . David , the con ##cier ##ge made reservations and assisted me with my IP ##ad . Apparently renovations are ongoing based on a letter on the nightstand . I recommend this attractive ##ly renovated hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sisters and I went to Chicago for a weekend for my birthday . The staff at the ambassador were absolutely amazing ! So friendly . Our rooms were very clean . The hotel was within walking distance of Gibson ' s , Carmine ' s and Michigan Ave . We asked for a refrigerator and one as brought up to the room right away . I would definitely recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] restaurant service was real slow and spot ##ty for drinks at night and breakfast . Wait ##ed 10 minutes for a drink order that I ended up getting myself from bartender . Breakfast took 15 minutes just to get a co ##ffe served . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Be very careful when booking . I booked early and realized that the price per night had dropped by almost one hundred dollars a night . Hilton would not allow a cancel / re ##book . In addition , when paying over $ 350 / night , one would expect at least a coffee machine in the rooms , but there is not . The location has a lot of history and is very central ##ly located . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This property is very central ##ly located and is even close to a few historical , scenic sites , including the private Dr ##ie ##haus Museum , the historic Water Tower , and Mike Di ##t ##ka ' s Bar ; ) . The hotel bar is super ( and super expensive , naturally ) , and the restaurant offers free coffee / c ##rois ##san ##ts in the morning . The front desk staff was great , including the guy who was very interested in my running status for half - marathon ##s and my daily runs ! I also found the copies of Le Mon ##de sitting around to be adorable . Thank you for a lovely 5 - day stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : nice lobby , central location Con ##s : carpet is old and s ##tin ##ky , tiny rooms / beds , clean ##liness is questionable , stain ##s on walls and ceiling , p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper , electrical outlets not fixed to the wall , very noisy , bugs in the room ( yes , B ##U ##GS ! ) , rude staff , no coffee in rooms , no room service , shower feels dirty , low water pressure , and the list goes on . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I want to definitely give a big thanks to Nick C . At the front desk . I flew in early in the morning , with the intention of doing some sights ##ee ##ing . Nick directed me to the luggage storage area and let me know that he could set me up for early check in . When the room was ready I got a text and they had me all set . I really enjoyed checking out the city without having to worry about my bag . Thanks to the staff and Nick ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Birthday celebration was a success . This was our fourth stay and was enjoyed by all ! The entire staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Special shout out goes to D ##wayne at the door . He was great with everyone in our party . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I spent several days here and were very impressed by the service . We took full advantage of the complementary items : coffee bar , sang ##ria , and mail ##ing of All ##egro banged post ##cards ( my f ##ave , sent 25 ) . Special shout outs to Adrian ##a V , who knew me by name after just one interaction and Jimmy in the lobby bar , a great conversation ##alis ##t and f ##ut ##bol expert ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for business , and probably would never come back . The only red ##ee ##ming quality was that it ' s a Hilton property and I wanted points . I wasn ' t satisfied by the level of service ( as such a big hotel , they are unable to provide adequate service ) . I wasn ' t given bottles of water upon check in , the door ##men didn ' t open the doors or try to call me a cab when I had my luggage etc . I had to s ##ch ##le ##p everything to my room on my own . The rooms were also old , furniture also too old , and facilities not in good condition . Would not recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel . Love the room and the size of the room . Bath ##room is amazing with the separate tub and shower . . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds . Service is excellent . Restaurant ##s serve amazing food . Will use this hotel for future travel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not a Fair ##mont of usual standard and would perhaps truly rate it as a 4 star hotel for room quality and service . But to be fair , it is comparing it with Canadian , Middle East and Asia Pacific Fair ##mont ' s , which is of far superior quality . Location was excellent being in the centre of activity . Not much views by way of the river but overlooking the park and lake . Mu ##gi , the con ##cier ##ge supervisor in the lounge rescued what was an average stay to a good one , attending to a few issues raised and promptly re ##sol ##ving it . He and his counterpart colleague , were both very at ##ten ##tive at organising con ##cier ##ge tours and the like . Thank you Mu ##gi . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location in the heart of downtown . Large rooms , high ceilings , super comfortable beds , excellent reasonably priced restaurant in the lobby , free wireless , . . . . and great ho ##sp ##ita ##ble level of service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located off Michigan Avenue and Rush , the Conrad is an exquisite hotel with super friendly and court ##eous staff . They go out of their way to make sure your needs are met . The rooms are plus ##h and luxurious but not overly so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The door ##men / v ##alet ##s Sur ##ren ##der and D ##mit ##ri were very friendly and helpful . G ##ave us good advice on where to eat , shop and find free parking at the Science Museum . I was also very impressed with all of the breakfast and evening happy hour staff . They were very friendly , polite and efficient . The breakfast and happy hour foods were top quality . Our family loved our corner suite with a view of the Trump tower 3 blocks away . With a subway stop one block away , and the Miracle Mile 3 blocks away , this is a great downtown location . Nice views from the 19th floor pool . We would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here on a visit to see " Hamilton " at C ##IB ##C theater . It was the next block over , so even though it was cold and rainy , we didn ' t mind walking to the theater . We could even see the ma ##rque ##e from our hotel room ! Bath ##room was super tiny , our only complaint . Hard to even get in there far enough to close the door ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here recently for a company conference . + Location is within walking distance to everything . Restaurant , bars , shopping , theatres and museums are minutes away . + The West tower offers a great view of the river . + Staff are professional , house ##keeping are very thorough . + Am ##eni ##ties are great . Hotels offers great selection of restaurants and bars for your convenience . + Co ##m ##fy bed ##ding ##s , bathroom water pressure was good . W ##if ##i is fast and free . - Room size is decent , however I found it very dated and could use some re ##f ##reshing . - Car ##pet ##s are f ##ray ##ed and the window d ##rap ##es are just so old fashioned style Overall a good experience , no major issues . Check In / Out was sea ##m ##less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay at the So ##fit ##el . Location is perfect ( actually , every single local U ##ber driver confirmed this ) . Room ##s very comfortable and clean . Reason ##able price . But what sets it apart is the staff . Professional , friendly , genuinely glad to see you and help you . Absolutely everyone : Re ##ception , Con ##cier ##ge , Bar , House ##keeping . . . everyone ! We are extremely grateful to Peter and the rest of the con ##cier ##ge staff ( V ##erne , O ##s ##bal ##do and Bernard ) . They helped us organize our stay in Chicago . From tour reservations to help with directions , and how to ma ##xi ##mize our time and be able to see everything at the best time and locations . It was our first visit to Chicago and thanks to Peter and the rest of the So ##fit ##el staff , we are already looking forward to our next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice lobby . Nice people . Nice spa facility but machines in need of se ##r ##vic ##ing . Un ##im ##pressive small older room . Half outlets do not work . The elevators are loud and sound like a subway starting and stopping . . . . . all night . Except for the excellent location near the Art Institute , I ' d give it 2 stars . I am a Hilton guy and I would stay at a Hampton Inn any day over this hotel [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed a night at the Conrad Chicago Hotel as we celebrated our anniversary . Our Guest Service Ambassador , Mi ##cha ##il Williams , was E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##T ! ! ! He made sure we had everything we needed for our night stay . He had a wonderful disposition , was very knowledge ##able , and was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Whenever we did need some additional information , the ability to send a quick text to hotel staff to get the answer was so convenient ! That is a really nice feature . Our room was so nice and we loved the amenities . We will definitely be returning here soon and hope we can request Michael Williams to be our ambassador again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad in Chicago is a good hotel in an excellent location but it is not up to the standards of other Conrad ##s we have stayed at , e . g . problems with the ventilation , parking arrangements and delivery of Diamond benefits . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is fantastic . So much to do and see that is in walking distance , and most importantly felt safe . Also if you get tired of walking or want to get further out the taxi ' s and U ##ber ' s were quick and easy to get especially thanks to the door ##men . The staff were all friendly and helpful , and in my opinion make the hotel great . The rooms were clean , nice and comfortable . Will definitely recommend and stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an awesome property with wonderful amenities and an extremely professional staff . We had as nice of a time as we could have ever imagined . The location is outstanding and the quality of the hotel is exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great experience at the Inter Continental . Food at Michael Jordan bar was very good and the service was nice . Our Room was quiet and comfortable . We would have appreciated more “ free ” space in the fridge , but made due . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was excellent but the room was only fine and clean ##liness was not up to par . Pay ##ing for w ##if ##i , parking and taxes more than doubles the bill . We chose this hotel primarily for it ' s location , but we would choose something else next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location . It has easy access to stores , restaurants , and the CT ##A subway . The entire staff was wonderful , from the parking v ##alet , to the maid service , to the front desk staff , to the manager who stopped by our table at breakfast to make sure everything was okay . The room was very nice ; clean , spacious and up to date . The full kitchen was a wonderful per ##k to have . Check - in and check - out was quick and easy . I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay in the Chicago downtown area . We will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is very beautiful and has a history behind it . It has also been apart of many films and TV shows . You feel like you just stepped in royalty when you walk in . It is definitely worth the stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the second time in two years we have stayed at this hotel . In between our last stay and this stay a room renovation took place . The rooms are very nice . This is a great place to stay , especially if traveling with family or staying for a longer period of time . You have everything you need in a kitchen , a nice living space and separate bedroom . We were in a King one bedroom . The breakfast each morning was very good , but it is so nice to have the option of having your own food in the kitchen . We did have a little trouble keeping the room as cool as I would have liked but this seems to be a problem in all hotels these days , where A / C units and vent ##ing do not really fit the spaces . Vale ##t parking is also expensive ( $ 59 a night ) - we will use Spot ##her ##o next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This lovely hotel was a pleasure from check - in through the whole visit ! Room was im ##ma ##culate , very comfortable , big shower and bath room ! I ’ d definitely stay here again ! Also , incredible view of Ferris wheel and water walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kate the bartender has a great service oriented spirit . . . has a positive way with the client ##ele . . . made the stay enjoyable . . . a re ##f ##reshing smile and willingness to serve ! ! The other service areas in hotel could learn a thing or two from her ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great find ! Great location . Many restaurants and bars within easy walking distance . Nice room and comfortable bed . Friendly staff . Gotta love the great social hour with free app ##eti ##zers and drinks ! I will certainly stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In ##different front desk staff , check - in line 12 deep , no room service , c ##liche ##d and dated de ##cor . Other than that . . . . I mean , what happened to the Kim ##pton cache ? How do you run a " 4 - star " hotel without room service ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The entire management team and team members deliver 5 star customer services on a daily basis . My experience at the Talbot ##t Hotel was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . I will definitely come again . Next time for leisure . Two individuals that were extremely customer oriented and did an excellent job was Mr . D ##wayne , who has a magnificent demeanor and definitely a people person . Ms . Rowan ##da at the Con ##cier ##ge desk is a lovely pleasant person with a great personality . They definitely make your experience a memorable one . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Home ##wood Suite ##s in Chicago is a must stay if you are in Chicago . Great price , great suites , great amenities ( breakfast and evening reception with food and drinks ) . The hotel is right in the center of downtown so it ' s close to E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a very pleasant surprise , was ease to get to and was in a perfect location to the Navy pier and all the restaurants and shopping ! Family loved it ! Clean and great services ! Right in the river , good views . Staff was very helpful ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] All the comfort ##s of home - co ##zy bed , kitchen , breakfast and pool , for a great price , within walking distance of Navy Pier and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ( shopping ) and wonderful restaurants . Our family will stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed four nights and found the room to be lovely and quiet , and very clean . Good central location we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go . Some towel rails in the bathroom would have been a nice extra to have . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel room needs face ##lift . Bed ##ding was uncle ##an had make up & hair on sheets . Change ##d bed myself per staff member didn ##t , only brought sheets . A ##ppe ##ars was main ##tan ##ce man dropping sheets @ the door . To ##ile ##t paper was not changed per two rolls that were almost finished in bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here with our two kids and felt welcomed by the staff - - con ##cier ##ge was spot on with restaurant and tourist suggestions . The Saturday night family movie night in the pool was fun . The historic pool is beautiful and we appreciated having a lap lane . The fitness center is fine but nothing fancy . The hotel location is absolutely perfect and within walking distance to both the loop area and magnificent mile . The room was small but clean and up to date . In general , this hotel felt a bit more " self - serve " than other hotels I ' ve stayed in the area , but I prefer that . My only complaint was that they could use more elevators for the Grand tower side - - the wait was long sometimes with lots of full elevators . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was worth every dim ##e spent , the rooms were co ##zy yet spacious . The kitchen had every utility im ##agi ##na ##ble , and the staff was outstanding . I ' ll definitely be returning to the home ##wood suites in the near future [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni was central ##ly located on Michigan Avenue with a great price ( and you get a suite ) , comfortable , clean , customer service is wonderful . We loved visiting Chicago and having a wonderful stay at the O ##m ##ni enhanced the visit . Thank you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel in a wonderful location . I recommend the executive level on the higher floors . Beautiful views of the lake , fountain , and pier . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary coffee and tea are a plus . Staff checks in with you via text to ensure your are satisfied during your stay . Nice touch ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We greatly enjoyed our stay here . It was truly a beautiful hotel and the location was great ! Of Historic hotels in Chicago it was kept up very well . We would recommend it to anyone . We paid ##8 ##8 bucks for one night that ' s not bad for downtown Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very lovely rooms - clean , comfortable and class ##y . The d ##é ##cor is very attractive and the bed was comfortable . I visited this hotel for a conference but it was one of the nice ##st hotels I have stayed in . There was plenty of shopping within walking distance . Being from a small town , the cost of the v ##alet parking caught me off guard , but was not out of line for Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has been opened less than one year . Do not con ##fuse it with the old Conrad which is currently known as the Gwen . The new Conrad is fantastic - - very nice d ##é ##cor . I attended a conference and the services and food quality were excellent . I liked the outdoor rooftop su ##shi bar . I wish there were a pool . Great location downtown . The only problem was that our room did not have a table big enough to use as a desk . When we looked up the rooms on line , we saw that tables usually were in the rooms of our type . Check in desk was very under ##sta ##ffed the whole time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel well located for Ma ##g Mile activities , rooms are clean , good amenities ( internet only free if you are an O ##m ##ni member ) , staff generally helpful . Room not well - sound ##proof ##ed - I could hear the conversations in the adjoining room , fortunate ##ly they fell asleep at a decent hour . I must have mi ##sun ##ders ##to ##od that corner suites only have king beds . I had booked one for two people - they had no other rooms with two beds - good thing there was a sofa bed . It was ok - but I would probably book a different hotel where I ' ve stayed before in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is right in the loop . Less than 10 minutes walk to Millennium Park and the start of Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . A block away from the River ##walk . Lo ##bby is gorgeous . Staff is extremely friendly and helpful . We got a double queen room facing an office building . There was 2 deep window seats overlooking N W ##aba ##sh Ave . Room is very clean but the furniture seemed a bit dated . Bed was extremely comfortable but I could hear the train in the morning as the tracks are only about a block away . There ' s tea and coffee in the morning and a happy wine hour from 5 ##pm - 6 ##pm which is nice . En ##joy ##ed our stay here mostly for the location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is fantastic and in walking distance to a lot . The bed is comfortable though the room feels dated and the bathroom standard for sure . El ##eva ##tors are a bit slow . My only real complaint is the fitness center . As big as this hotel is it is very small , 1 / 2 the t ##read ##mill ##s don ’ t work and the weight area is really really cramped . Very disappointed but if you choose to run outside you have easy access to run by the river and Lake Michigan . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was our first time staying here . Check in was smooth . Had a beautiful view from our 25th floor . The room had nice finishes . We used the pool and w ##hir ##l ##pool . It was nice that the water te ##mp was hot in the w ##hir ##l ##pool after a long day of walking around . The staff was very friendly from the time we stepped out of the cab to the maintenance man we saw in the hall . Looking forward to my return in August to celebrate a 60th b ##day girls shopping - night away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay here often for work because it is so close to my office , and I really have to say that I ' ve grown to hate this hotel . The rooms are generally small and the bathroom ##s are micro ##scopic . The elevators are so slow , i no longer stay on any floor above 5 in case I need to take the stairs . The staff are nice enough but not very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting with problems arise . Several times , I ' ve had issues with noise carrying from other rooms or parts of the hotel . Generally , it ' s not a great place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room and clean as well . Good service at check ##in , but the parking at Swiss ##ote ##l is terrible and expensive . 70 $ per . day . But you can use the parking next to the hotel , that will cost you half of what the hotel charge you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel and staff met my expectations . Great location , well maintained , excellent ##e service . All the staff with an excellent at ##itude . Food and beverages of good quality and acceptable price - value . All in a very good experience . I do recommend the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Outstanding hotel . Recently renovated . Off ##ers a lot of amenities , such as breakfast , and evening social . This hotel is in the heart of the North loop and you are within walking distance to a lot of sights , and shopping [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel . Room ##s are spacious and it is central ##ly located . P ##lent ##y to walk to but it ’ s also easy to U ##ber around . We went everywhere . Staff was excellent and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Bed ##s are a little firm but they worked for us . Co ##m ##fort ##er was soft . Hotel restaurant was del ##ish for breakfast ! Will stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] First visit to Chicago and hotel is located convenient ##ly above the First Lady cruise dock . Nice hotel but a bit dated . Staff are very helpful and professional . It was great the Market ( coffee shop ) opens 24 h ##rs and this is a plus for our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Ultra Modern hotel that is slightly over one year old with great amenities and location close to theaters , restaurants and bars . Vale ##t was quick ; w ##his ##ked away to 20th floor for check - in with awesome views of the city . Staff was court ##eous and knowledge ##able . Room ##s and views are awesome ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location , the room was spacious and clean , and we enjoyed the compliment ##ary breakfast and evening social . The rate was reasonable too , I will definitely stay here again and would high ##lt recommend especially if you want to be close to the Ma ##g Mile with all the great shops and restaurants . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is at a good location and the staff was great . Its location is very central to the city ' s most major attractions . There is a lot of good business spots within this hotel and the staff was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is located in a perfect spot to walk the ma ##g mile , the river walk , and even to Millennium Park . Great service . The bartender ##s on the roof top were exceptionally nice and fun ! ! The room was clean and had all of the amenities ! Great place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central location to top city attractions . A block away from the Art Institute and Millennium Park . The subway is right next door . This hotel has a lot of great history and if your able to do the tour . Ken Price is very knowledge ##able of the hotel . The room was a nice size room the shower head was very nice . But the bathroom was a big small but did it ' s job . Looking forward to doing again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here with my husband while on business . Room ##s are big . The bathroom was big too . The bathroom had a p ##edestal sink , but there was a small 3 shelf glass table to put your toilet ##ries on . The rooms were nice and quiet too . They did not have a pool , but do have a fitness center . This hotel is in a great location . It is within walking distance to the river and a lot of good restaurants and shopping . The staff was excellent and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly , class ##y hotel , well located for our family trip . We took our 7 and 8 year old for their first trip to Chicago . Sites were easily accessible through walking , bus and the L , as well as through cab . The con ##cier ##ge was knowledge ##able of kid - friendly destinations and restaurants . Hotel personnel were g ##rac ##ious and professional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent three nights in this hotel . The service was great , and location is ideal . We arrived very early in the morning and was so glad that the reception ##ist allowed us to checked into our room . Very clean room and has a good size bathroom . We love the happy hours with free beer , and wine . A value for money hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The pillows were awful and the comfort ##er was like a sheet in between two other sheets . The view was good . There didn ’ t seem to be any room service at all . I called ahead to in ##quire about a spa , as it was on the web ##page . I was told there was no spa . There used to be , but there wasn ’ t one anymore . When I arrived I saw in my room that they worked with a nearby spa . By then , I had booked a service at the fair ##mont next door , where I also wish I had stayed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for a Cubs game and stayed downtown at a different hotel , but went to the Columbus Ta ##p in the Fair ##mont for br ##unch on Saturday . We had an excellent meal and top notch service from Sam at the bar . A good choice for br ##unch and a cocktail if you ’ re in the area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] La ##tas ##ha ’ s assistance with our last minute trip was outstanding ! I genuinely appreciate her patience , grace , and willingness to provide quality service ! I would definitely visit again . Thank you , La ##tas ##ha ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love staying at the O ##m ##ni when we visit Chicago . Staff ( especially the v ##alet guys ) are extremely helpful and so pleasant ! The suites are room ##y and the bathroom ##s are much more spacious than most hotels ! Bar and service are great there too . Would like to see a better fitness center soon ! Overall would give this Hotel a 9 . 5 ! Stay ##ing there again in the next couple of weeks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This fine hotel is central ##ly located to many points of interest and across the street from the River ##walk . Staff was friendly and helpful . No need to rent a car from this location since walking and short cab rides will get you pretty much anywhere you want to go . The overnight parking rates make cab ##s the more affordable and stress free option . Would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My long over ##due review of the Talbot ##t Hotel : my husband and I in ##ex ##p ##lica ##bly , had never been to Chicago . Before heading to Wisconsin for a family wedding , we decided to visit . We had a great stay at the Talbot ##t . Before we arrived , we worked with the exceptional con ##cier ##ge staff to get Hamilton tickets , tickets for the architectural boat tour and restaurant reservations . The entire con ##cier ##ge staff , Gene , Tim and R ##oan ##a , went out of their way to make our visit memorable . Our room was spacious and comfortable , clean and the bathroom was huge ! The restaurant was great and the location very convenient to everything we did . The el was nearby , and we were able to walk or use mass transit with ease . We will definitely stay at the Talbot ##t on our next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Connie at the con ##cier ##ge lounge was the highlight of our stay . Very friendly with phenomena ##l service . The lounge is a great place to un ##wind , grab a light snack and a glass of wine . The view overlooking the river is amazing and only gets better at night ##fall . The hotel offers several nice restaurants as well as many food options within walking distance . Great location and great customer service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location at a great price , at least for downtown Chicago . Were stayed for 5 nights and didn ' t want to leave . We were fortunate to get a corner room with great views . The room was clean and spacious and the staff was very at ##ten ##tive . Breakfast was available every morning in each floor and there is a bar on the 6th floor where we had free drinks and app ##eti ##zers every evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , close to a lot of great stores and restaurants , all within walking distance . Hotel is nice and very clean as well . Just a tip : the hotel is actually on Huron St . We had to do a couple loops around Michigan Ave before finding it because it ’ s not well listed on the actual building . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at hotel Ki ##nz ##ie and while I did like the hotel and the employees , I was disappointed in the fact that parking wasn ##t included . This was my first time to a larger city and I was not expecting to pay 66 per night to park the car . The hotel was clean and they had happy hour for free and continental breakfast . I was happy with the overall stay and would stay again . Warning the stuff on the tray in the room is not free . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel will not di ##sa ##pp ##oint you . I had my room upgraded to the gold room . Which I had met the 4 amazing people in my life . They did not make you feel like a guest . So much more like family . Alexander M ##can ##dre ##ws , Man ##dan ##a Kay ##di , and T ##ip ##hani . They had the best hospitality in the world . They make you never want to leave the Fair ##mont ch ##ica ##go . Also huge shout out to Cody an amazing sweet person also . Make sure you say hi to them and for sure you will feel the same way I do as soon as you meet them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great ! My friends and I loved the hotel and the beautiful de ##cor ! We will be back in town soon and won ##t stay anywhere else . Tom the door ##man was so friendly ! Close to Michigan avenue and lots of places to shop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love being a Hilton Honors member because they always make me feel like royalty . We only stayed one night , but had the best time . Since we were able to extend our check out to 2 ##pm , it felt longer . Also , after check ##out we used the indoor pool , w ##hir ##l ##pool , and sa ##una ! Special thanks to the Custom ##er Service Coordinator , Robert Alma ##raz who had a bottle of wine waiting for us in our room . The turn down service is a great service to offer as well . I also want to give a shout out to Amanda at the front desk as well as Tiffany and Alicia who texted me just to make sure I had everything I needed . I plan on coming back soon ! Thank you all ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ’ t say enough good things about my stay at the Mill ##eni ##un K ##nick ##eb ##ock ##er Hotel . It was 5 star as far as I ’ m concerned . The room was very clean and comfortable . The staff from check in to bartender to waiter was excellent . I wouldn ’ t hesitate to stay with them again [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is a comfortable hotel in Chicago . We decided to stay there , although we had to go to the convention center , the McCormick Place , same days during our stay in Chicago . We use the Metro but had to walk some b ##loc ##s . No problem , and I ’ m sure we decided correct because the location of the hotel is great . It ’ s called Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . And the hotel ? Well , the hotel is also magnificent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upper scale hotel with v ##alet parking and continental breakfast ( extra cost ) . They have a happy hour with free wine and beer from 5 - 7 ##pm . So many restaurant choices within a few blocks . Nice beds and linen ##s . Dual shower head and flu ##ffy robes provided . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I checked into my room . I Had left to go out came back my key wasn ’ t working so I had went to the service desk for her to tell me I never checked in and someone told else was in my room while all my stuff was already in the room . When manager came she just smiled in my face like no big deal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently my husband and I visiting the United States from Australia . We spent the 4th July 2017 with friends at this hotel . Great location , welcome drinks and ni ##bble ##s . . . . Clean and modern rooms . The staff at this hotel were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Especially the door ##man " RAF ##I " I must give him a great review , he couldn ' t do enough for us as we arrived and on our departure . Thank you very much it was a very pleasant stay We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one night on a business trip . The location is great , in downtown Chicago . But the hotel is in bad need of a re ##furbishment . The staff is ok but not a smile in sight . Breakfast good but over ##p ##rice ##d . I would definitely not recommend , there are better options around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel very convenient ##ly situated to see all the sights . Dec ##oration is very nice . The rooms are spacious and we had a view of the river Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary tea and coffee in the mornings and wine in the afternoon ##s . Can ’ t fault it . Everybody were very friendly [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not worth what you pay for . Not a very “ exciting ” room for how expensive it was ! The only outlets we could find were in the bathroom . Was very clean and well kept . Just figured there would be more to it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was friendly and nice from the moment we arrived . Plan ##e landed a bit earlier than expected ( 7 : 30 ##am ) and was able to check super early . Had a great view ! The location of this property is super convenient . Would definitely stay at this H ##ya ##tt again : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here during Christmas 2018 and I was expecting an ups ##cale property seeing that it ' s the Fair ##mont . It was definitely not so . The entrance and main lobby are nice but the rooms are run down and d ##rab . Whether its the base ##boards , the walls , the furniture . I asked to move rooms because the first one was just too gross ( there was what appeared to be mold in the bathroom ##s and everything looked very old ) . The second room was a bit better but still wasn ' t very nice . Overall , it just felt old , run ##down and de ##pressing . It ' s nice on the outside but the rooms need a serious renovation or update . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location downtown for walking the city . We were greeted by the Vale ##t - Mir ##ham . What a wonderful first impression he makes for the hotel . So welcoming . Our front desk check in was just as impressive . Alison Bo ##tt ##ner was professional and efficient and jumped from behind the desk over to the con ##sie ##rge to help us book tickets for one of our daily adventures . Alison must have made a note when I told her it was our anniversary because when we returned to our room in the afternoon a sweet treat with an anniversary card was delivered . What a nice touch ! The hotel room was one of the cool ##est layout ##s we have ever had in hotel . We had such a wonderful experience , we hope to go back ! You can ' t match the service at the O ##m ##ni ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Park ##ing costs ridiculous use park w ##hi ##z for a better rate . I don ' t understand all the h ##ype it is a lipstick on the old ambassador pig . The comments areas are well done . Room ##s aren ' t even big enough to change your mind in . Art is odd , one 4 ##x ##6 on the right side of the head ##board . Just skip it . I wouldn ' t stay here again . Over ##rated over ##p ##rice ##d [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a work event and could not be happier with the accommodation ##s . From the room itself to the conference rooms we used for our event , it was easy to navigate , clean and the staff was super helpful . Will definitely be on my list to re ##vis ##it next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of our Route 66 journey . The entrance to the hotel is beautiful . . totally breath ##taking . The staff are extremely helpful , in particular one of the con ##cier ##ges , Robert was very know ##led ##gable . Our room , however , was quite disappointing and certainly not 4 star standard . Wall ##paper was p ##eel ##ing off in several areas of the room and there were no tea or coffee making facilities . The clean ##liness of the bathroom was lacking too . . the same hair was on the edge of the bath at the start of our stay and was still there when we left ! ! Rather a disappointing start to such a special trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My mother and I visited this hotel in 2014 . The bell ##men and con ##cier ##ge were always helpful and kind . The room was comfortable but not excessive . The atmosphere was warm and inviting . Breakfast in the restaurant is very over ##p ##rice ##d , but the food was good . We did not have to worry about safety issues . We were in walking distance to amazing shops on Michigan Avenue without the price of being on Michigan Avenue . A ##ff ##ord ##able and beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price you will not find a better hotel . The building is beautiful , the staff wonderful and the food delicious . Great location for walking and is centered in a great neighborhood . If you are in Chicago stay s ##t The Public ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the old de ##cor at the Talbot . Sad to see all of the pretty old hotels strip ##ping down to appear modern like the others . However , The Talbot is central ##ly located , clean , com ##fy and the staff are so kind . It is a smaller hotel and feels like a home away from home . The food is very good in the restaurant and room service . The lobby is co ##zy . A great value in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for tourists . The staff were helpful and friendly . We were on the top floor so view was great . The suite was large , very comfortable and extremely clean . We ate breakfast in the hotel which was good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time staying at a Home ##wood Suite ##s . The compliment ##ary breakfast included hot foods like bacon and eggs and also fresh fruit . The compliment ##ary evening social was not go ##ur ##met , but not bad - chicken , hot ##dog ##s , salad ##s . The location was great . Suite included full kitchen . Overall , a very good deal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I agree with another reviewer who said the rooms are super tight and seem like very old spaces with a new coat of paint , but not much else . The elevators are super " sketch ##y " and make odd noises which caused concern for me . The hallway ##s , at least on the 17th floor , were super dark , black everywhere , and overall it just set the scene for an old , din ##gy , and even s ##po ##ok ##y experience . However , the daily cocktail hour was a nice touch , the lobby areas were very neatly decorated , and the bartender ( male ) was very sweet . I was super tired after a long day of work and he was kind enough to make sure I had what I needed as I took my drink to my room fairly quickly after he poured it , meaning plenty of wine to help me un ##wind and rest ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first experience staying in Chicago for a business trip . The H ##ya ##tt was beautiful , clean , and situated within walking distance to the river ##front . The hotel staff was helpful and court ##eous . My room was comfortable , well - appointed , and clean . My room looked over the city rather than the river ##front . Other than hearing emergency vehicles on the road and other guests in the hallway passing by , the room was very quiet and comfortable . I enjoyed my stay in Chicago very much ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was double charged for the room I pre ##pa ##id for . After arguing with a front desk staff member , I finally got a hold of a manager who apologized and reversed the charge . The manager also gave me a free upgrade . Upon arrival and during my stay the Vale ##t staff was AM ##A ##Z ##ING . During my stay House ##keeping staff was AM ##A ##Z ##ING . They turned my few mi ##sha ##ps into a better stay . Thanks [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago is an amazing and welcoming property . The staff are very friendly and a ##cco ##mada ##ting . We were upgraded to the ' Chicago suite ' # 141 ##7 . upon check inn . This room is very spacious and elegant . As gold hilt ##on members we re ##cie ##ved a free upgraded breakfast at Baptiste and Bo ##ttle ( on ##site restaurant ) . It is very cold in Chicago so the only thing i would change is the ability to adjust the the ##rm ##ost ##at above 80 degrees . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very pretty hotel . Bell staff and bar staff are very friendly . Check out and in is very quick . Got an early check ##in no questions asked ! ! Clean and luxurious ! It is close to shopping , restaurants and the lake . It is also close to other tourist attractions that we didn ' t do ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel ' s location in the Gold Coast area of Chicago is ups ##cale , lots of restaurants and a couple of blocks away from shopping on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The hotel had a complete make ##over in 2017 and the new de ##cor is modern and ups ##cale . We stayed on the 10th floor facing the street after being given a compliment ##ary upgrade . The de ##cor was modern and plus ##h and the room surprisingly quiet . Our only minor complaint was the low platform bed and very low couch that are not so easy to get in and out of if you are 6 ' 3 [SEP]
1	[CLS] First the staff are very good . I was on the 15th floor East Tower and the carpet was clean , but as slick as my bald head . The parking at the Hotel exceeded $ 65 per night . The conference I attended had lots of people , so much so that the elevators and es ##cal ##ators were overwhelmed as much as Chicago ' s Lakes ##hore Drive during rush hour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a great find . Well located with helpful staff and a very clean room . Our basic room was small but adequate . The bathroom was well equipped and compact . We ate a late dinner upon arrival and breakfast the next morning at the restaurant . Both meals were good with at ##ten ##tive service . We stayed one night on our way to Europe after flying into Midway . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If your rich or a business man then this is your hotel . The room was great . I had to repeatedly ask for coffee and milk which seemed to never make it to my room . I also had to get a new mattress after there was stain ##s on it and it was really lump ##y . The food was ok . Breakfast ##s were brilliant the the con ##cier ##ge were brilliant . Re ##ception staff were hit and miss and some were rude . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent a few nights at the lovely So ##fit ##el in late July while visiting family in the area . They did an amazing job of ins ##ti ##tu ##ting in - depth safety procedures without making guests feel uncomfortable or un ##we ##l ##come - - in my experience , this can be a hard mark to hit . We loved the convenient location and comfortable rooms . During our stay , we enjoyed both their dining room and bar and noted the spaced out seating to allow di ##stan ##cing and the thorough cleaning of tables after guests departed . It was a truly delight ##ful stay and I con ##gra ##tu ##late the g ##rac ##ious staff for both their hospitality and their attention to safety . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this Hotel ! Location , F ##ac ##ilities , Pool , Staff all excellent ! I came for a trip with Ni ##ec ##e and Sister . We had an amazing experience . Whole Foods right around the corner ! We also loved The Wine Bar and Star ##bu ##cks ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Beautiful , convenient only began to describe One ' s experience at The Conrad Chicago . The marriage of fantastic staff / management with on of the most elegant properties in North America , Hilton has created a harm ##oni ##ous atmosphere of comfort , so ##phi ##stic ##ation and el ##egan ##ce with The Conrad Chicago . No question the best hotel in Chicago . . . I still love The Palmer House ( I have stayed there for the past 35 years ) . However after experiencing the Conrad , it has become my first choice when traveling to Chicago . Thank you and good selling , Stephen A . Head [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is very convenient to the Red Line L Train stop Grand / State . Very friendly staff , great breakfast and a 24 hour coffee station with good coffee cream ##er . You can take the Orange line L train from Midway and switch to the Red Line at Roosevelt to Grand / State for $ 3 . 00 . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Bo ##uti ##que hotel feel with friendly service . Staff were a great assist with all our questions and concerns . The room was clean and well appointed . The food in the restaurant was delicious and p ##lent ##iful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is right next to millennium park and the River . Friendly staff . Our room was spacious and had a great view of the parks . Compared to other nearby hotels . . . this place generally has more square footage per room . The walls are thick and the rooms are very comfortable and quiet & private . Just minutes walk to P ##ritz ##ker Pavilion and Maggie Dale ##y kids Park . They have a bar and restaurant in the lobby and you have endless food choices nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hotel is close to everything river North and beyond ! Steps from the mile and amidst some of the best restaurants in Chicago . Staff are extremely friendly and will assist with everything from directions to restaurant reservations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is located right in the heart of the shopping center of Chicago , near many restaurants and about a 15 minute walk from Millennium Park . The rooms are fine but it ' s big and imp ##erson ##al . You also have to take an elevator to the third floor , which is the lobby , and then another elevator to your floor . If you have a car , make sure you book the rate with the free v ##alet service , or else you will be charged $ 70 a night for parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s my second time to stay here , great location and excellent service by the staff , shout out to Man ##dan ##a at the Fair ##mont gold lounge for her above & beyond service . She made sure that we had a good start of the day everyday . . . definitely coming back and will recommend the hotel to my friends and family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I arrived in Chicago aboard the South Shore from South Bend and arrived at the Conrad around 11 ##am . We were greeted promptly and w ##his ##ked to the check - in desk to find that our King executive room was ready ! ! The room was spectacular with a great view of Michigan Avenue from the 17th floor . Very modern with push button switches for the lights and even the curtains ! The location just a half block from Michigan Avenue makes it a great location for restaurants and shopping ! Room service was a great way to start the morning and they even delivered a bottle of champagne for my birthday ! The con ##cier ##ge was able to get us tickets for Al ##ad ##din at a great price ! All in all a great way to spend the weekend ! Would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and very friendly and helpful staff , nice clean comfortable room . Great bed and pillows , and good continental breakfast , I would stay here again . . . . . . Downs ##ides were that the maid service came at 5 ##pm so we declined as we had been out for most of the day , room service was slow ( 40 minutes ) and the food was warm to cold , no k ##ett ##le so have to use coffee machine that doesn ' t make a real hot cup of tea . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in this hotel for a business purpose and was satisfied with the service ! Check - in was quick . The room I got was on the 17th and it was definitely perfect - - nice view and the room has all the stuff that I need ( toilet is loaded with all the basic ##s ) . The bed and comfort ##er were very comfortable - - I slept so good after a conference that day . The location is right in the central part of Chicago so going out at night would be convenient from here . Park ##ing is really price ##y ( like in any hotels ) so if you want to save , park somewhere nearby . I will definitely come back in this hotel again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a huge property , without the infrastructure and people required to service so many people . Long waits everywhere - Check - in / check out , elevators , con ##cier ##ge , etc . The staff were all quite friendly but obviously stretched and it takes a fair amount of time to get any attention . Our room was Ok but had no view and looked onto the opposite wall . The gym was huge and well equipped . Overall the hotel felt functional and somewhat soul ##less . No real complaints , does the job , just don ' t expect anything special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always enjoy my stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . It ' s a nice hotel with a great location just off the Main Street . Within walking distance of the beach as well . The hotel is always clean well maintained . In the room they give you access to a PC as well giving you access to local information . The room feels slightly on the small side for an American room but still is a great room . There ' s no room service but a large amount of local food companies that will deliver . The bar area is great with friendly bar tender ##s a great place to sit for evening drinks [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great experience when we got a room for our international friends . En ##joy ##ed the am ##bian ##ce and friendly staff . Great room service food and super ta ##sty desert ##s ! Location couldn ' t be better . Great choice ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is very ideal for shopping and attending the Jo ##ff ##rey ballet . The door ##man are incredibly kind and helpful , as are the individuals at the front desk . Unfortunately , the pool area was not open during this trip . The lobby is absolutely beautiful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very quiet , but yet so close to restaurants , shopping , and Lake Michigan . Great neighborhood for walking around . Our room was wonderful and the staff was exceptional . Would highly recommend staying at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was at the hotel yesterday for an event . Sergio came to the 42nd floor and helped me load all my equipment and walked me to the v ##alet . My car wasn ' t going to be there for 20 minutes because they were backed up . He stayed with me the whole time . He was amazing . I ' ve never had service like this . Such a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a weekend get together with old friends , at a decent group rate . Wonderful location with pleasant , if rather over ##p ##rice ##d , bar and steak restaurant ( " Shu ##la ' s ) . The lobby is huge with plenty of seating . My room was large and comfortable but no microwave or fridge . It was on a high floor ; elevator service was slow . I was sorry not to have a view of the river . The electronic key on the Mar ##riot ##t app didn ' t always work , so I got a real key from the front desk . All in all , a satisfactory experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is in great area . But the beds and pillows are both S ##O hard . Te ##rrible night sleep . Bring your own pillows if you come . These are huge , heavy , and hard pillows . Matt ##ress is super firm also . Park ##ing ramp fills up to capacity , so you will need to park nearby without in / out privileges . ( Weekend ) expect $ 50 for overnight parking . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a work trip and as I had to prepare for several presentations . The service was the best ! I don ’ t have a great status with them but they accommodate ##d me the entire way . For example , the morning shift cleaning maid forgot to clean my room . Once i reported it , a maid came up in less than 10 min ##s and cleaned [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the old Conrad a few times years ago . This was our first time at the new location . The rooms were very comfortable and modern as I suppose it should be as its only a year plus old . The lobby is not on the ground floor and there is a large spacious lobby area adjacent to the registration desk with beautiful views , the coffee shop / restaurant on the lobby level was ok but not great . We get a free breakfast for our Hilton per ##k but there are better places within a few blocks . Service was as expected for a Conrad excellent . Location is good . Using the parking apps we got a great place just 2 blocks away for a fraction of the price of v ##alet parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly bout ##ique hotel in a magnificent neighborhood , the Gold Coast . Room ##s were partially modern ##ized , a bit on the small size , but comfortable with a very comfortable bed , which was a bit low . Large walk in closet and modern ##ized bathroom . The service is pretty good , the am ##bie ##nce in the lobby and lounge was quite ch ##ic . Great location for walking in north Chicago , Lincoln park , and quick ride to other areas . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A prime hotel right in the heart of the theater area . Small rooms , but that ' s to be expected in classic hotels in big , old cities like Chicago , NY , Boston , etc . Good amenities , and plenty of helpful businesses nearby , like drug stores and Du ##nk ##in Don ##uts . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m regularly in Chicago for work , and this is my go - to hotel . It just works so well , from the front desk to the con ##cier ##ge ( a great service which this hotel ex ##cel ##s at ) to the do ##jo staff . On this trip I stayed on one of the Fair ##mont Gold floors to avail myself of the breakfast ##s . The staff were so kind and helpful , it really helped me start my day . Can ' t wait to come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay at the Ambassador Chicago ! The hotel is beautiful ! Our rooms were com ##fy and inviting . The bed was comfortable . The location was perfect for walking , shopping and dining . We received the best from the v ##alet and front desk staff ( Ken ##zie and Mary Jo ) . I highly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small rooms yes , but the de ##cor is very nice and new . But the staff made the trip , we were there for 6 nights with a 3 and 6 year old . They couldn ' t have been nice ##r to them , remembering them everyone they walked in the door and even had a kids toy box for the boys to pick out of . We especially loved Co ##rie , thank you so much for making the boys stay amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was lucky to stay here during the AS ##CO conference . It is a great location , particularly if you want to take a break and run in neighborhoods . Hotel is what I expect for business trip , service is very good . There were some bill ##ing issues this time that I am working on with the property , which is why this is not a 5 star rating . But happy that the property is helpful and customer focused . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel ! Standard room was spacious and quiet . Very comfortable beds . En ##joy ##ed breakfast ( although $ 7 for corn fl ##akes was over the top ) and the ma ##rt ##ini bar . The staff couldn ’ t have been nice ##r or more friendly . Great location very close to Michigan Ave . Bath ##rooms are updated and clean , but could use much better lighting . Some furniture in the lounge area is worn . Too ##k awhile for v ##alet to bring our car , but there was more than usual congestion in front of the hotel at the time . Overall , a good place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of our favorite hotels ! Historic and a great location on Michigan Avenue ! Jordan ##s is f ##abulous . The parade was right in front which was spectacular . From the welcome by Eva with a glass of Rose ’ till our departure our time spent was perfect ! Thank you I ##CH [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect in every ##way ! Location , the staff was outstanding , the room was insane ! We won ' t stay anywhere else in the future ! I was excited to stay here , it looked so great on line , but you never know . It exceeded my expectations for sure ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ' t speak to everything as I was not on site . My understanding is that the event went off , without any issues . Having never hosted there before , more information up front would have been helpful , 1 ) who ' s our point of contact while we are there , if we have issues , 2 ) who ' s handling the catering , 3 ) who do we contact if the A ##V isn ' t working . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are old . No hot water . Need ##s an update . Had to take a cold shower . Room could use and update . It ’ s older but in a good location . No longer really a 4 diamond experience . I probably wouldn ’ t go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had the best experience . The room was quite like home . Good kitchen to travel with kids . Social evenings were great , . However my son and I are c ##eli ##ac and the hotel doesn ##t have any g ##lut ##en free options that was di ##ssa ##point ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , wonderful staff . Our only mi ##sha ##p occurred with my wife using the business center during the day . It is an open area on the me ##zza ##nine , and even though it was tucked in the corner right next to her , my wife ' s purse was stolen in broad daylight . The hotel was very pro ##mpt in assisting , reviewed the security ca ##m to catch the images , and the police found the purse gut ##ted in a next ##do ##or alley . Don ' t get me wrong , we do not blame the hotel , but it is in ##dicative that it is easy for folks to l ##inger around looking to steal items from the customers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at the Talbot ##t in its previous incarnation , back in 2003 , when it was rather s ##hab ##by and tired . The current renovation is quite nice and taste ##ful . The bed ##ding leaves something to be desired ( I hate du ##vet ##s and had to remake the bed myself with a blanket ) , but overall the room had everything one would need . The bathroom was well - appointed with an excellent room ##y shower , hooks for robes and adequate storage . The location on E . Delaware could not be more convenient ! It ' s a great hotel for a single woman travel ##er . . . the con ##cier ##ge ' s desk faces the front door , so it felt very safe . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have done several meetings with the Fair ##mont Chicago and recently had the pleasure of staying for a personal trip and always have a wonderful experience there ! The staff is all friendly and helpful and our CS ##M , Nina M . , is by far the most kind and genuinely helpful person I ' ve worked with . It is always a pleasure to return to the hotel - - I ' m already looking forward to my next trip there ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband booked a river view room for an overnight stay for my birthday . It was amazing . We had arrived a little early , and the gentleman at the front desk , had said our room wasn ' t ready yet , about 30 minutes . He apologized , and said he would contact us , when it was ready . We were okay with this , an occasion to have a drink in the lobby . Our server was very nice . We went up the the front , to see if we were ready , and he then gave us our luggage , and informed us , he had done a change . The change , was an upgrade . It was a lake view , j ##r suite . Could not have been better . We would definitely go back for another stay ##cation . Thanks again for an incredible weekend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had pleasant stay . Location was good , loved the complementary breakfast . Especially this location loved it more . Their Thanksgiving dinner was A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E . it was very home ##ly and Ser ##ving staff were amazing . We had a bit of problem on the black Friday in suite service . Otherwise overall very nice experience for me and my family [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is by far one of the worst She ##rato ##n ' s I have stayed at : : Really old and anti ##qua ##ted rooms , poor furnishings . Furthermore , as a platinum member the lounge was lacking . Breakfast lacked anything but eggs , no apple , banana and orange ##s . Overall , I would not stay here again . Last , but not least don ' t park your car in their lot , they are quite di ##sor ##ganized as it too me 45 minutes to get my car . Never again staying here , not even if it was free . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very pretty lobby , but the rooms are me ##h . Nothing special . V ##ER ##Y expensive little shop area . Okay restaurant , fancy , nothing like a normal cheese ##burg ##er . W ##if ##i not free . Something crazy like $ 15 a day . And every ##time I wanted room service it wasn ##t available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at The Talbot ##t while in town for the Pearl Jam concert this past weekend . I was looking for something nice with a little charm and this property checked all the boxes . The reception , bar and restaurant staff were all extremely helpful , friendly and at ##ten ##tive . The room was im ##ma ##culate and very comfortable - even if 3 of the 4 sides of the hotel face another building . The real stand ##out for the property is Charles , the Door ##man . You can tell this fine gentleman views Delaware Place as his domain and controls the commotion with an infectious smile and a razor sharp wit to match . We ate breakfast outside the day we left just to ch ##it chat with him and watch him hold court ! Overall great stay - will be returning regularly ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador has been the best hotels I ’ ve stayed in by far , the staff is super helpful , very educated on the night life and best restaurants around . The bell hop Is ##hm ##ae ##el was outstanding . Will return soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have been here several times before . The service and accommodation ##s are always excellent . We enjoyed the new renovations that have taken place since our last stay . This will not be our last . Looking forward to our next trip to Chicago which will include the Talbot ##t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 3 nights , the hotel is close to the train station which we used from the airport . It ’ s in a great location , close to downtown and L train stations are right outside . The hotel was clean , we had a double room , the rooms are out ##dated but this didn ’ t affect the clean ##liness . Staff all very friendly and helpful , we asked for an additional pillow and this was no problem to them at all . There is free W ##i ##F ##i in the lobby area but this doesn ’ t reach to the rooms . Overall a very pleasant stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice property with fantastic location near museums , shopping , restaurants . Next to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile The hotel has all the facilities and great customer service . they a ##com ##mo ##date you as much as they can . Always with smile ready to help , and sincere concern that you are happy and con ##fort ##able . Also at the property there is St ##ets ##on , a steak restaurant , f ##abulous , great steak ##s and service . Ask for a room with a view [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would have enjoyed access to am ##ene ##ties ( pump room - restaurant , the library - bar , lounge ) . Would not recommend staying here during holiday season due to private parties taking priority over guests - why both am ##ene ##ties closed . Nice location to old town , l ##in ##co ##ln park . Room was simple and certainly relaxing , but I will seek other moderate priced hotel in future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel worked well for a 3 night stay , very friendly and efficient staff , nice atmosphere , good size rooms . i would suggest a room on higher floor if you want to avoid too much road noise as it is in a very busy area . the con ##cier ##ge was extremely helpful in booking tours and dinner ##s . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago is the perfect accommodation for your visit to downtown Chicago . The facilities are beautiful , but the hotel ' s outstanding feature is staff . From Michael , the delight ##ful door ##man to Beverly , the pleasant guest services representative who helped me with my dry cleaning . The She ##rato ##n staff works hard to make your stay a pleasure . Over the years I have stayed in nearly a dozen of the downtown Chicago hotels . The She ##rato ##n Grand remains my favorite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had 2 rooms one for my son & the other for us . Both rooms were excellent . We also like the bathroom ##s & the shower ##s . The hotel is located in the Gold cost close to Division Street . My father , brother & some friends meet us for dinner @ the P ##ump Room . The food options were nice , the waiter ' s presentation had us sa ##liva ##ting . We had an excellent meal ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t to Chicago for a recent meeting . This hotel was on the list for shuttle service to the meeting . Very nice room with king bed . Only thing I did not like was having to take 2 elevators . One from ground floor entry to check in then from third floor check in another elevator to rooms . St ##uff was very friendly . Room ##s very clean . For a big city very reasonable rate . Would likely stay again as had great location to shopping and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We brought our whole family to Chicago and stayed for a couple of days and the Talbot ##t was an excellent hotel . The staff was amazing , our room was spacious and clean . Bar and Rest ##ura ##nt in lobby area was inviting and fun . Location was perfect for all of the downtown attractions . When we come this way again we will book this hotel again ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] If you need a place to stay in Chicago that is convenient to buses , trains , shopping and the Ma ##g Mile , this is it . The room was clean among other things . Very comfortable beds and nice linen ##s , lots of lighting , plenty of mirrors and storage and F ##RE ##E w ##i - fi . The bathroom was everything we were looking for : bath ##robe ##s , plenty of counter space , H ##20 products , and dual shower heads . Extra bonus was F ##RE ##E continental breakfast that was very sufficient and a ' Happy Hour ' with drinks and app ##eti ##zers ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly will stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d our stay at this hotel just tucked away off the magnificent mile and rush street area . Quiet and co ##zy for a winter stay . The library cocktail lounge was beautiful to enjoy a pre dinner drink or coffee in the morning . First time also to the pump room restaurant and it was fantastic - - food , am ##bian ##ce and service were perfect for a romantic evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , great location and comfortable rooms . Bed ##s are so soft and I had a lovely night sleep ! Very limited contact with staff and the hotel is quiet at the moment so easy to socially distance within the hotel . Thank you for a lovely stay . [SEP]

1	[CLS] From Check - in to Check Out , this hotel tops them all . Check - in goes quite well . Room Service was outstanding for service and the food , as well as the Michael Jordan Restaurant service and food . The guest rooms are very clean and very well maintained . The Bell Staff was very helpful with directions and arranging transportation . Will was standing outside in the rain but made certain that we had a taxi to get to our meeting . After our meeting he helped us with transportation to the Blue Line to get home . This hotel is one of the best in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This wasn ' t our first stay at this hotel and it certainly won ' t be our last . You can ' t beat the spacious one - bedroom suites for families and the staff and location are really good too . The free breakfast has something for everyone - - even our to ##ddler enjoyed the plain Ch ##eer ##ios . ( Thank you for having those ! ! ! ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here for a little weekend get ##away and it did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! From the moment you step out of your vehicle the staff were so at ##ten ##tive and friendly . The lobby / lounge area is beautiful ! The room was perfect and the bathroom had a very spacious double sink which was very nice . P ##lent ##y of amenities in the room had us feeling right at home . Had a nice view of Michigan avenue . The bed was so com ##fy , we didn ' t want to get up ! I am also partial to the smell of " new " . . . so with all that being said this is my new favorite Hilton property in Chicago ! We will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel . Front desk so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The rooms are pretty especially facing the street . Beautiful window seats and very com ##fy beds . Love ##d the bar . The house ##keeping is a little lacking but not terrible . I would def stay again . [SEP]

0	[CLS] Sit ##uated north of where we usually stay in Chicago , the Public Hotel surprised us with a price and rewarded us with excellent accommodation ##s . Room ##s are clean and comfortable , decent size , looks like they were recently re ##nn ##ova ##ted along with the common areas . Overall we recommend staying at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was great . This was my 2nd visit there and the staff is friendly and court ##eous and the rooms are spacious and clean and modern . The hotel is in a great location and central to everything in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were extremely satisfied with the location on the river and views ! It was walking distance to downtown and Navy Pier ! The customer service people were very friendly and remembered us by last name , impression ##able . We booked the hotel with the notion that there was a pool . When checking in , they stated it had been gone for a year . Us girls and our teenagers were very disappointed . This should be updated on websites and with travel agents . Other than that it was great experience ! We would stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we arrived we were greeted with smiles and friendly staff . We pulled up to the hotel at 11 ##am and did not expect our room to be ready however . . . . it was ! Not only was it ready we got the 12th floor and had a nice view of the lake . The front desk also gave us two v ##ou ##chers for breakfast at the restaurant and the Martin ##i Bar . The room was clean and the in room computer was playing classical music as you arrive . IT WA ##S A L ##O ##VE ##L ##Y TO ##UC ##H ! The rain shower was great ! The entire stay was top notch and we will be back soon as we can . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have mixed feelings about this hotel . It ' s neat with the art , redesigned older b ##ld ##g , etc . but the rooms are tiny , the elevators are slow , and I could care less about a yoga mat and ch ##ee ##tah robe . I did enjoy the free wine at happy hour though . On a side note , during our stay the hotel staff gave my colleague a key to someone else ' s room . . . that story didn ' t end well ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient location since we were there in March for The International Home and House ##ware ##s show at the McCormick Place convention Centre . Walking distance to lakes ##ide restaurants . Hotel lobby and our room was very clean . The bed and pillows were very comfortable . No complaints about the service . The con ##cier ##ge was very helpful finding and re ##ser ##ving restaurants for dinner . I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Walking in to this ma ##rve ##lous hotel in Chicago , you would think you happened upon the Ta ##j Ma ##hal . Hotel staff couldn ' t have been more a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We were told our room would not be ready as it was being inspected . No problem since luggage could be locked away . Reason I gave 3 stars is that I WA ##NT a clean bathroom . A dirty towel hung on bar in shower area and a long black hair was on ceiling . G ##ag . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just stayed one night as part of H ##ya ##tt Re ##ward ##s free night . The location was close to Ma ##g Mile , Art Institute , and we also enjoyed the Christ ##kind ##le Market experience . . . despite the rain . We walked to the AMC theater on Illinois , then over to Michigan Avenue of some shopping , and later to the Art Institute . I would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Hilton Chicago during a conference held in the hotel . It is a beautiful hotel with great rooms and great conference spaces . I had a room up in the higher Executive levels . Got a room with a nice view of Lake Michigan . Service was great . Room was nice , bed was com ##fy . I really liked the little i ##Pad like devices in the room that had all the information about the hotel amenities and services as well as surrounding places to eat and attractions . Between the cafe , in - hotel restaurants , everything you need is right there . De ##fin ##ite ##ly would stay here again if ever in Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I must admit , the location of the hotel is great . And the reception is g ##rea ##r as well . But the pricing of the rooms is ridiculous . So over ##p ##rice ##d . Old room , small bathroom , an very dusty . The cleaning ladies really do their best , but it stays old . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel 3 weeks before new years eve and lived every minute . My husband and I stayed one night in a corner suite in room 229 and it was amazing . Great view , amenities and the night reception and Continental breakfast was pretty nice . Could not have asked for a better time and stay , will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were pleasant ##ly surprised by the feeling of classic luxury upon entering the hotel and our room . A ch ##ais ##e lounge in the corner , robes in the bathroom , and a great view of the river made for a very pleasant stay . The staff are friendly and at ##ten ##tive . A free wine bar is offered in the evening . The hotel is close to the water for those who enjoy a s ##tro ##ll along the River Walk . P ##lent ##y to see , do , and eat within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The only good thing this hotel has going for them is the location . . . . other than that rooms were very small , dated and must ##y for the Intercontinental Brand . I ’ m an I ##H ##G P ##lat member and have been to many Inter ##con hotels around the world . . . the bra ##n has been starting to go downhill . . . Park ##ing was also very high . G ##ym and pool are dated . There are so many nice and updated hotels in the area that I will not be staying at the inter ##continent ##al in Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great , close to everything : restaurants , bars , shopping , and sights ##ee ##ing . Hotel is recently re ##mo ##del ##ed , contemporary designed , clean , with good amenities . Free continental breakfast will get you going . Happy hour reception is very nice , good break between day and night activities . Be prepared to pay a he ##fty fee for the parking . Otherwise it was a great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay on the whole . I thought the bathroom was very well designed . It is great to be able to shower and have a place for one ' s soap ##s , lot ##ions and pot ##ions , and be under a shower with good water pressure too . The room layout was helpful too , especially suited to people sharing a room for work with two good sized double beds . I was a little confused about how bond was taken out from my credit card for each night . The way the item hit my credit card was confusing and made it difficult to budget . Generally , all good though and Swiss ##ote ##l compares well with the other conference hotels . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very disappointed I am very disappointed with the H ##ya ##tt hotel Chicago . The room was very dirty and I found a bug in the bath ##tub . When I did the reservation they told me that the breakfast is included in the price and when I was there the breakfast wasn ’ t wasn ’ t included . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' d say that this hotel was adequate . I ' d checked in using the Mar ##riot ##t app , so the process of getting my keys was easy , although the front desk staff wasn ' t particularly speed ##y . The room was fine . The bathroom was OK with painted tile in the shower / tub and a big counter . The sink didn ' t drain well . Bed was comfortable but I heard a decent amount of noise while I tried to sleep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an absolutely beautiful hotel . We much enjoyed the large pool , sa ##una and gigantic fitness center with indoor running track . Ya ##as ##mee ##n at the front desk was in particular helpful and truly made our stay very much enjoyable , she went above and beyond on several requests . Good beds , historic halls and ballroom and good food make this hotel a g ##em . Of note : it is close to the Field museum and She ##dd A ##qua ##rium and a ( roughly ) 20 - 30 min walk will get you to the loop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I were here for a martial arts tournament . This hotel is a great venue , especially for such a large tournament . The competition area that was set up for the tournament had ample space . The main lobby of the hotel was a great place to relax while waiting for my son to compete . Guest rooms are nice , clean , and quiet . Staff is friendly . Great location right on the river . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every single staff member I encountered was kind and friendly , and I give this O ##m ##ni hotel my highest marks . The room was top notch and very clean as expected . The thing that really speaks to me is that almost every employee that I encountered was very friendly and either said hello or asked how my day was going . It really makes you feel comfortable . The door ##men were awesome as always and extremely professional . Restaurant and bar were top notch as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Having a fantastic time here in Chicago . With the addition of this great hotel my time here es ##c ##lated drastically . The room is clean . Each room has a great view . The staff is welcoming and always 3 steps ahead of us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 2 nights over the Labor Day weekend at the Fair ##mont Chicago . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located a couple of blocks off of Michigan Avenue and near all the action of Millennium and Grant Parks , my 12th floor room offered most of what you would expect for a 4 star hotel but al ##as , no free internet . The view overlooked the Ra ##dis ##son Blu hotel pool across the street and the stay was pleasant with a large flat screen television and a king - sized bed . The separate sofa in front of the window was great for a late afternoon nap after a day of museum hop ##ping . Overall , a good stay at the Fair ##mont . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro due to its location . During our visit we went to the Cadillac Palace Theatre twice and were so happy to have found a great hotel so close . We left our car to v ##alet parking and got it at the end of our trip . The hotel has a f ##abulous de ##cor and the rooms are very nice , though small . If we were to visit this area of Chicago again , we would certainly stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We felt extremely welcomed im ##edia ##tel ##y . The facility is beautiful , the room was spacious and clean , and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable . The downtown location is ideal for walking around the river ##walk , Mill ##eni ##um Park , and close to transport to take you anywhere else you want to go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are compact but comfortable . All you need for a stay in the city ! Quiet Street Great Sleep Great Show ##er . Wonderful Staff - especially the Con ##cier ##ge and Bar Manager . Wen ##t above and beyond for me . Very convenient to Michigan Ave and within a nice long walk to Millennium Park and great Museums [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love Kim ##pton Hotels but am disappointed in Hotel All ##egro . My room is must ##y and I can hear my neighbors . I asked for a fan and was told they would need to go buy one and it would take 90 minutes . There is a tray of rotting food by the ice ##maker on floor 16 . Not the usual Kim ##pton standard . Lo ##bby is beautiful and location is convenient . Go with Monaco or Pa ##lo ##mar instead . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I returned to Chicago for a week in July . The hotel had a kitchen and so we chose it was chosen for that reason . We booked a corner king room and let me say the view was outstanding . If you want a room with a view , it doesn ' t get much better . The room had just been red ##one and was im ##ma ##culate . Michael at the front desk was very helpful and highly professional . The hotel was very busy and the room was never cleaned till very late in the day , in fact one day it not get cleaned it all which really was not an issue for me . Finally the location could not be beat . Excellent value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##NI ##C ##KE ##RB ##OC ##KE ##R offers a great stay in a great location . You will right at home relaxing in the MA ##RT ##IN ##I BA ##R with Bart ##ender Steve and his staff . The location allows you to shop and din ##e in a great part of the city . The d ##é ##cor is perfect for being in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The historic Intercontinental Hotel on Michigan Avenue , is a comfortable , reasonably priced place to stay on the famous Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Fast , friendly service from professional staff . Room ##s are of modest size but comfortable with quality bed ##ding and clean . Good deals th ##ru hotels . com are regularly offered . BT ##W , for U ##ber fans it ’ s a good idea to use ‘ Michael Jordan ’ s St ##eak ##house / address for better service given the city block size of the hotel and the g ##ps mapping v ##aga ##ries in the area . Unfortunately for us , we didn ’ t figure this out until the end of our trip . The history display in the lobby is worth a few minutes , as well as the historic Olympic sized indoor pool on the 12th floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in the city center and many attractions can be reached within walking distance . The rooms are very small but nicely decorated . The elevators take some time to get to one ' s floor as it ' s an older building . W ##if ##i is charged extra , which for a hotel of this price category is a bit surprising . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was clean but the room temperature was so uncomfortable ! No matter what we did , the the ##rm ##ost ##at never affected the temperature of the room . It got so stuff ##y at night that we couldn ' t sleep well . I was there for business and the conference rooms on the other hand were extremely cold . I was either hot or freezing the entire stay . Very uncomfortable ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a f ##abulous stay over July 4 weekend . Fantastic location and great service , especially loved the happy hour with compliment ##ary wine : ) . We would not go back over long weekend to Chicago was so busy ! Would however definitely recommend hotel Monaco . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was f ##abulous ! Love ##d the view and the location . Close to Navy Pier , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and Mill ##eni ##um Park and downtown shopping and restaurants ! This is my go - to hotel for my stays in Chicago . The staff are very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el in Chicago ' s Gold Coast was the perfect location for a girls weekend / birthday celebration . We were walking distance to many of Chicago ' s beautiful shops and restaurants , and had a room with a gorgeous view of the the city and the lake . We will definitely be back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although small , the room was peaceful and well appointed with everything I needed for a rest ##ful stay in between very busy business schedule . Well located too - I was able to walk to almost all of my events . The lack of breakfast or room service can be f ##rust ##rating but there are plenty of options nearby . The de ##cor could do with being updated but doesn ’ t de ##tract as everything works , is clean and the bed is comfortable . The provision ( on request ) of a coffee machine and Star ##bu ##cks coffee pod ##s is a really nice touch and I used it every day . Also appreciated the text service from guest relations periodically checking on what I needed - very friendly and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . Alto ##get ##her I ’ d really recommend this hotel . Thanks for a lovely stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The river view was great . The rooms were clean and open . The service at the restaurant and bar were at ##ten ##tive and persona ##ble . The food was very good . But the drinks were expensive in my opinion . Overall i was very satisfied with the people and service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I had a wonderful stay at the Fair ##mont Chicago . The hotel was gorgeous , clean , and every single person was friendly and at ##ten ##tive . We upgraded to a con ##cier ##ge suite and were able to access the gold lounge . Jesus , Pat ##ric ##io , and all the staff in the gold lounge made our stay so much better and un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Strong sewage odor in the bathroom . Got worse the 2nd day . Guest services said they had someone check it out but could not resolve the problem . They finally offered to change my room after 2nd complaint . House ##keeping should have not allowed the room to be used . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for a week long business trip . The location of the hotel is fantastic - it ' s within a few blocks of the Hancock tower and the magnificent mile is just 2 blocks away . Quality of room and service were very good . The am ##bian ##ce in the bar is very good . Staff are very professional ##A ##rea ##s for improvement : No desk in my room , so working from the room was a little tough ##T ##he internet was just okay but not great [SEP]
1	[CLS] The stay was great . The staff was very re ##sp ##ons ##ive , and offered me a new room when I commented on the loud ##ness of the air handling system in my room - - at 3 : 00 ##am ! The bed was very comfortable , and the TV was H ##U ##GE ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We took my grandson on a train trip to Chicago and stayed at the Chicago Hilton , we had a wonderful time and love the Hilton hotel . It was very reasonable and central located . The staff were very friendly and the hotel very clean , I would highly recommend staying here if you are in the Chicago area for any reason [SEP]

1	[CLS] the American Cafe was a disappointment . not up to H ##ya ##tt standards . the rooms were clean , overall experience at H ##ya ##tt was up to expectations . Of course , H ##ya ##tt is always on the expensive side . the internal " star ##bu ##cks " 24 hour market is a nice addition . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived on a Friday night to see a show . The location was perfect for the theater . The hotel is gorgeous . We had an interior courtyard room so the usual Chicago traffic noise was blocked . Breakfast b ##uff ##et had many good quality selections . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed here on a recent trip to Chicago because I was seeing the Phantom of the Opera . Luckily , the hotel was right next door to the Cadillac Palace Theatre . I had a wonderful stay here and had no problems whatsoever . However , the room was a bit small . I compare it to the Palmer House , where I stayed when I saw Hamilton in Chicago in November . The bathroom sink was awkward to use and I also found that the ice machine was on the floor below mine , which was a bit in ##con ##ven ##ient . But I didn ' t like this hotel any less . It was q ##ua ##int , quiet and in the perfect location , next to the Theatre I was attending , which was what I wanted since I was traveling as a single female . I had no problems with the w ##if ##i or any of the amenities , so I have no problem recommend ##ing this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean rooms . Quiet . Great location on the magnificent mile . Had a great room o ##er ##fect for our family . We had a suite that consisted of 2 rooms , separated by a door . King bed in one room and a pull ##out couch in the second room . There was also plenty of room for a roll away bed . Kids were able to have fun without driving mom and dad crazy . Great price too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent four nights there with my family . Could not ask for a better location . It was tough to swallow paying $ 70 a day to park but overall was a good value for the nice room and location . Staff was also extremely nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice room with excellent bed and bathroom . Good view . Con ##ci ##rer ##ge service was awesome ! ! Gale did a great job . Bar service was poor and very expensive . Need ##ed more bar tender ##s . Dr ##ink ##s were expensive . . . $ 15 for a Bloody Mary ? Really ? [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is old ##fa ##shi ##oned and elegant with a time ##less air . Staff were warm and un ##ob ##st ##rus ##ive , it was quiet and good place to relax while being in the midst of Chicago bust ##le . Love the location , and am ##bie ##nce . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Ambassador Chicago is convenient ##ly located in the Gold Coast , pretty near to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Small , yet comfortable . Room ##s are clean , neat , and have a warm atmosphere . I ’ m definitely coming back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We through ##ly enjoyed our stay here and we were sad we were only staying one night ! The location was phenomena ##l as well as the view from our room . Our kids loved the window seats so much those chose to sleep there instead of the bed . We also had a chance during wine time to chat with Eric who is part of their “ manager in training ” program and he was incredibly persona ##ble and so friendly ! He will certainly be an asset to the Kim ##pton Family ! Thank you for a great night in Chicago : ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was very helpful with all things regarding the area ; places to eat , sights to see , where to shop and anything else you can think of . The hotel was im ##ma ##culate inside and out great location to do many things in downtown Chicago . Overall an absolutely great experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location ! The room was really nice , a one bedroom suite with corner windows with an east and north view . Staff was very friendly and helpful . Within walking distance to Millennium Park and many restaurants . Will definitely stay there again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was horrified at the size of the room and how dark and do ##w ##dy it was . I know this is an historic property but at least bring it into the next century for today ' s travel ##ler . The reception staff were not very friendly and I was happy to leave this place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived around 8 ##am ( early flight ) fully expecting to have to check our luggage and access our room after 3 ##pm - - NO ##P ##E ! They were super g ##rac ##ious and let us into our room early which was so wonderful ! Our room was very spacious and comfortable . We L ##O ##VE ##D the window seat . We didn ' t din ##e at the hotel or take advantage of anything more than sleeping , but we ' d definitely return . The hotel staff is amazing , and the room was wonderful ! It ' s also in the P ##ER ##F ##EC ##T location . We walked everywhere within minutes ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had stayed several times in the previous Conrad just a few blocks away and always enjoyed it , but this is on an even higher level . Friendly , welcoming staff ready to help ; superb location ; excellent roof terrace bar and restaurant with great views . But the high spot is the rooms : large , spacious , well appointed and very quiet indeed . P ##lent ##y of cup ##board space throughout . It would be nice if something could be done to less ##en the banging of doors in the corridor , but otherwise a hotel in which you feel most comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Before the stay even commenced , I had three employees tell me three different things . One said I could check in early with no fee , another said I have to pay for a F ##U ##LL night , the last one said they cannot do an early check in at all . I don ’ t expect to be treated as if I ’ m special , but it became confusing when I arrived at 4 ##am to an employee telling me I have to pay for a full night when I received a different answer previously . The stay over all went well once we went out and did not have to interact with the employees , but from first impressions it felt like there was no communication or care about giving guest the correct information . As said previously , the hotel is just fine . The staff can be hit or miss . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was probably my favorite hotel ever . We pay ##ed a little extra to get upgraded to a king standard with a view and it was totally worth it . Love ##d the window seat and the de ##cor was ch ##ic yet comfortable . The staff were all very friendly , especially the door ##man who always helped hail a cab and went out of his way to make us feel welcome . We will definitely be coming back here next time we have a ch ##ica ##go get ##away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice and quiet ( what I needed ! ) . Great service Would stay there again . Room ##s were great Excellent restaurants I had no problems Des ##k staff very helpful Great location in downtown Chicago Walking distance to shops [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay at the Conrad . The staff was nice and the room extremely clean which is always appreciated . The only issue is parking . There ’ s literally only 3 parking spots to get your car into v ##alet so if those are full you need to double park anger ##ing the people behind you or circle the block which takes 15 ’ . My only other suggestion is to increase your late night menu . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The customer service was superb from the moment I walked in until I checked out . Every person I interact ##ed with went out of their way to meet my needs and make my stay great . The facilities were imp ##ec ##ca ##bly clean , the rooms , the pool , work ##out facilities , restaurant . . . everything ! A special recognition to De ##met ##rie and Met ##ta for going above and beyond , we was truly appreciated ! The location was great and very convenient . I look forward to returning to Chicago and the Swiss ##ote ##l soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Si ##mp ##ly wonderful ! I was there during the Polar V ##ortex , and even with reduced staff - people couldn ' t get to work - staff and service remained top - class . I was amazed at how reasonable the prices were , and stayed in the Executive floor with its excellent views and serve - yourself breakfast . I can ' t wait to visit again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve had the pleasure of staying here on multiple occasions while on business . The service is excellent . The rooms are clean and quiet and nicely appointed . The amenities are what you ' d expect at this level of hotel . The bar is fun . Breakfast at the restaurant is sufficiently French to pro ##voke a smile . The coffee drinks are me ##h . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A large hotel that ’ s ideal ##ly placed close to Michigan Avenue and other nearby places . The rooms are spread across 2 wings and some have nice views looking over Lake Michigan and Michigan Ave . This hotel is more used as a convention and business hotel including numerous Airlines for their Flight At ##tend ##ants . The big bar is a nice place to hang out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Used an award certificate to upgrade to a one bedroom suite . View of Millennium Park was awesome . Only issue with the room was proximity to elevator bank and associated noise during the day . Also , some of the furniture was dated ( arm ##chair in bedroom had cracked vinyl ) Service by the staff at the hotel was awesome and friendly . It was an un ##sea ##son ##ably hot weekend in Chicago . The staff offered us chilled water bottles as we walked in . Room service staff were friendly and at ##ten ##tive . Looking forward to the next stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our go to hotel for Chicago . Can get reasonable rates but it is the level of service and welcoming across all employees that stands out . Great location , amenities , and rooms too . Hard to beat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Three day stay in Chicago for concerts and theater . This hotel is in a perfect location . Check in was very smooth . C ##ait ##lin not only got us in quickly but also had out fed ex package which the hotel had held for two weeks . We stay in the loop on occasion . Our room was above average in size . Nice selection of t ##v channels . Water pressure in shower was more than adequate . The happy hour was well attended . We did not go , but the people who were there seemed to be having fun . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We arrived about an hour early for check in time . Adrian ##a greeted me at check in and kindly told me we could wait in the lobby until our room was ready . After about 15 minutes she told us she was able to get us an upgrade . She asked about our trip and found out about the birthday ##s we were celebrating for my daughter and husband . We continued to see her throughout our trip and she was always so pleasant . Even giving us free tissue out of the store to take with us for my daughter ’ s cold . It wasn ’ t just her though . From v ##alet to breakfast everyone was f ##abulous . The room was great , pool was perfect for the kids and the location was awesome . We were close to just about everything we wanted to do . I would definitely stay here again and was already telling people about it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have been staying at the Talbot ##t for many years whilst visiting Chicago and have to say this little hotel is brilliant . The staff are un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly friendly , from D ##wayne , Charles , Gene who always are there to help you down to every single staff member who are friendly and make your stay a wonderful experience . Breakfast was cooked and served brilliant ##ly and if you enjoy a real es ##press ##o then the Talbot ##t is for you , I would go as far as to say that Dean served the best es ##press ##o in Chicago . Room ##s are clean and comfortable , location is spot on only down ##side was that one of the lifts were out of action for upgrade , personally I don ’ t know why this wasn ’ t done last year during major upgrades and the hotel was closed . Will definitely stay here when next I ’ m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a big celebration in our family - 40th birthday ' s only come around once . Reach ##ed out to the hotel who put us in contact with Travis - that ' s where we just sat back and relaxed . He suggested restaurants , bars and even made sure to have a welcome card with a treat for us ! We had 5 rooms and L ##O ##VE ##D IT ! They made sure we were all together which was so thoughtful ! We were able to bring our pet which was beyond helpful since we knew it would be a cold weekend . Thank you Travis and everyone for making this a very special 40th birthday ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was great and the staff were friendly and helpful from beginning to end . The room was very clean and updated . The halls were quiet even though the hotel seemed busy . En ##joy ##ed a cocktail at the ma ##rt ##ini bar and people watched . Put on many miles walking the town , the location is excellent if you like to shop and explore the magnificent mile area . The breakfast b ##uff ##et was very good and convenient . We will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff were helpful and friendly . The room was clean with a well - stock ##ed kitchen for cooking meals . A wonderful place to stay for light sleep ##ers - - - no noise problems at all . . . even a room next to the elevator ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Poor front desk experience and interaction with guest services manager . Front desk did NO ##T explain there would be an excessive hold held on my credit card - - $ 1760 for four days , which exceeded the room charges by nearly $ 400 ! ! My credit card company notified me . Upon calling the front desk with concerns , no one was reach ##able at the front desk and it took the guest services manager Derek nearly 90 minutes to return the call . It took him a couple of times to clearly explain the reasons with no sincere a ##pologies offered or options provided to alleviate the excessive ##ness of the charges . Property seems fine but not impressed with the services or lack of at ##ten ##tive ##ness provided thus far . [SEP]
1	[CLS] His professional ##ism and kind efficient at ##ten ##tive ##ness to us was a wonderful . Because of D ##wayne , and others too , he cement ##ed our love for The Talbot . We so look forward to our return to your world class hotel . Mark [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome hotel in one of the best Chicago locations possible . The staff was amazing , the room was huge . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds and clean room . We perfect for what we needed . The only down ##side was the bathroom was very small . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is located in the heart of the most tourist ##ic avenue , the building itself I considered it as an architecture jewel . The pool is amazing . Has the perfect balance among past and modern lifestyle . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ki ##nz ##ie a few times over the past 6 months and always had a good time . This time , I had G ##RE ##AT experience . At check - in , Drake , went AB ##O ##VE and B ##E ##Y ##ON ##D to make sure I was in a room I was comfortable in . So much so that he double checked if I needed anything and even moved me to a different room with a nice ##r view , after a very minor comment on my part . As a surgeon , and consultant , attention to detail is key . Drake , excellent work ! Super impressed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Staff could not have been nice ##r . Room was bright , clean and comfortable . En ##tra ##nce and Vale ##t staff were happy , helpful and kind . Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago for any type of stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent hotel . Co ##m ##fort ##able room with a beautiful bathroom . The bed was incredibly comfortable and the pillows were f ##abulous . The staff is cord ##ial and helpful . I felt very p ##amp ##ered here . I would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great central ##ly located hotel with quick access by u ##ber / lift to most everything . The room could use some repair ( p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper , leak ##y f ##au ##ce ##t , heating / cooling ) . The lobby is lovely but they need a larger bar to accommodate all the guest it was in ##ac ##cess ##ible due to all the people trying to get served . Staff was friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved the hotel and the area , how clean it was , after 2 hours of being in the room we hear a disturbing noise in the bathroom and it was the toilet over ##f ##lo ##od ##ing and water all over the place . . unfortunately it got our stuff wet . Very unpleasant [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile in early March 2018 . The staff was court ##eous and upgraded our room from the 6th floor to the 32nd top floor because of our late check - in . Need ##less to say , we were very surprised and grateful ! The view was nothing short of amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt Staff went above and beyond expected service when they accommodate ##d us with a room change due to our son ' s autism and fear of the 32nd floor . Every person we dealt with was kind , consider ##ate , and cared about our situation and our son . We received excellent service throughout our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco provides an excellent location , a great hotel staff and a friendly , knowledge ##able con ##cier ##ge , Tim . Our room overlooked the river , and our daughter especially loved the window seats ! The room was spacious and clean and taste ##fully decorated . The Star ##bu ##cks coffee in the lobby is an added bonus . We especially enjoyed having a gold ##fish in the room ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The height of the Hilton experience in the heart of Chicago - This is a fantastic place to be able to access all of Chicago ’ s best sites and shopping . We were impressed - it ’ s definitely a worth ##while place to stay - comfortable , clean , with full service - great experiences - we ’ ve been coming for years - and as they seem to get better each year - we will return as soon as possible . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently made a quick trip to Chicago with the family for a college visit . We were looking for a hotel downtown Chicago near Michigan Ave . this bout ##ique hotel met all of our needs . We had never stayed at this property but will definitely stay here again in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I thoroughly enjoyed everything about my stay at the H ##ya ##tt . I would definitely stay here again . The room was spacious , clean and quiet . The view of the Chicago sky ##line was nothing short of spectacular . The food was well prepared and the staff was polite and eager to help . The breakfast b ##uff ##et was delicious . The hotel is central ##ly located very close to all of the activities we enjoyed in the city . Most of which were well within walking distance of the hotel I was very impressed ; and so was my date . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conference . Nice water view room of the river into the city . Room had some minor wear . Most staff were very friendly , a few were having bad days . Restaurant ##s and bar are typical hotel places . So many things are easily walk ##able . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##abulous hotel . Great location . Amazing breakfast included and the happy hour is awesome ! Great drinks and v ##ibes from the bartender ##s . But what made the trip excellent was Spencer ! He helped us girls every day with recommendations directions reservations and so much more . Absolutely f ##abulous ! Ask for Spencer ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay in this ups ##cale elite Chicago neighborhood and act like a local . . Historical neighborhood , and close enough to the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le of downtown Chicago . S ##nu ##ggled in between Lincoln Park Zoo and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our preferred hotel for business and pleasure . The place is a his ##t ##p ##rical g ##em and we love wandering around the first 8 floors looking at all of the old ma ##sonic architecture . Inside and out it ' s a Chicago landmark worth experiencing . It has some of the most interesting suites I ' ve ever seen . Whenever we have events that have us downtown we spend a few days here . Great people in all divisions from Will , Clive and Hussein at the door to the people at the desk and in the halls . The restaurants are great too and Jordan ##s and E ##N ##O have great people watching windows . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second visit to O ##mm ##i . Rate ##s were reasonable . Very satisfied . Staff is very pleasant and offers assistance at every turn . Room was clean and inviting . Con ##cier ##ge was very helpful with questions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we wanted a room with a river view and that was no problem at all , we had a blessed time there . after checking out I forgot an important document in room and Mr . Collin Rod ##eb ##ach ( Risk Management Officer ) went above and beyond to make sure that I get my documents before the room get cleaned up . awesome team work and highly recommend to stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 2 nights at She ##rato ##n and couldn ' t fault it . Staff very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Clean and spacious rooms . Had excellent view over the Chicago river . Would definitely recommend . Fe ##lt s ##po ##ilt from arrival to departure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Walk ##ed in and knew this was going to be a little different than other hotels we have stayed in . . . . there was no regular front desk . There were individual desk ##s that we went to . W ##E got there right before the start of the night ##ly manager ' s reception . We were given token ##s for a free drink . The room was very spacious with huge windows . Love ##d that breakfast was until 10 : 30 on the weekend ! There were really soft robes to wear to breakfast . . . which was hosted on each floor . The beds were so ##oo ##o comfortable and we got a great night ' s sleep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went during de radio ##logy congress RS ##NA 2018 . The location in Michigan Avenue is perfect , the hotel is very clean and the room was es ##pa ##cious ( which is not easy to happen . Even being a large hotel the service e ##as very good [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were upgraded to the Executive floor in a 2 Queen , 2 Bath room . The views and natural light were fantastic . Noise from Grant Park and traffic noise are a down ##side , though . It was disappointing to learn , as well , that the Executive floor no longer has an Executive Lounge . Room service was quick and friendly . The common areas were clean and well - maintained . Overall , our stay was just okay . Not bad , not really memorable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 5 nights . They recognised S ##pire status , upgraded to a nice corner suite and $ 10 bar discount . The room was clean , warm , nice bathroom and the bed very comfortable . The morning coffee and evening prose ##cco in the lobby was a very nice touch . Location good , walking distance to the amazing Art Institute , the River ##walk , big shops and the Clark / lake blue line for the $ 5 O ' Hare airport transit . The gym was a bit limited and smell ##y but better than no gym . Their 123 Italian restaurant was very good . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I know this review is pretty late but I wanted to let you guys know I had a great time at this hotel beautiful room . I love the social hour and most important Leah at the front desk , she has a con ##tag ##ious personality . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will be booking again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Even upon entry , I was greeted with a smile and directions to the lobby even without asking . When I arrived back , I was greeted with a welcome back ! Front lobby reception ##ists were very kind and went above to make sure my evening went better than my work day . All staff were pro ##active and eager to assist , even before asking for help ; like they could read the situation and knew what I needed . Room ##s were nicely equipped , clean , and with great views ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] All should enjoy the joy of being a guest at So ##fit ##el of Chicago . It is ideal ##ly located in the Loop , and the amenities offered are une ##qua ##led anywhere else in Chicago . The service at all entries is superb , the rooms are s ##pic and span , and you immediately feel you are part of the family . Do try it ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] No water glasses in the room , coffee and accompaniment ##s not properly re ##ple ##nish ##ed every day , looks as if staff don ' t care as they are going to get the convention business anyway . Not enough staff to cover the morning rush . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came back this year because of Alex the con ##cier ##ge ! He took such good care of me last year , making sure I enjoyed the city in the evenings after my meetings . Send ##ing me to the best restaurants with the best service . I felt welcome everywhere I went because they were expecting me and my colleague . I had the same experience this year . All of the staff here are extremely friendly and helpful . I was traveling for business , attending a conference and the staff made all the difference in enjoying my trip . Last year I stayed at the W at the Lake and moved here after interacting with Alex and he remembered me ! ! I ’ ll be back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ent lobby , nice location . Got to my room and found ear ##p ##lug ##s on the table . Odd . . . until I sat in the room for a bit and heard a loud w ##hin ##ing sound that lasted for about 15 seconds . Seems like it happens every time someone uses the elevator . I called the front desk and they said they were sold out and couldn ' t move me . Its Wednesday . . . really ? She mentioned there were ear ##p ##lug ##s at in the room . Not staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the Conrad Chicago over a long weekend . We arrived late at night and found that two pillows were unchanged and their was a pill laying on the ground and the stay didn ' t want to clean it . The following two nights the pill was still on the ground even after talking to management twice . We are Hilton gold members and were treated like we were invisible . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They are so polite and helpful that this is one of the best places in Chicago to stay . We travel with a pet and they do not charge you extra for that here . Which is rare these days . We come to Chicago 5 to 6 times a tear and love this location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing hotel , everything was great . It has the best location in Chicago and the service was more than what expected . In general its a great hotel , great rooms , very clean and the be ##s of all , just a few blocks from Michigan A ##v . [SEP]
0	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed my trip to Chicago and my stay at the H ##ya ##tt Regency . My room was in a very quiet location . Didn ’ t like the layout of our meeting and some meeting rooms were hard to locate but coffee and re ##f ##resh ##ments were plenty . Me ##al served in our banquet was superb . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay at the Palmer House often when we travel to Chicago . Love the architecture & de ##cor . This time something seemed off , nothing specific just less attention to detail & customer service . We decided to try a different hotel for our next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We said we were there for my husbands birthday and they had chocolate covered straw ##berries in the room as a surprise . We ran into the cleaning lady for floor 2 ( black lady with bra ##ids ) and she was so ##oo ##oo ##oo ##o nice and funny ! At departure while waiting for our car D ##wayne chat ##ted with us and was one of the kind ##est men I have ever met . He even opened my car door for me after the v ##alet had it pulled up for us . The room was very nice and clean ! The location was perfect ! ! ! ! We did not need a cab or car . We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with a friend and really enjoyed the location . Just steps away from Michigan Avenue , great restaurants and the parks , I very much enjoyed walking to the Millennium Park to see their daily summer concerts . Room ##s are beautifully decorated , spacious and very comfortable . Breakfast is delicious and great quality ! High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is definitely in a . Ice central location , but it ’ s an old hotel . The rooms are standard and dated . I could only find a USB charge ##r on my alarm clock , but at the desk location there was only 1 wall plug which didn ’ t work . Bath ##room is kind of small and the maid service never gave me any new soap or s ##ham ##po ##o which became annoying after day 3 . I was on a work trip and my company selected the hotel , so I didn ’ t have much choice . If I did , I ’ d choose a newer hotel . Be aware though , this hotel has a separate building that has rooms in it . So you could get a room in a completely di ##ff building that ’ s a country mile from the lobby and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All ##egro has one of the best , live ##liest lobby ##s I ' ve ever experienced . The hotel has a happy hour and compliment ##ary coffee , tea and newspapers in the morning so its always hop ##ping . Room ##s are average size but very well - appointed . The location is close to the shopping on Michigan Avenue and a short walk to all the major theaters . The excellent restaurant , 312 is in the building . After many tries , we have found our Chicago hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this as an option when staying in the city for a weekend away from the b ##ur ##bs . Great rooms and atmosphere . Food quality was excellent but had a couple of service issues both on the rooftop for supper and drinks as well as Sunday br ##unch . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Amazing customer service ! Karen Mo ##y helped to make my proposal go off perfectly . Throughout the process she was on hand to help . The Conrad Hilton room was un ##believable and the room clean and decorated . Would definitely recommend Karen and her staff for anyone looking to put on an event or custom ##ize a stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about this hotel was great except the view from our room . The view was a parking lot and the office across the alley . I could see the details in the tissue box in the office . Room 241 or anything on the 2nd floor is a room to avoid . You could not keep the shades open because you were that close ! The room was nice , the bathroom room ##y , and the free breakfast in the morning very nice . Location was good , and the staff were helpful . I would stay here again , as long as I could get a room with more privacy and a better view . [SEP]
0	[CLS] T ##H ##IS IS THE W ##OR ##ST P ##LA ##CE I H ##AV ##E E ##VE ##R ST ##A ##Y ##ED ! The customer service were very rude and not helpful at all . I was there for a business conference where there should ’ ve known to staff more but did not apparently . It took over an hour for 3 towels . It was ridiculous . Don ##t stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] D ##wayne at the entrance of the hotel is outstanding ! His welcome smile , special help with baggage , u ##ber rides , doors etc . was so appreciated . He took a special interest with drivers and on on way to airport he told the driver " Take good care of her and take the shortest way to airport . " There had been a major accident on Highway 55 . My friends and I thought he was fantastic . . . he is a valuable employee ! In addition , the hotel manager was at ##ten ##tive and helpful as we had some key issues . TV often did not work - think it was a cable situation Des ##k staff was friendly , helpful , and also very welcoming ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everyone greeted us with a smile and was very helpful . Wonderful view of the city . Our room was available early and they brought up our luggage before we returned . Excellent service without having to ask for it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I stay here every time we go to the city for a weekend away . They always have a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff and room service and anything you need to make your stay f ##abulous ! The wardrobe is always stock ##ed with slip ##pers and a robe , the bathroom is always fully stock ##ed with lot ##ions and soap ##s , ( and incredibly clean ) and there ’ s a Star ##bu ##cks right downstairs ! P ##ER ##F ##EC ##T for Michigan Ave shopping ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is super convenient and it ’ s easy to go to every attraction . The room is big enough and clean . But the staff should add extra shower cap especially after it has been used . Food in the restaurant is quite good [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile was f ##abulous ! My mom , sister and I stayed there just overnight on a mini - get ##away girl ’ s weekend and it was the perfect location , right on Michigan Avenue . It ’ s close to so many stores and great restaurants and the staff there were so friendly and helpful ! We couldn ’ t have asked for a better experience ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was pleasant ##ly surprised by the clean ##liness of the hotel , location in downtown Chicago and the friendly staff . The convenience ##s of shopping for essential ##s , food and entertainment was outstanding both within and outside the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff was great and the lobby was beautifully decorated . We had drinks at the pump room bar and experienced great service , followed by breakfast the next morning but breakfast doesn ' t open until 10 . The library bar was good to hold us over though , rooms need darker shades though as the sun started coming in way too early . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! Easy walk ##ability to multi restaurants , shopping and parks . We used the Hop on Hop off bus which stops steps away from the hotel . The hotel is a little price ##y but it was well worth the convenience of location . The rooms were clean and well kept . The Vale ##t staff were absolutely outstanding with customer service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came to Chicago for a wedding and the history and price were the two things which caused me to select the hotel . When we arrived , we were given the option of a discount ##ed upgrade to the Executive Tower and were told our two rooms would have 40 % more room and great views of Michigan Avenue on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Wow ! Our view of the Chicago River and the Du ##sable Bridge were amazing ! The service was great , and we really enjoyed the breakfast b ##uff ##et . However , one unexpected highlight of our stay was just exploring the hotel . From the 1920 ' s swimming pool to the ornate banquet halls and lo ##bb ##ies , we simply loved this place . In addition , it is convenient ##ly located close to the River Walk and the first stop on the Hop - On Hop - Off Big Bus tours . [SEP]
1	[CLS] High ##ly recommend to anyone visiting the Chicago area ! Easy access to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile - easy and ample parking all around if needed , nice lounge on 32nd ( ? ) floor gives breath ##taking view of the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was at the Fair ##mont for a week long intensive review of material for my medical sub - specialty . I stayed on the Con ##cier ##ge floor and was so very impressed with the service and the world class hospitality . Cody , T ##ip ##hani , Jesus , and Man ##dan ##a were particularly cord ##ial and helpful . I look forward to my return for next years conference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel over the Christmas holiday . It was a wonderful experience . Great location - we had access to a lot of great shopping and activities . The hotel staff ( especially the v ##alet team ) were exceptional - very friendly and always willing to help . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was really nice . Wish you offered 2 bedroom suites . We traveled with our adult sons and the pull out bed was not conform ##able for them . Would have loved a hot tub after a day of walking . Breakfast was top notch , the food was very good and selection was good as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Some girlfriend ##s from out of town and I booked this hotel through a Hot ##wire Hot ##rate deal so that we could stay in the city for the weekend . We didn ' t choose this hotel specifically , it was part of the mystery deal . It ' s advertised as a 4 - star hotel , and I ' m not really sure how . The lobby and the rooms are very under ##w ##hel ##ming , especially for the price we paid with a " deal " . During the summer this would be a great location to walk to Oak Street Beach or North Avenue Beach as the lake is less than two blocks away . After this , I will be hesitant to use a Hot ##wire deal again if this is what is considered a luxury 4 - star . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The good : beautiful hotel , great room , great location . Co ##m ##fy beds . The front desk staff is as ##to ##und ##ingly good and we want to thank Lane ##tte for her help . Not so good : house ##keeping . We had to call every day for towels ( wash ##cloth ##s ) and coffee pod ##s . We also came back to the room one day after house ##keeping served our room to find the door open and our stuff un ##se ##cure ##d . The elevator system was unusual and there was no staff to explain it . Overall , I ’ d stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our overall stay was good . Check - in and check - out process are very quick . W ##if ##i connection is excellent . Located in the center of downtown and easy access to all main attractions in ch ##ica ##go . However they need to improve the clean ##liness of room . Room carpet looks old and we could see dirty stain ##s at the corners . Also , I ##MO the wooden furniture ##s and wall decorations are not up to current trend . It requires some upgrade . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first trip to Chicago , and even though it looked close to everything on the map , I had no idea what a perfect location this would be ! Everything - The Loop , great restaurants , Michigan Ave . , Mill ##eni ##um Park , and more is basically a stone ' s throw away ! Almost everything of interest was a short walk away or just a 1 - 2 min walk to the CT ##A bus stop . The room was comfortable and extremely clean ! ! Breakfast was good , even without hot foods . We even got free drink token ##s for their Happy Hour each night in the lounge . I absolutely would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a " Historic Hotel Winner " . . . Not even close . So sad Hilton ! Hotel areas were dirty and we watched hotel staff walk right by garbage on the ground . Room ##s are must ##y and not very clean at all . We found old towels in the closet from the prior customer . The hotel wanted to charge $ 40 for the f ##rig to remove the mini ##bar products . I am a Hilton Diamond member and stay 150 plus days a year in Hilton hotels . This is by far the worst of them all . D ##O NO ##T WA ##ST ##E YOU ##R T ##IM ##E OR M ##ON ##E ##Y ON T ##H ##IS H ##OT ##EL . Stay at the Hampton inn on Monroe west of here . Better service and very clean hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean ! quite and helpful . I was travelling ( driving ) from Toronto and got in late . They were the only hotel that took us in . Beautiful ##ly decorated On the water and it was very inviting having an early coffee watching the tour boats going by . Food was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wife and I enjoyed our first trip to Chicago at this hotel . F ##Y ##I , let your U ##ber / L ##y ##ft know that you are on the upper level , not lower level or else your driver will be circling around the lower part of the street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the Palmer house for several years , mostly during December . The location is ideal if you are interested in checking out the State street lights , and Millennium Park . Some of the rooms can be small , but it is easily not ##ated when booking with Hilton . Be sure to check out the lobby , which is very unique . If you are checking in on a weekend during the Christmas season , be sure to consider becoming a Hilton honors member , which allows you to check in digitally . The lines can be quite long . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel and for me convenient for conference stay . Near Navy Pier , did find I needed a l ##y ##ft for most places I wanted to go . Room ##s were clean . Bed and linen was very comfortable . Second stay and the room I had this stay was more than one person needed but was an incredible location . Corner room on the 30th floor with minimal views of the lake and great views of the river . Hotel staff was very helpful ! On a side note , I would not necessarily recommend the Palm restaurant , did not have the same experience there with customer service or my meal . Am ##use offered breakfast choices but found them to be cold . Lu ##nch and dinner much better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We traveled the Chicago with our 3 children and stayed at this hotel . We had a bedroom , den with pull out sofa and a roll ##away . Large bathroom and windows overlooking N Michigan Ave . Great location for walking to lots of good restaurants , the Navy Pier , M Daly Park . Dylan ##s Candy Bar is across the street so the kids loved this . Nice hotel bar and we were able to get snack ##s , kids menu , , etc . Also had indoor pool which kids enjoyed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Such a beautiful hotel inside and out . Fine ##ly decorated yet welcoming . Staff was great , bed was Amazing ##ly comfortable ! Location perfect with nearby public parking less expensive than hotel parking . Price un ##believable for Chicago . Will definitely stay here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Un ##ique Hotel . Wish ##ing they would have preserved the history of this hotel . Most of the original d ##é ##cor has been removed . No longer of historical relevance . Stay ##ed there mainly due to its past reputation which it did not live up to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For having the name Hilton , this hotel just didn ' t live up to the name or cost associated with the name . Room was just okay - clean , basic . No coffee pot so had to pay for Star ##bu ##cks from the lobby every morning if I wanted coffee . Bed ##s were comfortable , but our room faced a main street so it was very noisy all night , particularly since I was there over a weekend . Lots of sire ##ns all the time . Staff was friendly - staff lived up to the Hilton name . The location of this hotel is a little odd too . It ' s kind of in a pocket meaning you have to pass through some not as nice looking areas to get to the tourist ##y stuff , like shopping or the loop . Also , the pool is not very family - friendly . It ' s really more of a lap pool which was disappointing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic experience . Great views of the city and located in a great spot . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and knowledge ##able of the city ' s restaurants , shopping and places to go to enjoy Chicago . My wife and I will definitely stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service could not have been better - the location is perfect as well . The hotel was clean too . My problems stem ##med with room maintenance . Only one remote worked . Make Up mirror short ##ed in & out . Very dark room , even though it had two big windows the d ##rea ##ry days meant no light . I had to crawl under the desk to plug my lamp in , then the light bulb didn ' t work . I got so tired of the poor lighting I finally moved my nightstand bulb to the desk . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has imp ##ec ##ca ##ble customer service and the absolute best accommodation ##s . The bar and restaurant are great , but the staff is what makes this hotel experience so outstanding ! Their attention to detail is above and beyond what you expect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful location and great views ! We enjoyed our corner room with windows that open to let in the fresh air . The con ##cier ##ge made good recommendations and we loved Kitty O ' Shea ' s Fi ##g B ##read and G ##uin ##ess . Hu ##ge hotel with bout ##ique service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome location with great service and clean room . I thought we were getting a j ##r suite and we ended up with a spacious hand ##ica ##p room . It was a nice room but I would have liked to have the option to switch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed the location close to everything to include subway line . Many restaurants nearby . Walking distance to a lot of sights ##ee ##ing locations . Small room but comfortable . No coffee pot in room but Star ##bu ##cks downstairs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is one of the best Hilton hotel brands that I have ever stayed . I only stayed for one night , used digital key and never engaged a person for check in or check out except for v ##alet parking . The location is excellent and I will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is clean and well maintained . Total ##ly updated inside . Con ##cier ##ge staff is very helpful . Nice compliment ##ary breakfast ass ##ort ##ment on each floor in the mornings and compliment ##ary happy hour with nice ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres in the early evening . Very well located - - can walk to so much of the City from their . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room wasn ’ t well lit , paint p ##eel ##ing in bathroom , someone ’ s old so ##ck was behind our dresser . Food was ok but small portions for the high price ! The area was great lots of things to do , but next time will try a different hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It wasn ##t bad . . but you get what you pay for . . . I paid cheap and it was not so clean the way I expected it to be . . it was with finger ##print the cups looked very old . . . but the staff where pretty nice I tried their best to please [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##abulous location , we brought our bikes , rode or walked everywhere , room was co ##zy , comfortable , modern and trend ##y . Price was more than competitive , staff more than friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , hotel itself has neat historic feel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our trip to Chicago and the beautiful So ##fit ##el Hotel . This was both a couples and business trip . The guest rooms are very nice , if small , and the service from the staff was excellent . Our meeting space and food service was also first rate . The hotel is well located for access to Michigan Avenue with many choices nearby . I would return without hesitation . Thank you for an enjoyable trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is well situated . However , it doesn ' t offer room service ( there was no menu in the room ) . The style is re ##tro art de ##co and the hotel is clearly of a historic nature but they ' ve carried the black and gold theme too far with black and grey walls and black painted furniture . The effect is dark and din ##gy . My room was very small and the bathroom tiny . Car ##pet dirty in rooms , hallway ##s and elevators . Overall it needs a strong face ##lift with a new coat of bright paint and a friend ##lier ( not got ##h ) de ##cor . On the good side , the free morning coffee service was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a couple days during kids spring break . Room was clean and nice . Great to have kitchen available . Co ##mple ##mentary breakfast was overall nice . Staff was always welcoming when you return from walking the street . I have stayed in Chicago several times and enjoy this location the most . Really close to a lot of places . I look forward to returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic stay at the Ambassador - - Jared was particularly helpful . Great location within walking distance of many amenities including Lake Michigan . Would definitely go back and stay again . Re ##com ##men ##d this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Thank you for a great experience , from our stay to our dining . Everything was just right . The Talbot ##t Hotel was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . A time of retreat and renewal . Our 5 nights were rest ##ful and renew ##ing . We will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I made a last - minute reservation on Trip ##A ##d ##visor through Get A Room . Upon arriving at the hotel , they hadn ' t received my confirmation yet . The reception was friendly and quickly resolved . We were in room 141 ##1 , which was clean and comfortable . Lots of elevators , we never had to wait long . There are no coffee makers in the room so we ordered coffee in the morning . One large f ##rench press , which was very good , was basically $ 20 with milk and a tip . There is also no ve ##nding machines or a lobby store to buy beverages . Next time I will bring a few of my own . I will stay again , especially for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is great and the staff friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We had a minor problem and the manager called to let us know after we were home that the problem was being addressed . I ’ ve never experienced such great service from a hotel before . Will definitely go back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve recently stayed at this hotel in Chicago and was very impressed with the service and de ##cor of the rooms . Very elegant and modern all around . I look forward to staying at this hotel on my upcoming business trip . I wish other hotels could take a page from this hotel . Keep up the great work ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed in multiple Chicago hotels , but always come back to Monaco . The location suits us very well , being on W ##ack ##er & W ##aba ##sh . It ' s an easy walk to most places , and taxi ' s are easy to get . The rates are often competitive . The thing we love best is the uniquely decorated rooms with the big window bench seats . The views are pretty from the bench seats . The beds are comfortable , and the rooms are spacious , even for the standard room . Occasionally you can hear the El , but it has never disturbed our sleep . The staff is always friendly and a ##cco ##mo ##dating . We recommend it to everyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was very well appointed and the rooms were well maintained . Very clean quiet location . I was on the 22nd floor and had great views . Would stay again and recommend this property to anyone visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great experience . The room was updated , clean , and great air conditioning . Only down ##side is no pool in hotel . We arrived at 11 ##am and got early check in . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary late check out until 1 ##pm . Room service was great ( needed more towels , couldn ' t work the t ##v remote ) staff is very pleasant and made the stay enjoyable as well . A ##ble to walk everywhere we needed to go to downtown . Beach , second city , Hamilton , rest ##ura ##unts . Would do again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] With Nord ##strom , eat ##aly , and pizza ##ria un ##o all within a stones throw it is hard to beat this hotels location . Comes with an good breakfast ( better than Hampton inn ) and a fridge in the room . The room are a decent size for downtown and the sofa bed is acceptable . Of course the $ 56 v ##alet parking is hard to s ##wo ##llow but that is s tank ##ard Chicago rates . You could self park on Ohio and save a few dollars as long as you are not moving the car [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed twice at the Talbot ##t and will be back a third time in October . The whole place just has a wonderful feel to it . The staff is top notch and the rooms are elegant . One wishes for a better option for parking but it is in heart of downtown so what do you expect ? We got two free drink v ##ou ##chers for the bar which was a nice touch . The location is great for walking all around the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel and exceptional staff . The con ##cier ##ge , David Moore , was very polite and helped answer any questions that I had . Will definitely be staying here again ! Well stock ##ed bar in the lobby and compliment ##ary coffee bar in the mornings ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Probably my 10th or 11th visit to Palmer House over the past 20 + years . Can ' t beat the location . Staff are very at ##ten ##tive , all of them . The last 2 visits , I have been in ##vo ##lu ##nta ##rily " upgraded " to rooms which don ' t fit my needs - e . g . a King Bed vs . the 2 twins I reserved . The last visit , I reserved a specific room ( 101 ##18 ) via the online app on my trip up . . . . . only to be relocated to a room on the 15th floor overlooking the fire escape . Not cool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my family ' s second stay at The Talbot ##t , and it will be our hotel of choice for future trips to Chicago . Just a few blocks from Michigan Ave , but in a relatively quiet location with residences , dining and other convenience ##s nearby . Easy to walk to many nice restaurants and the lake , very friendly staff , nice bar downstairs , and clean , large rooms . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Is everything . This hotel is the e ##pit ##ome of “ everything right at your fingertips ” . Too ##k a girls trip to see Hamilton and literally just hung out in the hotel for majority of the trip . A ##wes ##ome happy hour at the wine bar ! Michael Jordan ##a was delicious with our dei ##nk v ##ou ##chers given at check in . Spa was absolutely amazing ! Not luxury but excellent mass ##eus ##es . Close to all shopping and attractions ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly will return ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great . Walking distance to Navy Pier and other attractions . Room ##s were large enough and all rooms are suits . Especially if you are staying long , it is good to have extra space . Only criticism I would have is reception staff did not give us the usual information you get when you check in in a hotel . Not much was said really . If you are staying with children and would like them to have their own bed , you may need to ask for roll - away bed , which is extra charge . I would definitely recommend their b ##uff ##et breakfast . There is so much selection , everything is so fresh and nicely cooked . Also the pool in the hotel is very nice . The whole family enjoyed it . I would definitely recommend this hotel . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister reserved rooms for the out of town guests here for her wedding . We also got ready in a suite . The staff was so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Everyone was so friendly ! Will definitely be back to stay here . Perfect location , too ! Walking distance to many places , and convenient restaurants right outside the door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ing at Ki ##nz ##ie hotel was one of the best choices that I made for the Chicago trip . Except ##ional staff ##s , rooms , amenities , and just everything ! I really loved the breakfast that they offer . Seriously it made my stay so worth it . Room was spacious and nice . I enjoyed the city view too ( 6th floor ) . I did not use the gym but there is a filtered water di ##spense ##r . The location is perfect too . the river is a block away . The Cloud ( bean ) is 10 min walk away . Also you can leave the bag on the day of departure . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Read many negative reviews of the Intercontinental , but found the hotel to be excellent . We had a corner room on the 33rd floor with view to the lake out of one window & the city out of the other . We had a grand stand view of the fireworks at the Navy Yard . In all it doesn ’ t get better than that . The room was of a good size , spot ##lessly clean & everything worked as expected . House ##keeping certainly looked after us . All the staff were at ##ten ##tive & always greeted us with a smile . It is an old hotel and has a great feel about the place . Location is fantastic with everything on our doors ##tep , shops , cafe ##s & restaurants . Easy walk to the Navy Yard and the parks along the lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful room ! We upgraded to a corner unit overlooking the river . It was worth it ! We enjoyed the window seats . The front desk staff is wonderful . We have no complaints . Check out the bread pu ##dding at the restaurant connected to the hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel . It continues to be our favorite hotel in Chicago . From the check - in to the final good - bye it is just easy and pleasant . The location is great , easy to walk to lots of attractions . The cocktail reception with snack ##s is awesome . The breakfast on each floor is perfect . So an affordable hotel close to attractions , with free cocktail ##s 5 - 8 pm , and breakfast everyday ! Room ##s are nicely appointed , beds could be a little more comfortable . We enjoyed the corner king room with a city view . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every single person encountered at the Kim ##pton greeted us with genuine warmth and helpful ##ness . Out of their way . This was the most unique feature at this hotel compared to so many other brands . The de ##cor of the Monaco was really beautiful and exotic . Our room was perfect , the bathroom was oversized and that was appreciated ! Thank you and I can ' t wait to come back to your hotel ! Also , my conference was at a huge hotel and I ' m so glad I didn ' t stay there . It was a short walk but each afternoon I felt like I was coming " home " [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay . The staff was very friendly and always tried to accommodate a request . There is a wine happy hour which is very nice where you can meet other guests and gather . The hotel is in a great central location to many places and the metro is close and easy to learn . The Mediterranean suite had a living room and a bedroom with wonderful window cu ##bb ##ies that looked out at the river . Very inviting . . Bed ##ding was soft and comfortable . A recommendation I have is if you book a regular room , they can come back and offer a stand ##by upgrade which we did and is a great offer . Just review your bill at check ##out to make sure it is the correct offer , [SEP]
1	[CLS] When in Chicago , you can ' t go wrong with She ##rato ##n Grand . This is a huge property that has all the amenities you desire . The location is excellent and the service is always good . The views are always amazing . The food options are great . The club room is better than in most She ##rato ##n and the s ##p ##g recognition is pretty good . Plus , this is an affordable hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was awesome . It ’ s located in River north close to various bars , clubs , lounge and restaurants . The hotel has great staff . The room was luxurious with all the amenities . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome experience from check in to check out . Staff was very knowledge ##able and friendly . Charlie waited on us at the bar when we checked and breakfast when we checked out . His attention to detail was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . Thank you O ##m ##ni Chicago , I will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the staff , by far the best experience I ' ve had in Chicago thus far ! The staff were very friendly , they took care of us and showed us love , the bell boys were professional , friendly and extremely helpful . I will define ##lt ##y be back soon . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff are always court ##eous and professional . Room ##s are comfortable and clean and most have a great view . While room service can be price ##y , the food is amazing . P ##lent ##y of amenities as far as bars , restaurants and shops . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in our hotel room for five minutes when there was a knock on the door . The person wanted to check the mini bar . We had already set up our suitcase which was blocking the fridge . I ' m not sure why they didn ' t do this before we got our key . It was in ##tr ##usive and decided to ask him to leave . It was weird . Des ##k staff wasn ' t so friendly and one clerk was sweating pro ##fuse ##ly ( more a / c for this guy please ) ! Room was small but nice . Bath ##room really lovely . One elevator was down so it was faster to take the stairs . It ' s at the northern end of Michigan avenue shops . Stop in to The Drake hotel across the street to see the op ##ule ##nce . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Run down rooms and poor service to match . Room ##s are loud , and poorly decorated with ta ##ttered furniture . Low water pressure , and even in our JR Suite bathroom ##s were very small . Clean ##ing crew woke us up yelling o ##bs ##ce ##ni ##ties to each other . No turn down service , and very small and un ##manned re ##gen ##cy club . We rented a conference room and the service was perfect , but everything else was ho ##rri ##d and shame on H ##ya ##tt to mi ##s ##re ##p ##res ##ent this property , although the location is great and the view of lake is always nice . Stay at the Park H ##ya ##tt , or R ##itz [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cars ##arra at the front desk was a ma ##rve ##lous help . We had arrived quite early , so she offered us an upgraded suite to get in the hotel earlier ! She told us about all the great amenities offered with our package and we were very impressed ! Very friendly and polite ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 3 nights at the Hilton Chicago on S . Michigan for a mother / daughter trip . Hotel location is ideal across from a park . The marble entrance is so beautiful . By far the best part was the staff especially Cars ##arra H . at the front desk . She found us a room earlier than regular check - in and was so kind to find us an upgrade as well as get us a room closer to the elevator since my mom uses a cane . Thank you for taking such good care of us , we will definitely be back ! [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 4 nights the beginning of July and thoroughly enjoyed this hotel . The rooms were a good size and the breakfast on each floor was a nice touch . The location was convenient to most places in downtown . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel needs a re ##fu ##rb but still a grand old girl . Some particularly noteworthy staff exhibiting outstanding customer service : Sen ##ora Dom ##iti ##la in house ##keeping . Jean ##ine , Tri ##na and Las ##haw ##n at front desk . Thank you all ! Pam [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friend ##ley door staff and front desk . Also great location . The room was really nice and spacious . My only issue was that i booked the hotel after doing a lot of research on kid friendly hotels . No kids backpack at check in . No little kids stations ni ##ck / di ##s ##ney JR you can buy a package but its around $ 15 and only good until ##l 12 ##pm the next day . Not a full 24 ##hr ##s . So two or 3 days your spending 45 - 50 . Also bathroom sink is too high for kids to brush teeth and wash face . A step stool would have been great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I showed up at 3 AM with a group of exhausted Amtrak travelers , after a 12 hour weather delay on the California Z ##ep ##hy ##r . There was only one check - in clerk available , so it took some time to process us . However , after that everything was all a tired guest could hope for . My corner room was large , attractive , and comfortable . Bath was lovely , with a tub and separate shower stall . In the morning , I had spectacular views from the 27th floor to enjoy before returning to Union Station and continuing my re ##sche ##du ##led trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] M ##K ##H Chicago is in a great location , one minute from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and with - in a ten minute walk to a variety of f ##abulous restaurants and bars . At check - in ask for K ##wa ##me , he is very professional and willing to assure your stay is top shelf . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is very central ##ly located ! We were able to walk everywhere and fine din ##ning all around . The room was amazing and the staff very helpful and pleasant . We enjoyed the hotel as much as the attractions . Can ' t wait to come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was close to everything in Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . Very clean and up to date . Would give full 5 stars but before arriving called hotel to ask about v ##alet and all 3 times got disconnected during transfer said forget it and used parking garage next door [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , quiet rooms and great central location to walk to many of the Chicago landmarks . I have stayed at this hotel several times through the past 16 or so years and the quality has been consistent and the rates are good for this area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were very clean ! Like the overall atmosphere of the hotel . Room ##s are pretty modern . Great location for a reasonable price . Thank you to Teresa Q ##uit ##o and the rest of the house ##keeping team for a great job ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] These people know how to treat guests ! We felt like royalty the whole time we were there . Every staff member is friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Justin , at the front desk knew it was our anniversary and sent up a compliment ##ary bottle of wine along with a cheese and meat tray ! He even upgraded us to a corner suite overlooking Michigan Ave . Our suite was beautifully maintained and very clean . The v ##alet ##s were so pleasant each time we left and came back , always asking if we needed anything . There ’ s just no place like the O ##m ##ni Chicago ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk staff friendly and helpful . End ##ed up up ##grading our room for an additional charge , still not impressed with our room . Seems dated and very cheap ##ly furnished , despite the reported recent renovations . Fe ##lt ha ##rassed by someone trying to sell vacation packages in the lobby after check in , not what I expected from a 4 star hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have been staying at the Ambassador , always for family visits , for almost 10 years . We love the location in that is close enough to walk into the city , but we really enjoy the neighborhood ' feel ' around the building . There are plenty of restaurants , tavern ##s , and shopping within walking distance . The coffee bar and restaurant are first - class . One main reason that we keep returning is that the staff is always friendly and helpful ; they have gone out of their way many times to welcome us back . We always feel that we have ' come home ' at the Ambassador . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay here but I feel it ' s not a 4 Diamond hotel . It is more of a 3 Diamond hotel similar to a Hilton Garden Inn or a Court ##yard by Mar ##riot ##t . My room was very clean , simple and had dual van ##ity sinks . Breakfast in the restaurant is very good but the service was lacking . This is a pet friendly hotel and Washington Square Park is only a 2 min walk . The dogs will love this park . I would stay here again . It is a cute bout ##ique hotel in a excellent location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , newly re ##mo ##del ##ed . Good value for your money . Excellent location just two blocks from Michigan Ave and it ' s surrounded by great restaurants . It ' s within walking distance to great shopping and dining . The staff is very friendly and they provided a great customer experience for us . We will definitely stay here again when we return to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed for two nights for a wedding . The hotel accommodation ##s were clean and fairly priced . The food was spend ##y but p ##lent ##iful . There are cheaper options in the cafe as well . Lau ##nd ##ry services were efficient . The staff accommodate ##d our requests in a professional manner . I will stay here anytime . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the amazing architecture to the friendly staff , this is how a hotel should be . Room ##s are very clean and spacious and the hotel offers many amenities as well as foods options . A stones throw to the theater district and the Art Institute . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago is located in the heart of downtown Chicago . The facility is maintained to the highest standards . The staff was super professional , helpful and very friendly . The room ( city view upgrade ) was worth every penny . All features and accessories functioned as they should . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was great and the staff as well . D ##wayne and Charles at the front door made the stay even better . Both gentlemen remembered details about our plans and remembered to ask us how it went when we returned to the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago every other year for a conference and continue to be impressed . The food and service is excellent and the rate offered is a great value . Vale ##t Park ##ing staff is particularly nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a gorgeous hotel , and it was well decorated for Christmas . If you like a historical type feel , then this is a must stay . It ’ s a great location as well , close to the park and Michigan Ave . Food quality was average , but could be because it was the holiday and the hotel was swamp ##ed with families , causing a lot of slow ##ness that may not be present at other times of the year . I would stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are really nice , front desk is very friendly . I hated the beds though , hard as a rock . Pretty good location . Love ##d the free wine and cocktail hour . Not many hotels offer late . They even gave me a free 2 ##pm check out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve been to this hotel recently and I felt good . I would change the bathroom ##s because a little ' out of fashion I missed a real shower . very friendly staff and excellent room service . beautiful swimming pool [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Conrad during our family vacation to Chicago in late June 2018 . We love this hotel . Pol ##ite staff , clean and s ##ty ##lish room , fast w ##i - fi , soft touch control panels to raise and lower shades and several room lighting configurations . Location was great - just off Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and just around the corner from Trade ##r Joe ’ s , Land ##ry ’ s Prime R ##ib , Eat ##ily , Shake S ##hack and just a 10 - 20 minute walk to places like to Port ##illo ’ s , G ##ior ##dan ##o ’ s , Pizza Un ##o & Due , Rose ##bu ##d on Rush , Gibson ’ s St ##eak ##house and about a 15 - 20 minute walk to River ##walk , Navy Pier , etc . We definitely recommend it and would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House has seen much better days and needs a serious make ##over . In addition , the service was poor . When we drove up , there was no one to help with our suitcase ##s and no luggage cart ##s available , while we were un ##loading our car on the very con ##ges ##ted street . The room was tiny with hardly any space to walk around the bed . The bathroom was very small as well , and the light switches and toilet were q ##ui ##rky . At the time of check ##out , the check ##out via video did not work so I had to wait on a long line at the front desk . The b ##uff ##et breakfast , at a cost of $ 30 a person , was quite ordinary and over ##p ##rice ##d . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel exceeded my expectations . I was on the 8th floor , which looked re ##mo ##del ##ed . The hallway was so unusual and pretty . My room was large and beautifully decorated with blue and yellow . The bathroom was large and had a lovely marble sink , tub with overhead hand held shower ##s , and s ##ty ##lish ch ##rome grab bars . The free coffee in the lobby was a nice touch . Fitness room was a good size . I liked the alternative 80s and 90s music in the elevator and lobby ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the Swiss ##ote ##l on W ##ack ##er Drive in Chicago are highly trained hospitality professionals . Our room was awesome , the beds are comfortable , very clean environment . Bath ##tub and separate shower . 55 inch TV . 2 - 3 blocks from Michigan Ave and the River ##walk . 10 min walking distance from State St . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is so trend ##y . The rooms are spacious and well decorated . The bathroom is well equipped . Everything is within a walking distance . The compliment ##ary tea and coffee in the morning and wine tasting on the evening are a plus . The employees were very kind . They are pet friendly - any size ! But the rooms are not smell ##y ! We had the best time at this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a business trip in October . The hotel was beautiful , the check in very smooth and quick despite the large numbers of people present due to our meeting . The room was very clean and spacious with a wonderful view of the river . The bed was comfortable . The hotel itself is very well located for exploring Chicago and close to all the shopping areas . Overall , I enjoyed my stay and would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l is a beautiful property . My spacious room was on the 21st floor in a corner , commanding a sweeping view of Chicago . Staff were friendly and helpful . The fitness room was closed for renovation but the hotel provided a v ##ou ##cher to a nearby health club . On the way out , I filled a bottle with chilled , in ##fused water . A lovely place to re ##cha ##rge before my work . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I really enjoyed my stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel , definitely better than I expected ! The room setup was great and even had a decent view of the city . My most memorable time for me would be the bar lounge in the hotel where Josh took care of everyone . For someone to work alone in a fairly busy bar and ex ##ude so much life and energy to all the guest at once was spectacular ! Great guy , great service , and I will definitely be back ! Thanks [SEP]
1	[CLS] All about the location . Perfect ##ly situated in the loop within walking distance from an eclectic selection of eat ##eries , shops , theaters and parks . Room sizes vary but will certainly feel small compared to most standard accommodation ##s . I highly recommend the Palmer House as a central location for exploring and enjoying Chicago . That said , if you are looking for much more than a clean bed & bathroom , you may be disappointed with its size and amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I paid for 2 rooms for 2 nights back in May . When I checked in , I was charged again for the rooms plus the customary $ 100 hold for each room . So , I ’ m currently looking at $ 700 “ pending ” out of my checking account . I have been told it will take 2 business days to correct . I understand errors - and I understand it was Lal ##lap ##alo ##oz ##a weekend - but the service recovery was sub par . I never heard the words , “ We are sorry for the in ##con ##ven ##ience ” from either the front desk or the manager on duty who sent a pre - set text asking how the visit was going . Very disappointing experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Door man was rude and would not return my luggage and computer bag to me because I did not have a claim ticket . The door woman who checked me in first did not give me a ticket . I complained to the manager on duty and her answer was " This is Chicago , we had many incidents of theft . That ' s why he didn ' t return your stuff " . She failed to to address the fact that the door woman wa ##d not trained properly and should have given me a claim ticket in the first place . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved the history of this hotel and the pictures in the hallway ##s were fun to look at . The p ##eel ##ing wall paper and aged , hard to work f ##au ##ce ##ts are what turned me off from this hotel . Fi ##xing both of those things would not be costly and would have made a big difference in the overall experience . I would like to see them p ##olis ##h up this g ##em ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at the So ##fit ##el for 5 nights and it was absolutely fantastic from start to finish . It is in a f ##abulous location for all the main attractions with plenty of really good bars and restaurants all within working distance , as well as plenty of shops . The hotel staff were all so helpful and friendly , especially the con ##cier ##ge helped us organize our various ex ##cursions and gave us great restaurant recommendations . The hotel bar was a great place to spend some time after a long day walking around the city and before heading back out for dinner . I am luck enough to travel all over the world with my job and this was simply the best hotel I have stayed in taking everything into account . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel with an excellent staff . Great food on site and an un ##beat ##able location . Close to shopping , dining , Navy Pier . We walked miles along the lake ##front . Book the old tower . The rooms are all unique in shape and size instead of a box ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] OK , I would give this a 5 - star , but we only enjoyed a short stay , was not able to experience any of the amenities and limited dining . Location - Can ' t beat it . Right where you want to be . Service - fantastic as always . From entering to dining and service staff . The rooms - now that I joined the Ka ##rma rewards program ( I ' d recommend BT ##W - at the very least you get free internet ) it has been enjoy ##ably curious to stay at different properties to see what funk or v ##ibe the well - branded environment em ##otes . AND for those who ' ve never been to this , or other Kim ##pton properties , it is always enjoyable to enjoy the daily free wine hour ; ) and bring the p ##oo ##ch . Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Un ##friend ##ly staff specially at the bars and restaurants on the property . Room ##s were Organ ##ized but the carpet in the room I stayed in was in a really bad shape . The bathroom was dusty and the mirror had tooth paste on the edges as if someone just wiped the middle of it . Basic ##ally an average stay but not what I expected from the H ##ya ##tt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ad ##d a few things that people love to use like a microwave , fridge and a way to get fresh air privately . Overall it was a very nice place the food was delicious , the hall ways was freezing and the conference rooms also . The staff is very welcoming . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautifully located and we had a magnificent view of the city . Everyone we encountered was welcoming and friendly . We loved the layout of the lobby and great places to sit and chat with friends or wait for rides , etc . We were there in early December and the Christmas decorations were lovely from the huge tree in the middle of the lobby to the beautiful p ##oi ##nse ##tti ##as all around the bar lounge area . All in all the room was perfect , clean and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable . We would most certainly recommend the She ##rato ##n Grand , Chicago to friends and family . Perfect location for walking as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over ##night in Chicago to do shopping , eating out etc . . . Nice location 2 blocks off of Michigan Avenue . Near the area with Di ##or , Her ##mes . Nice park , tea shop nearby . Everything within walking distance . Nice room , nice lobby , nice on ##site restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] they nail ##ed it ! everything was spot on . From the moment we checked in to the room , everything was perfect ! perfect weekend ! we were very comfortable here . The only thing I would change is the 6 ##am trash service outside in the alley but not much you can do about the city of ch ##ica ##go [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was lovely . Nice , clean hotel with at ##ten ##tive staff . A ##pp ##re ##cia ##ted the water offered at the door when coming back from a hot day in the city . However , at check ##out we were hit with your " am ##ent ##ies " per day fee . I did not see this on the paperwork and feel this is a slight handed way to get more money out of your customers . Why not add that to the night ##ly cost ( when they are cost comparing ! ) and let people leave on a happy note ? Instead I felt taken advantage of and felt I was ( again ) paying for the nice stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have worked with Victoria a couple times now . She has provided us with the B ##ES ##T customer service from the begging to the end ! ! Love her professional ##ism and knowledge ! Thank you Victoria for all your help with both of our groups ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel . De ##fin ##ite ##ly 5 star . Great views and location cannot be beat . The lobby is on the top floor which is a bit awkward but otherwise beautiful hotel with great service . Guest services over the phone could be a bit more pro ##mpt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and service , rooms are nice - sized and clean . Overall seems less luxurious with cheap appointments . Heat ##ing system is shaky - it ' s hot or cold ; my friends ' room had no heat . Food options are outrage ##ously expensive - as is every am ##eni ##ty . Park ##ing is $ 75 / day . Health club is very expensive at $ 25 / day unless you have a good Hilton Honors Status . Building itself remains gorgeous and security is strong . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always love staying at this hotel . Stay here at least 2 ##x per year . Especially love seeing the same club room staff every time we stay here . Connie , who works evening shift in club lounge is outstanding . Ex ##pect to be p ##amp ##ered when she ' s working ! Seriously best s ##p ##g club room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for shopping , dining and theatre go ##ers . Own ##er and Hilton up ##ped their game with the make ##over - very pleasant ! We chose a King room with sleep ##er sofa for our teen and were comfortable . We didn ' t use the full kitchen , but the appliances would su ##ff ##ice for a multi ##night stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very reliable hotel , well positioned for downtown meetings , some of the best restaurants in Chicago too , very cord ##ial staff and Franco ##phi ##le feeling on your travels to usually b ##land US hotel chains , plenty of French cuisine on offer too with a local twist to the fl ##av ##ours , Le Bar is superb , excellent servers and interesting characters from near and far . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On a recent business trip we stayed at Fair ##mont . Hotel staff were very nice and our room was spacious , but the place needs a re ##fu ##rb ##ishing of space and service . We had to ask for enough robes , towels , toilet ##ries , glasses , mug ##s , etc . The A / C required a fix by engineering . No shower caps or other amenities . In all , a nice hotel but not up to the level of other Fair ##mont hotels I ’ ve stayed at . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second stay at this magnificent hotel . Perfect location for walking to breakfast , lunch and dinner ! Close to everything . Bed ##ding was super com ##fy and plus ##h . S ##le ##pt like a little baby . It rain ##ed this time we were there . They even provided super cool umbrella ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel that just got better & better . Great location downtown , great continental breakfast , great happy hour ( w / a handful of free drinks ) , and free food ! . Modern rooms , great service . Would love to stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The front desk staff were wonderful ##ly a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly ; offering activity and restaurant recommendations around the area during our stay . We had a large room with great view , enjoyed the warm indoor pool and felt the location was perfect for our stay ##cation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ambassador while attending a wedding in Chicago . The location is fantastic , near all sorts of restaurants and among the most beautiful houses in the city . We did not have a car , but all our travel was easily accomplished via shirt L ##y ##ft or U ##ber rides . There is also much to see and do within walking distance . The room was clean and quiet . The bed was very comfortable . We slept well . This is an old and s ##tor ##ied hotel that is well maintained and staffed by well trained professionals . We felt that the Ambassador delivered good value for our money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel - very busy - service is wonderful - Hotel is beautiful - central ##ly located - Great restaurants - Convention area was very nice - signs directing us to the events - Nice outside service - My room was very clean and com ##fy [SEP]
1	[CLS] Melissa made our 5th stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie the best one yet . We absolutely love this place and try to find reasons to visit . After staying in several other hotels in the city , we have found our home away from home at the Ki ##nz ##ie . And much has to do with the staff . Location couldn ' t be better , the most bang for the b ##uck , and very user friendly . There ' s no reason for us to ever look for some place else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was there for Holiday Show ##case and was an excellent experience . Staff was friendly and inform ##ative on where to go for the Expo . I would definitely recommend and stay at the property again . Thank you for your kind service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It took three hours to get our luggage after check in . The bell ##man demanded a tip from my 17 year old daughter after the three hour wait . Our room was filthy with dust and left behind random garbage . The house keeping was ha ##pha ##zard . They took the shower curtain and didn ’ t replace it and made only one bed one of the nights . We left items behind and it took more than an hour to find someone to assist . By the time someone got to the room our belongings were gone . Won ’ t recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay in the Conrad on a Regular basis for work . Love the rooms [UNK] The bathroom is the highlight of the room the shower is amazing [UNK] great am ##eni ##ty Kit ##s in the room also . Electric blind ##s both black ##out and sheer which is pretty cool . The have a lovely restaurant on the 20th floor and a rooftop bar . Both are lovely to chill in and great views , but quiet expensive . Great for a night cap if you wore out in Chicago before hand . The location is amazing also . En ##joy your stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] She ##ets were not changed each day and the mattress should be replaced . I was expecting two beds in the room since there was only a king size bed the other person slept on the sofa . Not most favorable for an advertised ups ##cale hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Visiting Chicago for the first time . This hotel and staff are truly amazing . Our room was very comfortable and the staff were at ##ten ##tive to our requests . Travis Howard , the Guest Relations Manager was awesome . He was very helpful at recommend ##ing different venues and places to visit around Chicago and he booked some tours for us and suggested the best Blues House in the city . Travis also arranged for Brian a wonderful person from the engineering department to come to our room as we were having trouble with some of the plug ##s for our computer and phones . Brian ensured all the electrical was working within minutes . I will definitely return when I am back in the Wind ##y City [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome hotel : accommodation ##s , staff , food , location ! The newly renovated rooms were spacious and nicely decorated . The staff was friendly , helpful and g ##rac ##ious . We had three rooms and all our guests were happy and slept well ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful place to stay . Staff is friendly and professional . Room ##s are unique and spacious . W ##if ##i is free if you sign up for the rewards card . This is a higher end hotel so free w ##if ##i might not ex ##cite you . Vale ##t parking is $ 58 a night and no self parking options on property . You have a couple block walk for that Hotel is central ##ly located in downtown . They have loan ##er bikes this you may use as well . Very cool . I will definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed here before , as have other friends and colleagues over the years . Great location and excellent design don ' t make up for poor maintenance and under ##sta ##ffed services . I ' ll stay here again when someone in management starts to pay attention to the details that make an excellent customer experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel - more amazing staff . Had an amazing stay and Park deal that covered v ##alet parking in the room charge . Very clean and great location . Up ##graded to River ##view . P ##lent ##y to choose from in the 24 / 7 store . Work ##out facilities are second to none for hotel accommodation ##s . Also had work ##out equipment that could be taken and used in the privacy of your room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel a lot staying at H ##ya ##tt as much as possible . The Chicago H ##ya ##tt , has never disappointed me . Amazing staff , rooms have always been ready on time and very clean , Service when need is pro ##mpt as well as friendly . Price ##s within the hotel are very comparable to surrounding establishments [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is stunning ! Such a classic and historical g ##em of a hotel . All staff members were pleasant , from the front desk to the restaurant employees to the cleaning staff . Breakfast was very good too , in Lock ##wood ' s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place for a stay ##cation . Clean rooms , very nice , welcoming staff . Nice large rooms - we had a great open sitting area . And it was just one block west of Michigan Avenue . Very convenient ! ! Makes it so easy to explore ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although we are locals - we enjoy our mini stay ##cation ##s . Thanks to Hotel ##T ##oni ##ght we found an un ##believable deal at the Swiss ##ô ##tel after going to the Black ##hawks game . I ’ ve been to the hotel before for a wedding - which was beautiful and the event space at the top was gorgeous - but this was my first time staying . We were able to upgrade our room for a reasonable fee and the room was spacious and had a great view of the river and Navy Pier . They have a late check ##out - 12 ##PM which was ideal . I can work remotely so I opted to utilize the huge desk in the room to have an office with a view for a few hours . The space was clean , bed com ##fy - bathroom was decent sized , and had a small sitting area . This hotel is close to everything in the loop . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hands down the best hotel I ' ve stayed at in Chicago and the only one I will return to ! The staff are very friendly and knowledge ##able ! I only travel once a month but everyone remembers me , makes me feel at home ! The room is always perfectly clean . The bed is comfortable and there is actually enough pillows on the bed ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my fourth time in Chicago , but first time staying at the Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco Chicago . I was on the tenth floor and with a view of the river . From my arrival , the staff was incredibly helpful . They seemed sincere ##ly invested in my experience at the hotel and my experience in Chicago . I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for to have a nice time in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location was great but everything other than that was just okay . Nothing special . i didn ' t like entering and then having to go up an elevator instead of entering into a lobby . The breakfast didn ' t have much variety was just very basic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean . Kitchen was equipped . Staff were great . Location is superb . Will be staying again when reviews are still okay . . . . . Love the place so much . Value of room is reasonable . Its a great place if you plan to meet friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my first stay in Chicago . the location was within walking distance to most things I wanted to visit . The front desk staff is great and willing to answer any questions . We were on the 19th floor and our room was very quiet . The rooms are on the small side but I expect that in most large cities . I loved being able to take out the bikes to explore the city . Be ##come a Kim ##pton rewards member as it comes with many per ##ks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great place to stay with an amazing staff . I was treated extremely well . The location is perfect and it ' s a few block from Michigan avenue . The navy pier is about 5 blocks so no need for a taxi . Everything you need is with in walking distance . Evening social is very well presented and provided with class . They have a staff that is top notch and is quick to provide anything to make your stay great . The rooms are nice and well stock ##ed with the things you need to cook your meals . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Last year we had issues with this hotel . In 2018 they made up for it . A great location . At ##ten ##tive staff . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms Michael Jordan restaurant and bar . The only thing missing is an Intercontinental VIP room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently spent 2 days at the Fair ##mont for business . Let me start by saying the location is f ##abulous . Close proximity to the river , Lake Michigan , as well as Michigan Avenue . Also , as can be expected with Fair ##mont , the service and amenities ( gym ) did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint , nor did the food . The hotel itself is slightly dated and could use some T ##LC . However , for the price , it was fine . The rooms are slightly larger than others you ' ll find in Chicago . P ##ric ##ing for food , v ##alet , and drink is high , but it is what it is . Overall , nice hotel and I ' d likely stay again when traveling for work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wrong room assignment . I didn ' t get the upgrade I paid for . To fix the problem I had to go back to the Lo ##bby and stand in the check out line again . The Vale ##t the next morning would not accept calls to bring cars to front of hotel , even though that was the direction when dropping cars off on previous night . The new " Text Con ##cier ##ge " was un ##res ##po ##ns ##ive and slow with answering , and gave the wrong information . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful , inviting , s ##ty ##lish . The staff was amazing . F ##abulous location . For some reason , we were out in a suite ? Living area separate from the bedroom . The gentleman at the front desk was having a good night ? High ##ly recommend ( even without secret upgrades ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##bs ##ol ##ute delight to stay ! Very friendly staff and court ##eous through out . Walk out n to the right you have convenient access to the blue n red lines to hop on to get back to Midway or O ’ Hare airports . There ’ s a bunch of shopping as well a good corridor to walk to the Naval Pier . Walk out n to the left is all the restaurants you can feast as well as access to business . Your bound to enjoy your stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ m in Chicago for business at least 2 times a month and have stayed in many hotels but the Talbot ##t is my favorite . Love the de ##cor , it has a high end feel with reasonable prices and pre - co ##vid , the restaurant and bar atmosphere was amazing . Hope that comes back soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Though it is a business hotel , our Diamond Member family enjoyed our stay here . They can seem to ni ##ckle and dim ##e you for meals but the kids ' meals were amazing - scrambled eggs and tons for crisp ##y bacon and f ##rench toast was off the hook . G ##RE ##AT quality food so for $ 6 , what ##ev ##s ! Room ##s were clean and com ##fy and the location was so prime , we couldn ' t have asked for better . De ##fin ##ite ##ly would recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had two suites and even with how busy the hotel was , they still took the time to get our two suites near each other . Their breakfast b ##uff ##et was wonderful . It had everything from o ##at ##me ##al to scrambled eggs , sa ##usage links and pat ##ties . Fresh bag ##els , 3 types of bread , pan ##cakes with all the trim ##ming ##s and juice and ice ##d water . Also , a large bowl of fresh fruit . And two coffee stations . The lobby area was a great space for gathering to visit and chat . It is a very inviting space . We will definitely re ##book with the Home ##wood Suite ##s by Hilton . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are dated , small and in a very boring part of town . Staff was not friendly and construction began on the walls at 8 ##am . Be ##ware of this before booking . Staff should not ##ify you before the date of check ##in that there is going to be loud drilling outside your room , beginning at 8 ##am . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Annual ##ly , my so ##ro ##rity hosts an event at this H ##ya ##tt and I ' m never disappointed . The rooms are really nice , the am ##bian ##ce is warm and welcoming - I always enjoy my stay . For those traveling to Chicago , this hotel is close to the Ma ##g Mile and if you can , get a view of the great sky ##line of my beautiful city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In short : Staff and service are good like other Hilton ##s . The rooms are somewhat out ##dated , especially the shower ##s . Very fancy and plus ##h lobby . Big hotel , there are quite a lot of . Location is pretty good , inside the loop , close to shopping mainly , and not too far from the river and Millennium park . Value for price is just okay . I ' d expect just a little more I guess for the price , however it ' s probably due to the location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has been around for almost a hundred years for a reason . But I ' m sick of hotels offering all these " free " amenities . If you book a standard room , you don ' t get any per ##ks , if you book a standard room with a wireless package you get free w ##if ##i . Or a standard room with the breakfast package , you get free breakfast - come on [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel w the big window seats & awesome views . Great location , and a free wine hour can ' t be beat . Friendly welcoming staff too . But w ##ow , the free hot chocolate in the afternoon was und ##rin ##ka ##ble this visit , and when I asked for a blanket I think they must have thought it was for a dog at this pet friendly hotel - - it was that awful . And no more loan ##er fish for the pet ##less , or mine got lost in transit . That said , I ' ll come back in a heart beat . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first time staying at this property and I really enjoyed myself . The view , the food and the service were all amazing ! ! My room was exceptional . This place is a whole city within itself . Downtown Chicago is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed here with 6 of our kids during a December weekend in the city . The hotel staff was friendly and the breakfast b ##uff ##et was quite good with a wide variety of offerings . The pull ##out bed in the living area wasn ' t the greatest for a 200 lb plus adult but all in all this was a solid hotel choice at a good price . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay here . All staff were a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and professional . One employee in particular , " Brittany " was very friendly and joy ##ful as she assisted us during breakfast . It help set the tone for our day . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ m a diamond member with Hilton and prefer to stay here because of the quality and usually service . However upon checking in at the Hilton Chicago everything was fine , I was given breakfast coup ##ons and told we had access to the gym . The following morning breakfast went fine but my son was ha ##rassed at the gym and told he had no access . He has to argue with the attendant for 10 ##min to get access and then she was very rude to him . We are still staying here and I will update as new issues happen . I have included a picture of some dirty plates at the breakfast b ##uff ##et . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel features everything you need for a vacation ! The pool is clean , they offer a nice fitness center , and the food at the restaurant is amazing ! It ' s location is perfect for walking to the local attractions or designer stores ! I would definitely recommend the O ##m ##ni hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , the bathroom was luxurious , and the staff was amazing ( K ##wa ##me at check - in made it the best hotel - desk experience ever ) . The property has vintage charm without feeling " old " or run - down , so there were no hi ##cc ##ups during our stay . We ' ll definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here the last 5 y ##rs for RS ##NA . The bus pickup / drop - off at the All ##erton is just across Michigan Ave ( 1 block walk ) . Too bad the Apple Store and C ##rate & Barr ##ell stores moved further away . I love the central location on Michigan Ave . and that the rooms are all suites with a separate living room . In 5 y ##rs , I have had no issues at all . Very comfortable bed and the the ##rm ##ost ##ats are NO ##T locked out ( I like to sleep in a cooled room ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very large hotel with two towers , convenient location in downtown Chicago . Right on W ##ack ##er , close to Met ##ra , 10 - 15 min walk to El . Walk to magnificent mile . Walk to lakes ##hore / parks . Room ##s are very nice , with big windows , though views o ##bs ##truct ##ed by other tall buildings around , unless you ' re looking North . I would avoid the West tower - - not enough elevators . Wait ##s can get very long at busy times . Bar on 2nd level in main lobby has lots of screens , any game . Dr ##ink ##s are expensive but not crazy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Of all the inter ##continent ##al hotels in major us cities , this one has to be on the block for a re ##f ##resh of sort . The front desk staff was a bit too sur ##ly for my taste . I almost got confused whether I was at a holiday inn by the way the front desk def ##lected a simple question about directions to a local bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here on business trip . Great location and very comfortable room . Easy walk to major sights . I didn ' t get to use the extensive hotel facilities unfortunately . Ice ##d water with c ##itrus available throughout the day in reception . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience at the Ambassador . Super friendly staff . Room was very nice and quiet . The hotel has a good happy hour and offers travel ##er discount ##s . In a great spot for walking to multiple dinner locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hotel is an historic place that has been restored and updated to a 4 star hotel in the midst of the downtown . Great location , walking distance to just about everything . P ##lent ##y of restaurants close ##by and the elevated rail system is right out the side door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room itself was clean , comfortable and quiet . We had a nice view of the city and river . Although there was certainly nothing wrong with the room , it just seemed a bit dated . I think some up ##dating would turn the room from nice to great . The staff were friendly and helpful . The pool was nice , though a bit crowded the evening we went . The food at the breakfast b ##uff ##et was good . The hotel is in a great location with easy access to both the Loop and the North Michigan Ave . shops and restaurants . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend and it was nice and quiet . When we arrived the hotel staff was very friendly . The rooms were very clean and the views were AM ##A ##Z ##ING on the top floor ! The bed was firm but comfortable to me . This hotel was in a great location and I would recommend to anyone wanting to have a great stay in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for two nights for a business trip . It was just 3 blocks from my office building on W . W ##ack ##er . Staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and allowed me to check in around 1 ##pm after arriving early . Room was clean , modern and comfortable , included small refrigerator in room . Extra ##s included a nice continental breakfast with fruit , da ##nish , past ##ries , bag ##els , hard boiled eggs and cold cereal ##s , coffee and tea . Evening reception / Happy hour each day from 5 - 7 ##pm included choice of 2 draft beers and wines , included light snack ##s ( pub mix and trail mix ) Not the greatest reception , but cannot beat the convenience and it ' s free . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The 67 ##6 restaurant was very enjoyable so we had breakfast there every morning . The French toast and the o ##mel ##ettes are delicious . Breakfast meat ##s are very good and the chef prepared j ##elli ##es preserves and re ##lish ##es are del ##ec ##table . The staff is very friendly and at ##ten ##tive couldn ' t ask for more . We also had room service one evening and ordered the signature ground rib ##eye b ##urger it was perfect . I would highly recommend it . The hotel is on the magnificent mile and with in walking distance of many attractions , restaurants and shopping . You do not require a car . We used v ##alet parking which is perfect and a great value if you take advantage of the free breakfast v ##ou ##cher that is offered . We would definitely do it again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel . Every night had wine hour . In the morning co ##ffe and hot tea waiting for you . During the day there was re ##f ##rea ##shing water and tea . Great location . The rooms could be bigger . The Windows sit was great to watch the people . Very quite . I hated you had to paid for w ##if ##i . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our stay in Chicago at the H ##ya ##tt Regency was outstanding . We attended a conference that was outstanding . The food , the facilities , the staff and accommodation ##s were all outstanding . I cannot recommend this hotel more , it was perfect . Everyone we came in contact with was professional and helpful . Thanks for a great trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 3 nights and loved the location . Close to parks , subway & bus stops . Star ##bu ##cks and restaurants on site . Only complaint was no mini fridge in room so you have to call to have them bring one up - Which did come up promptly ! You can walk around and see the history of one of the oldest hotels in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for the weekend for a wedding . It was one of the suggested hotels . The location was awesome . It made things easy to go shopping or to a restaurant . The bed was extremely uncomfortable . I woke up several times at night trying to ease my back pain . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Two complaints is that they did not have enough staff working when checking in . The line was about 8 people deep , and there was one train ##ee working . Also , our bill was wrong . They did am ##end it before we left but it was a trip to reception which is just kind of annoying . This place is right on the magnificent mile , walking distance to John Hancock building , navy pier and millennium park . We were in the executive tower and even though the beds were full size , there was plenty of extra walking room . If given a choice , up ##grading to executive is 100 % worth it . My room complaints is there is a lack of lighting and garbage cans . We would come back and recommend to others . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We chose this hotel because of the super convenient location in the city . The room was clean but nothing crazy considering the price . The staff was nice but always seemed to be in a hurry . They didn ' t take the time to explain things to you , not because they were un ##friend ##ly , but because they seemed overwhelmed . Overall it was a good experience but for a similar price I would consider staying somewhere else with a little more atmosphere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were exceptional . Bed ##s were The suites were spacious , clean and extremely comfortable . Hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful . When we arrived our refrigerator wasn ' t working . We reported it to hotel staff . When we returned from dinner , it still wasn ' t working . Maintenance came right away with a new refrigerator . The maintenance man said he had re ##set it while we were out , but obviously that hadn ' t worked . The front desk sent up a large bag of ice . So all was well . The free breakfast was more than adequate . The eggs weren ' t great but all the rest was very good . The hotel is within walking distance of the navy pier . I would whole ##heart ##edly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is my second time visiting the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago , it has beautiful views of the river and its in a great location to downtown shopping and eating . The hotel has a great work ##out facility and an indoor pool . I will be back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay . . super friendly folks . . asked for D ##wayne at the door for all you could ever ask for in service . As a con ##cier ##ge , Tim is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . Never misses a “ trick ” . . . Both are i ##rre ##place ##able . . Tom Tim ##ber ##lake Misty P ##eh ##l 5 / 14 - 17 , / 2019 [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 2 + weeks , and I couldn ' t be happier with my stay ( the only thing that made me unhappy was having to check out ) . I chose the Hotel Monaco because I needed a place to stay with my dog ( no breed restrictions , ho ##ora ##y ! ) , and it ended up being just perfect for us . Mabel the p ##oo ##ch loved the dog bed they supplied ( and also the people bed ) , and we both loved the easy access to the River Walk ( thanks to a mild February , we had some lovely walks along the river to Navy Pier ) . The staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and the room was nice and comfortable . The rate ( I got an extended stay rate because of the length of my stay ) was also very reasonable . I don ' t know what else to add - it was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I researched my stay in Chicago prior to arriving and this location received great reviews . I will confirm that the reviews were indeed correct , the place was great ! As an s ##p ##g owner , I was impressed at the service I received . We arrived early , around 10 ' is ##h and asked for an early check ##in , it was granted . Ya ##y ! ! Our room was so great , with f ##abulous view . The hotel is right along the river walk , we spent a few nights just sitting & watching the boats go by . The location is perfect as everything is within walking distance . Great place , would totally recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were looking forward to staying here since the location was great but the house ##keeping was not what we expected . They didn ' t clean the ice bucket or replaced the liner . I had to leave a note so the liner could be replaced and also had to ask for toilet ##ries which were not left in the bathroom . I am returning for a conference later this year at the H ##ya ##tt so I hope I have a better experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful location with great renovated rooms . Breakfast was by far the best I ' ve had at a hotel . The evening so ##xial was great for app ##eti ##zers and drinks before heading out to dinner . Location was convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was staying here for the AP Conference and it was great . The room was nice and clean . Wonderful location , walking distance to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave . It has a nice lobby bar with good app ##eti ##zers and price ##y drinks . Conference rooms were nice too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel lobby is beautiful and truly feels historic . It ’ s where the brown ##ie was created and can be purchase with recipe included . The rooms are alright nothing spectacular , they have the same feel as the lobby for the most part , the shower doesn ’ t have enough water pressure in my opinion . It ’ s close to lots of shopping and has lots restaurants down stairs . The hotels nice but for the cost there are lots of good options for less in my opinion . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here one night just to hang ##out downtown . We used a Group ##on and got a good price . I don ' t know that paying the extra money for a Deluxe City View King room was worth it though for 2 reasons : 1 . The hotel isn ' t that tall so your view in general is nothing to write home about 2 . We didn ' t spend that much time in our room . That being said the hotel is clean , the personnel are nice , and it ' s in a G ##RE ##AT location . It was fairly chill ##y out yet we still managed to walk to several bars / restaurants ( Harry Cara ##ys , Public House , Sullivan ' s , O ' Call ##agh ##an ' s ) in the area . I would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ; close enough to restaurants , the shore line , etc . without the massive bust ##le of middle of downtown . Clean , well - appointed , comfortable rooms . Good internet . Pleasant staff . An excellent value . I always stay at this hotel when visiting Chicago . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about this bout ##ique hotel was on point . House ##keeping kept the room exceptionally clean every day of our five day stay . The door ##men were always friendly and welcoming especially Perry . Most of all , we were grateful to Tan ##ar at the front desk for his assistance and open ##ness with anything we needed during the stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Me and my wife needed assistance from staff due to religious reasons . The staff showed their willingness , care , and knowledge from previous experience on how to assist us . They were happy to help with everything we needed and we ' re friendly the entire time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came to Chicago for the first time to cheer for my friends running the marathon . The location is about 17 miles from the airport , but about an hour train and bus ride away . The room was very spacious and clean . There was nothing wrong with my stay , but I think I will book my Chicago stay elsewhere for next year ' s marathon - - somewhere closer to Grant park and closer to the train . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we checked in , I knew it looked very different than what I remember , having previously stayed here ! ! When I inquired , the staff said it was a whole new place , 2 blocks down from the previous ! ! ! Who knew ? ? It is beautiful , and the rooms are quite nice ! ! The plus ##ses include : high tech wall controls for lights , window shades and air . We had a spacious 2 queen bedroom with a great sized t ##v ! ! Bed ##s were very comfortable ! ! Downs ##ide : difficult to get I N ##d out of the tub / shower . I ’ m 5 ’ , but even my tall son had a hard time ! ! ! Beautiful rooftop bar ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband had a conference in Chicago , so my son & I tag ##ged along to sights ##ee while he was there . We stayed 4 nights at the Palmer House Hilton and had a wonderful time . The room was spacious & provided 2 closet ##s to hang clothes . The historical aspect of the place was phenomena ##l ! Beautiful architecture and design . 2 of the restaurants located in the hotel were delicious . Price ##y , but I have come to expect that in hotels , especially in Chicago . I would glad ##ly stay here again whenever I return to the Wind ##y City . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I absolutely love the So ##fit ##el , I started staying about 2 years ago and can ' t get enough of their wonderful hospitality . Everyone is so welcoming and friendly . You feel you are someone special the minute you arrive . I love their prices for what you are getting . The rooms are great size and some of them have a huge soaking tub that makes relaxing even better . I will be back again next week and I ' m looking forward to my holiday break . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall a good hotel with an excellent location . The hotel rooms were renovated and updated . Fitness center was excellent with an indoor track , lap pool , hot tub , sa ##una , exercise machines , weights , etc . Room service was spot ##ty and needed improvement . Central ##ly located - - would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is historic and has a beautiful lobby . Our executive rooms were clean . The room layout was practical and the beds comfortable . However , I observed long check - in lines and the breakfast b ##uff ##et on the 23rd floor was under ##sta ##ffed and could not keep up with putting out food and cleaning up the dishes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was visiting family in Chicago . I am disabled and needed ( and booked ) an accessible room - - in particular , an accessible bathroom . I arrived at the hotel and was impressed with the lovely lobby . I went up to my room and discovered that , while there was a level shower in my bathroom , it was not a roll in shower , and did not have grab bars . I called the front desk , and they worked to find me another room . I went to check that out . . . bath ##tub . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not accessible . I went down to the front desk to ask what could be done . In the end the best they could promise me was that they ' might ' have a room with an accessible bathroom for my second night . In the end they re ##fu ##nded me for my entire stay , but the experience was f ##rust ##rating . [SEP]
0	[CLS] While the main lobby is still pretty my room was cramped and ta ##ttered . This may have been pretty in its hey ##day but those days are clearly long gone . The room service was solid and thoughtful , and the other service was at ##ten ##tive . I won ’ t be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No early check in , no per ##ks , no hotel car , and no spa . Only the bell staff made this trip enjoyable - they were wonderful ! Door ##man is excellent , knowledge ##able of area offerings , and very at ##ten ##tive . Off ##ered me a bottle of water on arrival , as well as while waiting for ride . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff are very professional and friendly , the rooms are clean and beautiful . the location and facilities are just outstanding . I loved the view from my room , I was able to see the lake and the ferry . and the cleaning crew always ready to serve and help . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visit the USA regularly for business . My company has a deal with Kim ##pton ##s in most cities . However while some of them are lacking , the Monaco is my favourite one to stay in . All the staff are so friendly and helpful . The rooms are larger than usual . It ' s very central and much better than the sister hotel the All ##egro . I am a woman travel ##ler on my own , and here I feel completely safe , other locations are not the same . Great place [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wayne Wayne Wayne ! ! This man deserves a trophy for best customer service ! ! Our stay at the ambassador was amazing thanks to the great service and polite staff . Room ##s were excellent and very clean . We will definitely be staying here on our future visits to the wind ##y city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed this hotel even though we didn ' t have time to explore all that it had to offer . The hotel is convenient ##ly located near shopping , restaurants , a Big Bus Stop , attractions and Soldier Field . The rooms are spacious and decorated nicely . With so many elevators , there is never a wait . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location on the loop . Walk ##ed to mill ##ine ##um park , art institute , Michigan avenue and most restaurants . Sports bar across the street . Pro ##se ##cco happy hour ! Lo ##bby bar inviting . Art Dec ##o de ##cor was cool . Room was comfortable . . . Bath small . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location in Chicago ’ s Gold Coast area . Excellent venue for either business or leisure stay . If you like an ups ##cale hotel with a French fl ##air this is a great choice . Good corporate rates and other pro ##mo deals available [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our first visit to this bout ##ique hotel won ' t be our last ! My daughter and I were in town for a family friend ' s baby shower and to celebrate my birthday . From the time we arrived at the hotel , we were treated like royalty from the v ##alet parking to the folks at the front desk , we couldn ' t have asked for better service . The room was lavish ##ly appointed and the beds were super com ##fy . We ' re planning to return this summer if not before . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago while attending a wedding down the street . It was an ideal location with wonderful views . The staff could not have been nice ##r and more a ##cco ##mo ##dating . We are platinum members and very few hotels treat us like a platinum member , but this She ##rato ##n absolutely did . I would highly recommend the hotel and we can ' t wait to go back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we arrived at the property we were greeted with sincere smiles and " Welcome home ! " from the door ##man , Larry . We received the exact same treatment at the front desk as we checked in . ( It is S ##O very nice to be remembered and recognized as a returning guest ( 9 stays in 18 months ) . We stayed on the Executive Level and had an issue with the H ##VA ##C in our room . Within minutes of our call to the Guest Services Hot ##line , the engineering staff arrived and resolved the issue . Ernest , the Executive Lounge host , is an absolute RA ##Y OF S ##UN ##S ##H ##IN ##E . I highly recommend Palmer House to any Chicago visitors ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed the night as part of a company holiday trip . Beautiful accommodation ##s . I know they want to make money with their in room snack ##s but they are so ridiculous ##ly priced . Overall would keep it in my options for staying at again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco is a great location . We took the Orange line to and from MD ##W airport . There is a train stop just around the corner . We had a two bed queen room , the room was very spacious facing the parking garage . The room had a refrigerator that we were able to keep our waters cold . House ##keeping always did a great job . We stayed four nights . The hotel is a short walk to mill ##ennial park and the bean . We visited all sites , navy pier , bean , Adler aquarium , planet ##arium and the field museum , John Hancock Tower 360 Tower , Willis Tower , sail ##boat rides , architectural tour ’ s . We really enjoyed the city of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel ! Right on Michigan Avenue and compliment ##ary juice and coffee in the morning . High ##ly recommended for its location , comfort , beauty and service ! There ’ s also a fitness center , restaurant in the hotel and glorious Lake Michigan ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Location . Friendly and Help ##ful staff . We arrived early and Jason , was able to get us into a room early . That goes a long way . Breakfast was the standard , except no W ##af ##fle ##s on the weekend , why ? Also , one of two elevators was out of service for a majority of the time we were there . this was a little in ##con ##ven ##ient , but we just added additional time to plans to leave the hotel for our many trips out and about . There should have been some notice posted or communications to the guest . We didn ' t find out until we asked . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful Hotel and location ! Would stay again in a heartbeat . Friendly staff and breakfast b ##uff ##et was really good . Very close to so many attractions . . . shopping , Millennium Park Christmas Tree , Macy ' s , and so many more things to keep you coming back [SEP]
1	[CLS] We moved to this hotel after a ho ##rri ##d experience at another downtown hotel and so glad we did . Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful - including some personal suggestions for our activities which seemed done with genuine care . The whole hotel is beautifully done , including our room . The room was clean , comfortable with gorgeous art de ##co feel . There is free coffee from the lobby in the morning and free Pro ##se ##cco in the evening ( which they were really generous with ) . Great location in the busy theatre district but our room was still nice and quiet . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for two nights while we toured around Chicago . It was a great location though I couldn ' t figure out at first why we always missed Michigan avenue when we were walking ( E Grand goes under it ) . The rooms are large and clean . There is a small but full kitchen with a large fridge which was nice . The breakfast ##s were ta ##sty and a good way to start the day . Would definitely stay here again . Special shout out to Manager Jason Park who email ##ed me at ~ 113 ##0 am to let me know they had a room ready if we wanted to check in as we had arrived on an 8 AM flight to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After Amtrak landed in Chicago 2 hours and 20 minutes late , we were given overnight accommodation ##s at Swiss ##ote ##l . Beautiful hotel located along the River ##walk ! Well done Amtrak ! The Con ##cier ##ge , Burn ##ard , was absolutely the best ! So helpful and understanding ! His recommendations were spot on ! Our rooms were excellent . The staff was friendly and helpful . High ##ly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] So ##fit ##el is located in downtown Chicago and walking distance to great retail , restaurants and Lake Michigan . The staff at the front desk , especially Elizabeth , Gabriel , Ka ##sha , are very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The guest services staff , especially Marie and V ##erne , are know ##led ##gable and most kind . The bar staff , Jeremy , Stephanie and Julian , are amazing because no matter how busy the bar gets , they are at ##ten ##tive and most enjoyable . The restaurant staff is warm , at ##ten ##tive and lovely , especially Helen , End ##re , In ##g ##re and Andre . Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed our stay at the So ##fit ##el . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great experience . We were upgraded upon arrival which was a welcome bonus after a 8 hour flight . It would have scored excellent except the rooms are just a little small . However , con ##cier ##ge were very helpful , and the sitting out area in the front of the hotel is perfect for drinking a coffee or a wine - but the service was just a little bit slow . Location is perfect - just 5 minute walk from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfectly situated right in the heart of downtown . its got views of the lake and is easily walk ##able to shed ##ds , Field , art museum , ad ##ler plan ##ata ##rium and more . there are several restaurants and other great activities nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic amenities . The spa is a truly wonderful thing . The staff was exceptional . Vita ##ly and Melissa were f ##abulous . I enjoyed my sea ##weed wrap with Vita ##ly and wax ##ing with Melissa . Check in and check out was great too . Just a wonderful end to a long business trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the O ##m ##ni and had a great mini vacation / business trip . Walk ##ed around Michigan Ave , did a Cruise off Navy pier , great visit . Very clean city , and love the flowers that are planned around the town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , very clean rooms and free breakfast and internet ! The location is awesome , and the v ##alet and luggage service from the curb was very nice . Fe ##lt like an ups ##cale hotel for the family . Only issue was there is no room service and the v ##alet parking is expensive . I would recommend using the app Spot Hero and finding a cheaper option for the car . We got the corner room on a top floor and the view was amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A wonderful nights stay . The staff was welcoming and friendly . Lots of good dining option in the hotel and nearby . Super clean . This was an easy U ##ber ride from Union Station . High ##ly recommended and great off season rates . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything worked like a well oil ##ed machine . Room was very nice and clean , excellent fitness center , staff was helpful and friendly - overall a great location for the conference . The layout of the hotel was open and modern with lots of areas to meet with friends and colleagues . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our 2nd stay here . . First time a year ago was great . This trip , lobby and front desk staff were rude , in ##different , or just not interested in helping at all . Watch ##ed door ##men ignore a hand ##ica ##pped woman as she struggled with hand ##ica ##pped door , we helped her ! Check in at front desk was unpleasant , young woman rude . Room ##s are great , clean , quiet . House ##keeping staff very nice . Free W ##i ##F ##i is a plus from last year when it was not . . It ' s really a beautiful property , to bad the lobby staff wreck ##s it . We ' ll be looking at other hotels for our next trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We appreciated the upgrade to a larger room , and the bowl of fruit which welcomed us . We were in town for a special event . The event organizers had made arrangements with the hotel to be the recommended place to stay for delegates . The front staff were always welcoming and friendly . The bar staff less so . We had problems with the shower p ##lum ##bing , but since we did not complain , nothing was done about it . The hotel is well located with respect to shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On about 7 occasions I have stayed at The So ##fit ##el . Price ##s are rather low given the location and style . It is very French . The v ##alet parking guys and front desk staff are all extremely welcoming , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and efficient . For example , very early check ins and late check outs are possible . Chicago ' s best breakfast is here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel . The location was fantastic . Close to pretty much everything . The hotel was clean and well maintained . Stay ##ed for 3 nights . Staff at the front desk and con ##cier ##ge were friendly and helpful . House ##keeping did a lovely job . Only gave 4 stars because I didn ’ t like that you had to pay daily for w ##if ##i . That ’ s pretty ridiculous . Should be included [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August and loved how close it is to Michigan Ave for restaurants and shopping . It ' s just a short walk to Rush Street and River North . The rooms are spacious , the beds are very comfortable , and it ' s a short walk to the Sign ##ature Room for drinks . Don ' t miss a chance to see the view from the Sign ##ature Room ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The pool is section ##ed off for lap swimming and families are forced to use 1 / 3rd of the pool . There is no executive lounge even with an executive floor room . The per ##k for Hilton Gold members for breakfast is a [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has a great River North location and the rooms were perfect and had clean , spacious bathroom ##s . The staff was very friendly and helpful . The breakfast on each floor was a great touch and allows you to eat in the comfort of your own room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice modern rooms and a good breakfast are ne ##gated by the property ' s many floors being served by only 2 elevators . At peak times it is a competition between guests to get up and down . While management said that this is in part due to a service elevator being out of service , it is hard to see that being enough to solve the problem . To sole this we took 15 flights of stairs several times . When checking out , it took us 20 minutes to get an elevator . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie for two days for a quick trip . The staff was friendly and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Thank you to staff Mona and Derrick for going the extra mile to make our stay great ! We will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel us in a great location right downtown just blocks from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Every side of the hotel has great sky ##line views , especially at night . Con ##ven ##ient v ##alet parking right on the curb and inside the front door . Check in is up on the 6th floor . The de ##cor is a bit cold and un ##fe ##elin ##g there and up in the room . While we got a suite it was very cramped for the four of us for 3 nights . So not an amazing place but relatively nice . Price point was very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is just off State street , walking distance to the Bean , to mill ##eni ##um park , and to the loop in general . Super co ##zy room , had a great city view , I really like how small it is because it doesn ' t feel small , it ' s not trying hard to seem big nor is it barely decorated that the minimal ##ism concept borders emptiness . Staff was great , a con ##cier ##ge was super friendly and recommended us places to visit and eat and of course how to get there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room layout has to be one of the best we ' ve seen in the U . S . - and we travel quite a bit . Everything was logical and seemed to have been planned for the room . Bed was comfortable . Show ##er was good - two shower heads ! A continental breakfast was included ; American style yo ##gu ##rts , pre - packaged bag ##els , fruit , boiled eggs , m ##uff ##ins , coffee and juice . Also included , was a happy hour with drinks and p ##lent ##iful app ##eti ##zers ; with an up - charge for any non - standard drinks . Our only recommendation would be to improve sound proof ##ing between rooms ( blind ##s are very noisy being raised and lower ) and being able to change the H ##VA ##C blow ##er speed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Weekend trip with extended family . Great hotel , great location . The staff was very at ##ten ##tive and helped a ##cco ##mo ##date our large group . We have scheduled another visit in July . The only very minor negative was only one working elevator with the other being down due to maintenance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed the hotel ' s clean , comfortable room . Staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Hotel is close to Field Museum so we had an enjoyable s ##tro ##ll there and back . Would absolutely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here once with friends and another time with family . The rooms are not super big but they are co ##zy . Very comfortable bed and pillows . Will definitely stay here again as customer service is awesome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room had spectacular views but the de ##cor was d ##rab and dated and must ##y . The reservation process was challenging as I was given 3 different prices by 3 different people and still the reservation was incorrect and I paid more than quoted [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel stayed for four nights . excellent staff , good restaurant food and value . Very convenient to every thing within walking distance to food theaters and parks . I would stay there again the staff was very friendly and helpful [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ’ ve stayed at other hotels for twice the price around the same area and found this one to outs ##hine them all . Where old world charm meets modern design aesthetics ! Very clean rooms and bathroom ##s . Will stay here for our future business trips . Staff was very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The hotel is only a block couple of blocks west of shops of North Michigan Avenue and walk ##able to excellent restaurants in the area ! Very pleased ! Thank you [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is by far the best hotel in the Loop . I have stayed at many of them ( over 20 ) and this one far exceeds the others . The entire stay was perfect ! The location is perfect as well . We will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed there for 1 night during my visit to Chicago . The location is really good as its central ##ly located and walking distance to the main tourist areas . I got an early check in after a long flight from Delhi which was a big relief . The rooms are spacious and nicely done . The hotel is 4 * and value for money , and I would definitely recommend it . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely love this hotel , the staff was super court ##eous & helpful . After mi ##sp ##lacing my phone Connie Alex from the con ##cier ##ge lounge turned it into security for me . I would recommend to everyone and cannot wait to stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] K ##wa ##me at the front desk and Craig who took care of our luggage were so helpful ! Made our visit very easy and enjoyable . The room was up to date and comfortable . Love ##d the shower . You can ' t beat the location of this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent two nights at this central ##ly located hotel in the theatre district . It was completely noise - free . The room was small , but that was expected . Beautiful lobby . Staff was extremely professional , pleasant , and efficient . We also appreciated the daily , free New York Times . What really impressed me was the bed . It was so comfortable I sought out the Kim ##pton store to see if it can be purchased ! We will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was excited to stay here until I walked into my room . Super small . E ##ar ##p ##lug ##s left in night stand to keep from hearing construction on the hotel . Bath ##room even smaller . Small ##est I have ever been in . To ##we ##ls of motel 6 quality . Sur ##prise mini bar charge even though I didn ’ t have anything . Just a very average hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic location . Everything you need within a block or two . Red Line , grocery store and Michigan A ##v . are all right there . What would have been an ' excellent ' rating was spoiled by : A very b ##land choice of items in the inclusive breakfast . A useless exercise bike in the fitness room ( OK the pedal ##s turned but nothing else worked on it ! ! ) No CNN or other news channels on any of the screens in the fitness room . C ' mon ! ? ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town for a concert at Chicago Theater . Very convenient location . Park ##ing expensive , but not as bad as some . Room was reasonably updated and clean , but kept charm and q ##ui ##rks of older building . Bar ##s are fun . Be aware that hotel taxes in Chicago are outrage ##ous , so get " all in " price when booking to avoid stick ##er shock . Staff is very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Worth the extra cost . My son has food all ##er ##gies and they accommodate ##d his requests . Le Lab ##o amenities are incredible . Room ##s are clean . Location is awesome ! Free r ##icks ##haw rides are a nice added touch as are the free BMW bike rental ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thank you to all H ##ya ##tt employees that I encountered . Professional ##ism was top notch . If I had to rate anything lower than excellent it would be the bed . It was very hard to turn over in . Also I didn ' t check the alarm clock and the alarm was set for 6 ##am which was the perfect time however the time was set 30 minutes fast . This was my first trip to Chicago and I would of loved to had some time to sit see a bit but that has nothing to do with this review . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s in a really great location and found lots of free parking near by . Its a few blocks away from the lake shore and you can rent bikes from the hotel . Staff were extremely nice and rooms were clean and comfortable . I definitely recommend staying at the Ambassador Hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for one night in May , for a conference across the street . The hotel was convenient , comfortable , and everyone I encountered was truly fantastic . From check in to check out , the staff made the trip a joy . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend . Also , you can ' t beat the location , and there were plenty of great restaurants , bars and shops close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I held a retirement party in the King Arthur Court Ball ##room for my company ' s Chairman of the Board . The room , the decoration , and the food were all amazing . The Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal staff was very professional , kind , and easy to work with . I worked with Tara , catering sales manager . She was very thoughtful and thorough . She answered all my questions , made wonderful suggestions , and was fun to work with to plan this event . This hotel is just breath ##taking with its history and dramatic rooms . Everything was just perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff in the hotel were quite rude & un ##hel ##pf ##ul . They are not friendly or approach ##able & every ##thi ##s like too much trouble for them . The reception staff are the worst , there ' s only one helpful friendly guy who ' s really nice [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love Kim ##pton Hotels ! I normally stay at the Thompson when I ' m in Chicago , but I wanted to be closer into town . Saw this g ##em online and decided to try it out . Love ##d it ! For $ 350 per night though , free breakfast would be a nice touch . Very elegant and g ##lam design . Made me feel like I was in an old Hollywood movie ! Try it out if you ' re willing to s ##p ##lu ##rge a bit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice staff and compliment ##ary prose ##cco . Great location for theater district . Easy wa ##ling to Michigan a ##ve . Were very helpful in putting rooms next door for my father . He enjoyed the stay at age 92 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location , close to so many restaurants and entertainment . Staff was friendly and helpful . Ask for a room with a window seat for a great view of the city ! I enjoyed sitting and watching the city activity below me . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m never disappointed with the service at a So ##fit ##el , and this time was no exception . What a magnificent stay . Quiet , clean , well appointed rooms and the service is outstanding . We were upgraded to the Presidential Suite ( at a cost , of course ) and sipped champagne overlooking the Chicago sky ##line . It may have been one of the nice ##st rooms I ' ve ever stayed in - and I ' ve stayed in some of the world ' s most famous hotels . Thank you So ##fit ##el . A shout out to Ely ##dia , who arranged everything and made it an amazing vacation . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We brought family together from several states and everyone was more than pleased with not only this facility but also this venue ! Beautiful hotel with amazing amenities ! Our group was diverse in age and entertainment requests ! Some went to the theater ( Phantom of the Opera ) , others shop ##ped , while others still took the children to Navy Pier ! The perfect combination ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The quality of food and accommodation ##s , clean ##liness of the room , pro ##mpt ##ness of the service , friend ##liness of the staff , and location of the hotel was fantastic . Our stay at the O ##m ##ni greatly contributed to our overall experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I will S ##O stay here again ! Located right in the heart of everything , beautiful rooms and so much history ! We heard they had history tours but due to CO ##VI ##D were not currently giving them during our stay . We did however venture around on our own and were blown away by the different locations ! I only wish we could have seen some of the ballroom ##s , I ' m sure they were just as amazing ! Great views from the lounge on the 32 ( ? ) floor and from our room ( little bit of the river and the lake ! ) . The best part of our whole experience though was the bell ##man , Will ! From the moment we arrived he went above and beyond . . . they seriously have a g ##em of an employee in him and we cannot say enough good things about him ! High ##ly recommend this place , and say hi to Will for me ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this property through Hot ##wire and were pleased with the result . This is close to public transit , and walk ##able to many key attractions , like Millennium Park . I loved the d ##é ##cor of this hotel - art de ##co and a little g ##lam . Very cool ! The staff was court ##eous and helpful , from the bell ##man to the front desk . As some others have said , the rooms were on the smaller side . With a great city at your feet , you won ' t be spending much time in the room . Although we were located right across from the elevators , our room was comfortable , with minimal hallway noise . The biggest complaint I have is that the w ##if ##i was pretty c ##rum ##my . My husband couldn ' t connect at all , and I had better connectivity without it . This would have been an issue for me , had I needed to get any work done . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have visited this hotel in January the last two years and had a great experience both times . The rooms are nice , the service is great , and you can ' t beat the location . We will definitely stay at this property again . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was so excited about staying here because I love the Kim ##pton brand . But my room at the All ##egro was very disappointing . The hallway ##s are dark and de ##pressing . The room was small , but the bathroom is S ##O S ##O S ##O small with barely any space to even stand at the sink . It was very dark and did not feel clean , spacious or comfortable . The worst part was the paper thin walls . My head ##board and my neighbor ' s head ##board were separated only by this thin wall , and I had to endure an entire night of their bedroom sounds . They were not being super - loud , but there was no way not to hear everything . In the morning I could hear every word of their phone conversation , which was at a normal volume . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My colleagues and I participated in the free hotel tour by the con ##cier ##ge . It ’ s a beautiful building ; T ##iara was very friendly and know ##led ##gable . 5 * s for the guide ! We just wanted to give our thanks to her . It ’ s s ##hr ##oud ##ed in history and stories . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay at the fair ##mont Chicago on a regular basis and the staff at the gold club is phenomena ##l . Cody , Tiffany and most especially , Man ##dan ##a are extremely at ##ten ##tive . It ’ s like home away from home but better ! ! I high , y recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] After the stay this hotel became my first choice in Chicago . The hotel staff are all very professional , polite , helpful and thoughtful . My whole family including my wife and all my kids are very happy during the stay . I stayed in the 17th floor this time , and the room is very quiet , extremely clean into every detail , also with all the needed amenities . Finally the location is un ##beat ##able : right on the Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile and it ' s so easy to go anywhere from this location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great views and very clean ! ! ! The only thing that would make this hotel better is a refrigerator and microwave in the room , because the hotel is near some wonderful places to eat and having a way to keep left ##overs would have been helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recent stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was a very positive experience . The breakfast and happy hour were perfect . The staff including Dan at the front desk were very helpful especially in setting up an U ##ber account . The rooms were spacious and comfortable . The location is near great shopping and restaurants . The value is excellent . Will definitely return and would advise others to consider this fine hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ok , but getting a little tired . Room ##s were good sized but the noise from the adjoining room was un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly in ##tr ##usive . Nice river and lake views . The club level was a zoo in the mornings . The staff was great , but the s ##warm ##ing guests made it an unpleasant experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ m leaving a 5 star as the hotel In General deserves it . The food and beverage department need to step it up in their level of service . D ##wayne is outstanding and is the reason we keep coming back . We look forward to seeing him and he just rocks . We stay here every year and he is just a special person ! Take care of that man and is smile . [SEP]
0	[CLS] While staying at the Chicago So ##fit ##el , I had excellent service , a clean and comfortable room , and was close to the heart of the action ! I will definitely be staying here again in the future . Thanks so much for a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was a great find for a last minute vacation to Chicago - they are really affordable considering how many amenities you receive and how beautiful the hotel is . It is very hips ##ter - ch ##ic . The best part of the stay was the breakfast on every floor - they had all sorts of baked goods , yo ##gu ##rt , o ##at ##me ##al , tea , coffee - it was great ! The rooms are pretty large , too , for just two people . The only con ##s were that our view wasn ' t very good ( we were on the east side of the building and looked out onto another building ) and that the room service is just take out from Harry Cara ##y ' s across the street . It was a full menu , but over ##p ##rice ##d , and we just ordered our own take ##out from there so we didn ' t have to pay the premium ##s on the room service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our new favorite hotel around the River ##walk . After a horrible experience at the London ##H ##ouse , we are so glad that we made alternative arrangements at the Swiss ##ote ##l . The staff couldn ' t have been more welcoming and the rooms were lovely with stunning views of the river . High ##ly recommended ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I very much enjoyed my stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . From the " informal " lobby full of friendly staff to the generous rooms with lots of natural light , this hotel offers a great atmosphere . The continental breakfast and cocktail hour were much better than what is offered in more standard " chain " hotels . The location was convenient to meetings I had in the Loop , even walk ##able in some cases . I highly recommend this option and will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed here several times and never been disappointed . The rooms are spacious with high ceilings and breakfast is served on every floor . You can walk out in your robe and get breakfast ! Happy Hour starts at 5 and includes a wonderful array of app ##eti ##zers including anti ##pas ##ti , cheese , vegetables and hum ##mus . One drink per person per night is free . We were able to walk everywhere from the theatre district to Navy Pier to Michigan Ave . It is located in the River North section and we were able to walk to the River ##W ##alk in the morning to exercise . Staff is very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were 2 blocks from the lake and 1 block from the theatre . The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mike was an easy walk ! Love ##d the grand ##eur of this historic landmark . Room ##s were spacious , 2 bathroom ##s ! ! ! Will definite stay here when I visit the Wind ##y City again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an excellent hotel located in the heart of Chicago . You can walk to most locations or take the hop on hop off tours from She ##rato ##n stop . Hotel definitely needs renovation but it is maintained very well . Meeting halls are huge and convenient [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel to stay in . Close to The Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile , river , and much more . Updated property , rooms extremely nice , amenities great ( happy hour with Robert very nice ) , breakfast on each floor , and the staff super nice and helpful ! Absolutely would stay here again and recommend it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel - fantastic staff . Would definitely stay at this hotel again . Close to Lincoln Park and Lakes ##hore Drive . Also , within walking distance of Rush & Division , Michigan and the restaurants and bars and shops . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only thing I found lacking , was the towels . Even though we had 2 people in the room , several days they only left 1 wash ##cloth . It was obvious that both beds had been slept in , so why only 1 wash cloth , and sometimes only 1 small towel . The house ##keeping staff was very polite , saying they didn ' t have enough clean ones . Usually they brought the replacement ##s fairly soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I phone ##d 2 to 3 weeks in advance to request a lower floor room ( can ' t ride elevators ) only to learn when I arrived they were doing renovations from 3 - 8 putting me on 8 . No one knew ? Made a phone call ( $ 1 . 50 ) downstairs requesting a fork ( $ 8 . 00 ) . Stay ##ed 4 nights , house keeping for only 2 . Room ##s were paid in advance . Instead of researching all I received was an argument when checking in . In ##sist ##ing I pay with a credit card . My boss received the same treatment . Room ##s were a good size and bathroom ##s were large . Door men were wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just finished 3 day stay at this wonderful hotel . When we checked in and out , we were greeted , helped , and welcomed by an amazing gentleman named Timothy . He went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of in all ways possible and I just wanted to take this time to thank Timothy for doing such an excellent job ! Thank you She ##rato ##n Grand and Timothy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly quiet room . Spot ##less cleaning . Central location and Great restaurants nearby . Especially Joe ’ s Sea ##food prime steak and C ##rab . All the staff were very helpful and friendly . Will definitely stay at Ki ##nz ##ies hotel next time I visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we got to our room , we discovered that we didn ' t have any extra bed ##ding for the sofa bed for the kids . We called downstairs and asked them to bring some up . We left for dinner , and when we came back the sofa bed was all made up for us . Great service . We also ate breakfast in the Millennium Room . I wouldn ' t personally recommend the b ##uff ##et , but we did have a nice breakfast one morning by ordering off the menu . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall very good . Fantastic location in downtown . Within walking distance to everything including the River ##walk . Always able to get a cab immediately if needed . Custom ##er service / staff was helpful and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent place to stay . Very cool rooftop bar and lobby on 20th floor . Great views all around & close to Michigan Ave & restaurants . The electronic room light controls & blind ##s are fun and modern . Fu ##rn ##ishing ##s are sleek and interesting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I lived in Chicago many years ago . Public ( the old Ambassador East ) was a very ch ##ic / hip / elegant " Gold Coast " hotel with one of " the " spots in Town - The P ##ump Room . Well , modern ##ized a bit , but still has a worn look in spots , this hotel has large and well appointed rooms , two bars ( pump room ) with a very good v ##ibe . I knew the neighborhood and it has not changed . Beautiful , quiet and safe with Division St a short 2 block walk with all its pubs and restaurants . Small c ##laus ##tro ##phobic gym , Jean George restaurant , lots of seating , space for a coffee , drinks , meetings or hanging out with friends . En ##joy ##ed my stay and would not hesitate to go back unless they got silly with prices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed only for 2 nights but I really like this bout ##ique hotel . Location is great ( no view ) everything is close by . The breakfast is funny to serve yourself . I need to mention that Jason ( I hope I got the name correctly ) at the front desk was really kind and helpful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel on the river , downtown with beautiful lake views . Room was large , bed was comfortable , staff friendly and helpful . The Palm restaurant in the lobby an excellent choice for a great steak . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed my stay at Kim ##pton Monaco . The room was clean and spacious and the river view was worth the price . The window seating is better than I expected and one of the highlights of our room . I have a few small details to complain about but they will not change my 5 star rating . During social hour , wine glasses were still in the plastic dish ##wash ##er glass holder rather than set out dried and spot ##less . Our floor had an old ugly vacuum cleaner outside of the elevator most of the day . Like I mentioned , small simple observations but overall a great place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A + all around . Location , Staff , Lo ##bby , Room , Bath ##room . And if you get a good price - all the better . Bed was super comfortable , great for watching large flat screen TV . Love ##d the separate bath ##tub and large shower ' stall ' . And room 71 ##7 has good view and quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really liked the hotel . great rooms , great de ##cor , staff is friendly . great rest ##au ##rent downstairs adjacent to the Hotel for breakfast . Same thing for the rest ##au ##rent , great de ##cor , staff is nice and helpful . My only negative , I was walking from about a mile where I had dinner with customers . Pass ##ed in front of it a few times looking for the Kim ##pton hotel . It doesn ' t say Kim ##pton hotel at the front . weird ! ! I guess they just joined . . not sure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had a great stay at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago . Te ##rik B was a great help ! He made things a lot easier for me which made my stay here even better . I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family if they are ever in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Des ##per ##ately needs renovation and a good cleaning . Stay ##ed two nights over Memorial Day Weekend . and the room smelled must ##y . The bathroom floor was some of the dirt ##iest tile I ' ve seen in a hotel in addition to the bathroom door being rot ##ted from water damage . Although the hotel is historic and charming , I did not find the sore throat and nasal congestion after my first night charming . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we arrived , we were treated kindly and professionally . Staff was genuine and welcoming . Room de ##cor was a twist on modern , very comfortable beds and pillows , , quiet and with high end features . Great location to restaurants and shopping on Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . En ##joy ##ed their on - site restaurant for a charming and ta ##sty f ##rench inspired breakfast menu . It truly couldn ' t have been any better It was the perfect choice for our Anniversary . Book ##ed through Travel ##Z ##oo so pricing was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stop searching for a Chicago hotel online - stay here ! A fantastic experience . The location , staff and facilities are perfect . Aid ##a was my check - in re ##p and was so nice . So ##fit ##el is a European - based group of ups ##cale hotels . Besides Chicago , I previously stayed with them in NYC , Paris , Berlin , Rome Munich and Venice . This hotel was top - notch ! Book a newly - refurbished room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent check in process . We ##l ##coming staff . E ##ase of transport . Location , location , location ! Beautiful room . G ##IA ##NT bed ! The hotel is in a different building from the last time I stayed . . . didn ' t know how it would compare , but easily as good ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at dozens of hotels in Chicago . Home ##wood Suite ##s is the best hotel for services and amenities . From the compliment ##ary breakfast through the evening social , the atmosphere is outstanding . The staff treat every customer as if they are the only customer . Overall , a wonderful experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##abulous a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s , comfortable , and relaxing . Excellent service . The room was updated , modern , with a 65 inch flat screen TV . Spa like bathroom . Sleeping was a dream on the very comfortable bed . A great option when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand is a fairly typical She ##rato ##n " convention style " hotel . Lots of rooms , a large lobby and bar to accommodate the large number of guests . The rooms were spacious and clean and the rooms overlooking the river offered a very scenic view . Service was average and it was not over ##p ##rice ##d . The con ##cier ##ge service was also just adequate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t know where to start . They forgot to do my bedroom one night . You have to pay 5 dollars for the gym . 3 dollars per luggage if you want to store them when checking out . So old and dusty and it s ##tin ##ks of past smoke . De ##fo to avoid it . Sad rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed 2 nights . Were in Chicago for a get away weekend . Staff was outstanding . We ate in their restaurant for breakfast and was pleasant ##ly surprised at the quality and selection . Our room was a Standard King non smoking . Perfect for our visit . Not large but very well done and clean . Bed was comfortable and had good pillows . On premises parking was a bit price ##y but worth the convenience . Nor ##f ##h end of Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was a great size , the bedroom with double beds closed off from the living area . We traveled with my mom and two children and it was plenty of room . They loved the pool and convenient access to everything . 5 stars ! Medina ( our floor hostess ) and the house ##keeping and bell staff were amazing . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago provided the high quality experience I was seeking in the perfect location from which to conduct business and then venture out to see the local sights . I would highly recommend this hotel and its amenities to anyone looking to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I surprised my daughter for her birthday with a trip to Chicago and another stay at Hotel Monaco ! . . . the treats and liquid l ##iba ##tions were f ##abulous !

We will be back ! . . . can ’ t wait to see the restaurant renovation too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very good , well - run hotel . Last week , my wife and I found four staff to be exceptional in terms of positive energy and professional ##ism : Moe - the morning waiter ( 6 : 15 am ) Henry - bell stand Tory - bell stand Eddie - hail ##ing and meeting taxi ##s For business , I travel a lot especially throughout the USA . I ' ve stayed at half a dozen other Chicago hotels in the Loop . These four were consistently amazing in their authentic positive energy and competence . Any hotel in the world would be lucky to have them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent property in close proximity to many ' to do ' things in Chicago - good ' walk - ability ' factor , good restaurants , 2 blocks from the Hancock building , a few blocks from the subway for access to W ##rig ##ley or west loop , e ##z walk to the rivers . Friendly , professional staff , enjoyed the stay and felt very welcomed . Check ##ed - in early very easily , even offered to change rooms if we didn ' t like it after a few hours . Excellent space with small living area separate from bedroom , felt like a mini apartment rather than a hotel room . Perfect spot for us - - [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Shop ##s and restaurants a ##ple ##nt ##y . Hotel is vintage but not s ##hab ##by . Sound ins ##ulation is the only con as you can hear everything crystal clear from closing doors , to people using the bathroom . Outside street noise can also be quite loud if you ' re a light sleep ##er . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our first visit to Chicago . . . I requested " if possible " a higher floor with a city view - the hotel did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! Our room was on the 31st floor ( top floor is 32nd ) with great views overlooking the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My daughter , grand daughter and I stayed in this hotel for four days and were thrilled with the service we received . The hotel was close to so many places we wanted to visit , the young guy that whistle ##s for the cab ##s was very helpful and polite . The food breakfast and afternoon meal was different each day and had something for everyone ! The servers went out of their way to accommodate us ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago is in a great location , directly across from Grant Park and a short walk to Lake MI ##chi ##gan and most of the downtown attractions . The hotel is very nice . The Lo ##bby is beautiful . The rooms are spacious and the 2 bath rooms are wonderful . The staff was very helpful . The one negative is they made us pay $ 3 . 00 to store our luggage when we checked out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked online a few weeks in advance because we required a specific room type . We arrived and were given a room with one king bed . That wouldn ' t work for our family of 4 . We called the front desk and they moved us to a larger room . Still not the room we had booked a month before . Our new room left my husband and I sleeping on the world ' s most uncomfortable Murphy Bed . It was the pits . We en ##quire ##d about our original booking and was told they were out of that room for the night . 3 nights later my entire body hurt . After a long day of walking a comfortable bed and pillows are a must . We have never stayed at this hotel before and probably won ' t stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Chicago Conrad is stunning . Every detail of the de ##cor , the rooms , and the staff - perfection . Take special note of the best beds and bed ##ding I ' ve experienced to date , and the " marsh ##mal ##low " robes ! Un ##real . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night , and we wished we were there longer ! Love the small sitting area separated from the bedroom . It was a really well kept and clean room with lovely views and windows that partially opened to let a nice breeze in . Would definitely stay here again . The only slight issue we had is that I had booked two rooms and initially , they were only showing one room on my reservation , however it turned out they booked the second room with a miss ##pelling in my last name . They found the error and it was never an issue , just a slight scare when checking in . We also booked through Hot ##wire . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The customer service at this hotel is non exist ##ent . If you ask for anything the answer is no . It used to be my hotel when I would travel to Chicago . Just stayed there in July , but after this stay I will never stay here again . I was charged 3 ##x what I should have been and the front desk staff couldn ’ t even see that I pre ##pa ##id for a late check out as I came for the Chicago marathon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed 1 night for a conference . The room air ##con and fan did not work and I had to call up the mechanic at 11 . 30 ##pm to fix it . It still did not work . The rooms are updated , but the air ##con is ancient . I asked to be in a quiet area as I had to get up early for work and instead was placed next to a room of very loud guests that came in and out of their room until 2 ##am . If my fan had been working , I may not have been able to hear the noise . I am a small person and I found the shower to be tiny . Would not recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The rooms and bathroom ##s were very nice . the bed was comfortable and the service was incredibly friendly and welcoming . The room service was genuinely wonderful and I wouldn ' t hesitate to stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were looking to replace one of our go - to hotels that is no more ( The James ) . There are so many choices downtown and it ' s hard to make a decision . We have a 5 - year - old so we wanted to go some ##place central to downtown , has a pool , and had a larger room , the O ##m ##ni checked all these boxes . The O ##m ##ni Chicago Hotel is in the perfect location right off Michigan Ave across from Disney Store ( Just for reference , but also a plus ) . The staff at the O ##m ##ni is really what sets it apart , everyone was so nice . The door ##man / v ##alet staff where all the best I have ever dealt with , Mar ##ham s ##pi ##fic ##ially was so ##oo ##o great . Our Room was large and clean . We will be coming back to the O ##m ##ni for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago for a business trip . The staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The best thing about the hotel is its location , which is just a couple of blocks from Michigan Ave . and the Navy Pier . My only complaint is the mini - bar in the room . The ex ##or ##bit ##ant prices for the drinks and snack ##s are insulting ( especially when you can get the same things much cheaper very close to , if not at , the hotel ) . I can ' t believe this ( or any ) hotel still has mini - bars in the rooms . Instead , it should have refrigerator ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , we walked to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Mill ##eni ##um Park , and Navy Pier all in one day . Great staff friend ##liness and absolutely beautiful , new hotel . Great interior design and atmosphere . En ##joy ##ed br ##unch in the restaurant Baptiste and Bo ##ttle as well . Would highly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in Chicago for a large trade show , so rooms were tight . This She ##rato ##n was very good . Clean and modern rooms . Everything in working order . Good breakfast . The Shu ##la steak ##house was ok - - good service but me ##dio ##cre food , and expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Despite rainy and cool weather during my stay walking into the Talbot ##t is like coming home . Staff are warm and friendly , rooms are home ##y and warm feeling , food is always great . I love the location because you can walk everywhere to great shopping and restaurants as well as public trans and the lake ##front . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel had everything I though it would and met all the expectations you would expect of a hotel just off the miracle mile and opposite The Drake . All the staff where helpful and the rooms clean and well appointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Park ##ing will cost an additional $ 71 . The sign is in the front of building partially hidden by a tree plant ##er . I didn ’ t see any sign in the v ##alet parking area . Although convenient it was quite a he ##fty price ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am here for a tour with my friends though I was solo in one room . The hotel is great , the suit is very good for having a party or family stay . The room is quite and big . The staff there is nice and helpful . They make me feel at home . De ##fin ##ite ##ly Re ##com ##men ##d ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Grant ##ed , few hotels can handle conventions of 900 people . But when they " upgrade " you to a different room saying there is a view of the Lake we didn ' t think they meant we had to lean out of the window and use bin ##oc ##ular ##s . The room had two bathroom ##s - nice for two women traveling together . But one was only partially stock ##ed with towels , hair dry ##er etc . Coffee service wasn ' t fully stock ##ed . W ##i ##F ##i didn ' t work well . Room cleaning didn ' t happen until late in the afternoon . All in all , not a great experience for $ 225 plus taxes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location Breakfast included which is a r ##arity in Chicago . Late afternoon cocktail offer . Staff very helpful and at ##ten ##tive . After 20 years of travel to Chicago , probably the best price / quality ratio found to date [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay at this hotel was really comfortable . The view was amazing . Initially my room did not have a view . So we ended up buying an 25 $ / per day upgrade to higher floor and Lake view . That room was amazing . Great mornings . Room ##s were clean and beautiful . Hotel had a great lobby to hang around . A few shops to buys some stuff . Location is perfect . Walking distance to many attractions and 1 - 2 miles away from rest of the attractions . Save ##s a lot of money as you don ' t need to rent car . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Best location and hotel for the price . I love staying here because I love this location , but it is also a great historic hotel , with updated rooms that are decent sized , and some of them even bigger ! I have stayed in many downtown Chicago hotels and this is the best location and room for the price ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quick trip to the city and this hotel is the perfect location for visiting the River Walk , shopping and great restaurants . Room was super com ##fy and had all the amenities needed for a hotel stay . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed here during the Chicago St . Patrick ' s Day celebration , and it was P ##ER ##F ##EC ##T . The room was clean and comfortable , and the view was spectacular . It was a cold weekend , so we appreciated being about to walk downstairs and directly out to the river to see it being dye ##d green . You really can ' t ask for a better location downtown . U ##BE ##R and L ##y ##ft were reasonable fare ##s to get around , but if the weather is nice , you can walk easily to so ##uve ##nir shops , popular landmarks , restaurants , and bars . We upgraded to the Club level , which was more than worth the investment . The staff there was at ##ten ##tive , friendly , and welcoming . You really felt as if you were being invited into their personal homes for a meal . The Club food was ta ##sty and varied . Really can ' t speak highly enough for this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was at the hotel for business and leisure . The staff at the front desk , con ##cier ##ge , sales and banquet department offered stellar hospitality services . The rooms are spacious and comfortable . I had an enjoyable experience overall . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My first choice every time I am in Chicago is to stay at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile Hotel ! It is a beautiful property right in the heart of River North on Michigan Avenue near all the shops , restaurants , bars , clubs and a short walk to the Chicago River and Lake Michigan . The hotel has numerous amenities and perhaps the best hotel work ##out facility I have seen including a beautiful indoor lap pool . And is the case with all Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Hotels , the service is second to none the moment you step on the sidewalk outside the hotel . The hotel is excellent for those on business as well as those enjoying a personal stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thus is a wonderful property in a great location . I highly recommend the Conrad and would stay there again in the future . From the moment of arrival until you leave it is a great experience . The staff are wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Caroline Sanders and Corey Rice and Emerson F ##lo ##hr and Matt Garcia are all so ##oo persona ##ble and helpful ! We loved loved loved being helped by all of them and felt so at home . Especially since they all work on night shifts . We needed extra help with our two little ones ( two kids under 2 ) and they all were so helpful with extra care ! And the restaurant is excellent as well ! Thank you Kim ##pton Chicago ! ! We would love to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 2 nights and all of us were on the same floor . Nice lounge area and rest ##rooms on main floor . Restaurant serving breakfast convenient and very friendly staff . Good choices but way too large portions and rather price ##y . Our room was clean and quite comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great shopping location ! Excellent staff , breakfast , happy hour and next to the R ##ED Line . Nord ##strom across the street , Bloom ##ing ##dale ##s 1 mile away - Eat ##aly is an Italian Super ##S ##tore and Restaurant Pi ##zz ##eria 1 / 4 walk G ##RE ##AT location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 2 days as my original hotel was so terrible . This Hotel was great and the reception staff was excellent and helpful . The room was comfortable and the bathroom was clean . Nice view of the river . W ##if ##i was good . The only problem I encountered was with the house ##keeping as the one who was going to clean the room wanted to clean the room right away but we were still getting ready . . . Very imp ##oli ##te ! ! ! Otherwise , stay was great and would still recommend this Hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed numerous times , solid hotel with great location and an amazing restaurant / room service . Older building so sound quality can sometimes be challenging ( outside construction etc ) great staff - only issue is the lame work ##out facility , go run along the lake as al ##t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Need ##ed an extra day to stay for Cubs World Series . Very a ##cco ##mada ##ting . Excellent location . Would recommend this hotel . Nice room for two people . Over night parking was steep but plenty of parking garage ##s to choose from [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was extremely disappointing in every way . Uncle ##an room , bed crooked by 10 inches diagonal ##ly , coffee con ##di ##ments not re ##fill ##ed , sheets not changed between guests , toilet ##ries already open , food was dry and not very good . The internet was so slow that it wouldn ' t load pages or download my email . I felt like I was at a Holiday Inn , I just pay ##ed a huge premium for everything here . Actually , I ' ve had better rooms and meals at Holiday Inn . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So central ##ly located , so many things within walking distance ! Every single staff member was welcoming and cheer ##y . I was here for a small conference - small by Chicago standards , only 1000 people - - but everything was smooth , from check in , to our coordinated meals . They had staff ( thankful ##ly ! ) to guide us to our session rooms , It may lack the ' charm ' of smaller bout ##ique hotels , but the service is outstanding . I highly recommend visiting De ##b and Juan in the lounge in St ##ets ##on ' s . I walked in a travel ##er but walked out a friend . I ' ll be back , if only to eat there again and experience their hospitality ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are into hotels on the Historic list with amazing lo ##bb ##ies , a great lobby bar , excellent staff , and amazing architecture this is the place for you . Besides the fact that Chicago is an excellent city . You could easily spend a week there having fun . Seriously , you can get a room at a decent price , everything else is expensive but there is also plenty of options close by . They don ’ t need my review to reinforce the great ##ness of this place . Check out the Drake also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at Hotel Monaco on numerous visits to Chicago . The staff are great , even arranging for my coat to be sent up to my hotel in Milwaukee free of charge when I left in Chicago . The rooms are spacious and comfortable , free wine in an evening and a great restaurant for breakfast . Central ##ly located and within walking distance of all downtown attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . We walked to most places . Andrea and Jo ##J ##o at the check in desk were great . They were very helpful in getting to the location via CT ##A and very helpful in finding things in the area . P ##ric ##illa in dining made sure we had what we needed for our diet ##ary restrictions . The gentlemen handling v ##alet parking were very friendly and polite . Great trip . We will be back soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , staff and rooms . Stay here often for business and it is consistently good . . On ##site restaurant is good plus there are other good ones nearby . T ##ip : 24 hour C ##VS across the street comes in handy for forgotten items or snack ##s / water . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic bout ##ique hotel ! We stayed here for 2 nights in September on a work / pleasure trip . A ##wes ##ome location ! Wonderful staff ! Everyone at the hotel Monaco was persona ##ble and friendly and went above and beyond when we asked for anything . Would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone asking for places I suggest to stay ! And the location was spectacular ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location was good even though it was 1 / 2 hour walk to the river . Room ##s were comfortable and we had two bat ##bro ##oms for an extra fee which was convenient for 4 adults . Near the theater and the park . Excellent gym ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel was very average . With all the choices of hotels in Chicago , I would recommend you stay somewhere other than this hotel for your money . Experience was not bad but not great either . Just an average place to stay so if you are looking for a great experience , this is not the hotel for that . However , the location is good . It is very close to many restaurants and activities in the downtown area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the second time we have stayed doing the New Years weekend and the staff is friendly but the rooms are average . The hand ##ica ##p shower ##s are terrible . It is our belief that these type rooms should be used for the pp ##l who are hand ##ica ##p . The water from shower could not be contained to shower area which poses a trip hazard . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came for a conference . I ##mp ##ressed by staff at ##ten ##tive ##ness and friend ##liness . Bed ##s and linen ##s were AM ##A ##Z ##ING - super soft ! A ##wes ##ome view from the fitness center . En ##joy ##ed the smooth ##ies that were available following my run . Great view of the Chicago River and the lake from my room . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was colder than I had hoped but was still a good time . Our hotel was so comfortable that we didn ' t mind spending more time in our room than we normally would have . We ate breakfast 4 different mornings and I had something different each time and each time I really enjoyed it . We found many things easily walk ##able even in the cold ! I almost forgot to mention the pillows were fantastic ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] For our first trip to Chicago , we wanted to stay walking distance from key highlights and near the subway for other places . And it was perfect . Walking to breakfast ( we never ate in hotel cafe , but we grabbed soda ##s there once ) and late night b ##urger ##s , walking distance to Hancock b ##ld ##g and the water tower district . We attended a service at Holy Name Cathedral . And it ' s three blocks off the Red Line subway , so W ##rig ##ley field was a quick ride away . We loved the antique charm of the hotel - great details like crown mold ##ing and co ##ffer ##ed ceilings , great furniture . The staff were all really great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was great . It ’ s close to the lake and close to great restaurants and shopping . On the down ##side , the v ##alet was $ 67 / day or you can self park half a block away for $ 45 . The hotel looks great for an old building . We booked 2 rooms and they gave us adjoining rooms which worked out pretty well for us . The bathroom ##s were small but decent and the rooms were a good size . The beds were com ##fy . In our room , the side table lamp keeps going on & off late at night without anyone turning it on . I say ghosts but hub ##by thinks it ’ s an electrical short . Either way would be scary lo ##l [UNK] [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love this hotel . Its amazing ##ly wonderful to stay here . The room was p ##rist ##ine , and the staff was incredibly at ##ten ##tive . I definitely look forward to coming back here every month I take a business trip to Chicago . Its central location to the best fine dining restaurants , The v ##alet are friendly , service oriented and truly makes you feel at home . The staff of this hotel are reliable from room service , to house ##keeping needs and the reservation staff acknowledge your presence when you are back visiting the hotel . Its a five star hotel at a great price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] K ##wan ##e one of the reception staff was excellent , a very warm welcome and nothing too much trouble . . . . the hotel is situated in the middle of shops though most " high end " walking distance to most sites and attractions . The metro to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very spacious and room ##y for my week of business travel . The basic w ##if ##i was speed ##y enough to allow me to get my work done . 67 ##6 was a plus ! Great service and delicious cocktail ##s in a relaxing environment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] D ##wayne is incredible and will make your stay perfect ! He took care of our luggage , it when our room was not perfect he moved us to another room . Every ##time we turned around he was helping someone . He just appears out of no where whenever someone needs something as small as a chair . Great Man ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is extremely nice , very clean and super friendly staff . Our room was small but very nice , refrigerator in the room is always an added bonus . The pool , hot tub ##s and gym are clean and well maintained . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this hotel for 5 days whilst in Chicago . Great location next to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Clean rooms with coffee making facilities . Friendly staff and we were very kindly given a late check out when we requested it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel location is good and convenient for shopping , it ’ s close to Millennium Park , and those business districts . The hotel rooms are spacious , but a bit out ##dated . The parking is very expensive . The restaurant is so recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the location of this hotel . You can walk to everything you would want to do downtown . The Big Bar is wonderful . The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable . The only down ##side is the amount of time it takes to get your car after you check out ( just over an hour ) . But , if you are there when there are no large events you will probably be fine . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Chicago is an amazing city . I chose a hotel in walking distance to all the the tourist attractions . The service and friendly staff made my stay memorable . There are many restaurants and cafe ##s near by , al ##I at very reasonable prices . . I will visit again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##ruly enjoyed the hotel and especially the Club Lounge . . . Connie and Renee were there to truly make your day ! Mark at the front desk went out of his way with kindness . Great location , comfortable rooms , lovely gym . You won ' t be disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ed to Chicago to attend the Thanksgiving Day parade and stayed the night at The Palmer House . Had an issue with the neighboring room that was beginning to es ##cal ##ate . The hotel staff did a great job to keep the issue from getting out of control . Very happy with how we were treated ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed staying at Home ##wood . Great location , very nice room , and we especially the weekday evening social ##s . Very friendly staff and a variety of good food . We would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This historic building has modern rooms . It would have been nice if the room was more unique or had a great view , but it was comfortable and clean . Everyone working there was very helpful , and Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby made it easy to get a cup of coffee to go in the morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After recently completing a corporate program at the property I wanted to specifically call out the banquet staff for the incredible job they do . From James to C ##J , they responded to all of our needs without hesitation . We look forward to coming back next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was fun walking around this property - very old world . The rooms were fine , small but co ##zy . The location was great for business and also for walking to the river , shopping , etc . En ##joy ##ed my stay there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here with some family this weekend to celebrate my dad ’ s retirement . We arrived to the hotel around 12 : 30 not expecting to check - in so early , and as we assumed , our room wasn ’ t ready . We were told we ’ d get a text when it was ready ( 3 ##pm being check - in time ) . Long story short , we weren ’ t able to check in until after 5 ##pm due to the previous guest ’ s late check out . This was extremely f ##rust ##rating as we had an event to get to at 6 : 30 . The hotel made no effort to compensate us in any way for our in ##con ##ven ##ience which was really unacceptable . The room when we finally got in was nice and our stay was fine , but our initial impression was cloud ##ed by this in ##con ##ven ##ience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A gorgeous lobby but it ends there . Room ##s are good sized but feel cold and institutional versus Modern . Sad ##ly , the hotel rests on la ##ure ##ls of history and service which are its predecessor ' s rather than its own and I ' m left with a sad irony rather than a heart grateful for resurrection and re ##nai ##ssa ##nce . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located hotel for the many walks and runs that Chicago hosts on the lake front throughout the year . The staff was helpful from the reservation process through to the front desk personnel ho checked us in . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First time in Chicago . What a te ##rri ##fic city , made even better with a comfortable room to return to . Quiet , super clean , and the de ##cor is very welcoming . Will return to stay in this chain of hotel in any city that has it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great suites and amenities in the perfect location . The breakfast was nice to have . Staff was friendly . Suite style rooms was the perfect get ##away feel without the high prices . Location to top attract ##ii ##ns in downtown was great for last leg of trip . Staff could have been more inform ##ative during stay and it would have been nice to have more then one person working the front of house area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago was a great place to stay . The location was very convenient . The whole experience from the time we got out of our car was first class . Everyone we met was friendly and helpful . We asked for a room with a nice view and it was wonderful - we had a great room overlooking the river and the city of Chicago . The room was very clean and modern . The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was nice . I could have stayed in the room the whole time enjoying the view . The pool was great . It was a nice size , with lots of windows and a deck overlooking the river . I just can ' t say enough about how wonderful our stay was . Vale ##t parking was very convenient too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for a few nights and this is a well located hotel for staying downtown . The room was nicely updated and very clean . We also had a great view of the park and lake . I would have no problem staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A ##cco ##mp ##ani ##ed my wife who was on a business trip to Chicago . We have stayed here before and always is a pleasure . Their compliment ##ary wine hour is a bit hit with the guests . The person pouring the wine is always generous with his pour ##s . Some light finger foods are also served . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A well restored Art Dec ##o age hotel with modern yet s ##ty ##lish rooms . In spite of the many original design elements , all of it was in good repair or restored to original s ##pec ##s , and there was not a hint of " run down " . We liked it and also had a nice time at the lobby bar . Good drink selection , well crafted cocktail ##s . The bed was comfortable , and the room was quiet , even though it did face the road ( Randolph s ##tr ) . It was a good experience form one end to the other , and the hotel is in walking distance to so many theatres , restaurants , and art - culture venues that a stay is definitely very worth ##while . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was clean and nice design . Pool closed at 9 pm which was early for us . Park ##ing was easy . We could come and go as we pleased with no additional fees . I asked for lake view upgrade and was put it a room facing the lake , but it was back in a cu ##bby hole of the building so the view was blocked from just about everything . Located at the end of Grant Park . So ##rt of at the end of the line of places that you want to visit , so it is a good starting point , but not in the middle of where u want 2 be . The city tour bus had a stop just outside of the hotel which was good . They divide the elevators up between floors 1 - 20 and 21 - the rest which makes the wait for the elevator much better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##abulous hotel - - my favorite in Chicago and even when I ' m in town I always stop by for cocktail ##s - - bar has awesome q ##ua ##int view and is a great atmosphere . . . . crowded and fun - - love the smell upon walking into the hotel - - re ##f ##reshing [SEP]

1	[CLS] My friend and I attended p ##ogo f ##est a couple weeks ago and were very pleased with our stay at your hotel with the exception of the shower head and after pressure condition we had a great stay . perfect location - good pricing - great staff - very pleased Thank you ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I like to stay here if I have business in the downtown loop area . The location is great and there ' s plenty of restaurants and retail within walking distance . I recently had a two day meeting in early August down near East Randolph . The check - in process was quick and efficient and the clerk offered a " Welcome back , " greeting knowing that I ' ve stayed there before . I had a nice and spacious King room with a great view of the Chicago River and the Marina Towers . The bed was comfortable and the w ##if ##i was fine . If I ' m in Chicago and have a choice , I ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] High points The All ##egro hotel is like going back in time . The lobby is beautifully restored art Dec ##o with modern amenities . Fire ##place is wonderful and there are multiple seating areas . Staff is friendly , at ##ten ##tive and efficient . Room ##s are spacious , small bathroom ##s but excellent water pressure in shower . Bed ##s and pillows excellent . Hotel robes are l ##us ##cious . Low point : Virtual ##ly no closet since it is about 6 inches deep and clothes must hang sideways . Extra points Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary b ##ub ##bly in lobby in afternoon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed the hotel . It was in a great location to all the shops and Ma ##g Mile that you could walk to . The staff were super pleasant and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The room was simple and ch ##ic , but I really loved the bathroom as it was very clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton ##s tend to be great hotels with a lot of old world charm . I was initially optimistic with this one as the lobby was very nice . The fact there is also a connected Star ##bu ##cks is also a major plus . On the down ##side , the rooms ( especially the bathroom ) were super tiny . The space I could get over , but the walls were a major problem . The walls are super thin , and you could literally hear the conversation in the next room over . If you want a historic hotel , I prefer the Monaco down the street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed 4 nights in a corner king suite ( K ##ING B ##ED ) 2 room suite Staff were te ##rr ##fi ##ic the house keeping was spot on , Marcus the con ##cier ##ge great guy very helpful ##l , However there were several down ##side ##s to our stay NO Bus ##sin ##ess center , or computer access / or f ##ax other than at the front desk no privacy . Over ##p ##rice ##d room service and just above average quality food Over ##p ##rice ##d in room bar / snack food No compliment ##ary drink of any kind provided on arrival as it was 95 ##f The Show ##er was over the bath which for elder ##ley people is very restrict ##ive the only one of ( 6 ) was roll in type but you get a smaller bed queen size and room size [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great to explore Michigan a ##ve and the magnificent mile . Staff were generally court ##eous If you plan to take a car use a parking app and self - park somewhere in the neighborhood The pool is well maintained . Con ##cier ##ge was always too busy to answer or reply . thank god for the internet to find alternatives . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a top notch hotel in a prime location on Michigan Avenue , within walking distance to many major Chicago attractions . The rooms are all suites , which is great considering being in the main part of the city . I had several meals at the hotel ( breakfast ##s and lunch ) and all of the food was outstanding . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our room looked out over the gardens , Buckingham Fountain , and the gorgeous Lake Michigan . It was very comfortable , clean and modern . We ate at Katie O Shay ##s and had the breakfast b ##uff ##et . Both restaurants were in the hotel and the food was great . El ##rona ##ya greeted us at check in . He was wonderful . The whole experience was beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! Breakfast was free . Was ok , but could ' ve had better quality fruit all 3 days we were there . Room was clean and nicely done . Bath ##room door in 120 ##4 was L ##O ##U ##D and never got fixed despite our request . Overall a good stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend and can ' t recommend this hotel enough . The rooms are new , spacious , and well - appointed . Having a full kitchen was awesome for saving money and storing left ##overs . Ph ##eno ##men ##al location - easy to get anywhere . The only problem we encountered was getting stuck in the elevator ! Apparently , the elevator mechanism ( ? ? ? ) " over ##heat ##ed " , shutting off the mechanism and leaving us stuck in the elevator between floors . Luckily , they managed to bring the elevator down within 20 minutes . It was mildly terrifying ! I hope they ' ve had some serious maintenance done on it . Upon check ##out , I was given 30 , 000 H ##H points without having to ask . I thought that was mostly satisfactory . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great for shopping and eating . There are many good places around hotel . Staff ##s are very friendly , bed and room was really nice and co ##zy . They offered us compliment ##ary waters and tea bags ( it was e ##vian ) enough every day . Also , the window is big so we could enjoy nice city view in our room . Because of the bad weather while I was in Chicago , I had to stay in the room more than expected but I spent satisfactory and comfortable times in hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came for a family get away and had a wonderful time . Location was perfect . Ad ##dress should read on Huron since that is the actual entrance . Kind ##a hard to find . Staff was so kind and helpful . That was the best part of the stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was s ##nob ##by , expensive , and the staff was overly pre ##ten ##ti ##ous . I regret that I have to return to speak at an event in the near future . Oh well , I ' ll give it another chance next month . If it is still the same and my experience wasn ' t a one off last time , there will be no mercy on the next review . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super nice staff . Nice , but rooms . microwave and f ##rig and a safe . . . all very helpful to have these items in the room . the lighting was great and I appreciated the additional reading lamps on the night stand [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro : The hotel room was very nice and the big window with the view is really something unique . Con ##s : There was a ridiculous $ 5 dollar fee for each package delivered to the hotel that they didn ' t tell about it , even after I sent an email asking for the packages policy ( they only answered that they would glad ##ly accept it ) . It was something so small and annoying but it ruined the whole experience . Didn ' t see any effort to make a 10 night - stay customer truly happy and satisfied so he would come a next time . Would not recommend , would not visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was an amazing value with great location and court ##eous staff . . . . we would stay here again in a heartbeat ! Free hot breakfast . Free dinner / happy hour . Outstanding location . . . lots of shopping / food / tourist stuff within walking distance . A pen ##thouse pool with great city views . Great staff . One of the best all around hotels we ' ve stayed in . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here in my last visit to Chicago in Aug 2015 . This is one of the class ##y places in down town . Quite close to the other commercial places , hotel staff was very professional . One of the things I loved about it is it ' s music ! Yes , the music in elevator was very nice ! Morning breakfast of fruits , r ##ais ##ins etc was great and quite filling . Room ##s were nice and clean . Room w ##i - fi was kind of ok and I could take my conference calls using it with minimum problem . Overall a good experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ing at the Hilton Chicago was part of my niece ' s birthday present . Our original city view room had a view of a brick wall . Even though the room itself was lovely , it was de ##pressing and not what I was paying for . I expressed my disappointment and we were moved to a lake view room at no extra charge due to my niece ' s birthday . I was delighted with the service and re ##sp ##ons ##ive ##ness . My only true complaint is the high cost of self parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel with large junior suites . Not inexpensive , but excellent service . The Palm inside the hotel is nice steak ##house , if you do not want to go out . I will recommend it due to great service . Easy walk to Michigan Avenue stores . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Architectural ##ly taste ##ful bout ##ique hotel . Friendly service with comfortable social spaces . Breakfast option as are limited and priced high . The P ##ump Room restaurant was lovely - rich in de ##cor matched with a good food selection . Would not hesitate to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great views , very nice hotel . Everything you would expect from a She ##rato ##n . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds . Only complaint is that I wish the pool was warmer ! And sometimes U ##ber drivers don ' t know how to find it because there ' s an upper and a lower street . Otherwise a fine place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is perfect . It ’ s within a walking distance to Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile . It ’ s close to Michigan Avenue for nice shopping . The hotel room is big . I stayed on floor 35 with a king size bed . The view from my room is beautiful . However , the room needs to be dust on the end table . The i ##P ##od player was dusty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has a great location . However , was surprised that neither parking nor breakfast were complementary . . . G ##ym is modern and located on floor # 43 with excellent view . The hotel provides an excellent con ##cier ##ge service , and Mel Baker is superb ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a recent show at the Hilton . I have to say , I expected more from a landmark Hilton . The food was terrible ! Unfortunately we had to eat at the hotel for 4 days during these meetings . I have been to many of these shows across the US and this one ranks as one of the worst for food . Staff at the hotel were friendly and the rooms were fine but the bathroom lighting was very poor . One thing that I think was just terrible . . . they charge $ 3 per item you need s ##to ##wed during the day ! What ? ! I thought that was a service . Apparently not . I come to Chicago a couple of times a year . I will be thinking twice on staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful place to stay downtown within easy walking distance of Mill ##eni ##um Park , the Art Institute , the L , and lots of shops and restaurants . The room was a bit small but not bad for a downtown hotel , and s ##ty ##lish ##ly decorated . The lounge was inviting and the staff was always cheerful and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just got back from staying at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Hotel . The check in was fast , staff were very friendly . The rooms are small but we were hardly in them . The hotel is older but historic and nice . It ' s right in the shopping district with a beach 2 min ##s away . We would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff is very helpful and friendly , location is near to Rush St & Michigan Ave . ; the room is very clean and all am ##net ##ies are in the room ; the furniture and look of hotel is very very aged and not impressive [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was clean , quiet , no real issues except could use an update . Need some drawer space . . . also need more space on the van ##ity in the bathroom . A mini fridge to store your own water or drink would be good . There was a fridge but for items to purchase only . Would still stay here again . . . great location in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful 5 night stay ! Staff was excellent , room was not overly huge but very clean and modern . Full ##y stock ##ed fridge was a treat ! Restaurant was great and open until late ! Right around the corner from Michigan Ave ; ) Would definitely stay here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was on the third floor on the east wing . View was nothing but the roof for the most part . I was told u have to pay extra for a nice view . Bath ##rooms are nothing special and the lighting is bad . Room ##s have no fridge unless you want to pay extra . The bell ##hop gave my bag to someone else and it doesn ##t look like I am going to get it back either . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel in a great location . The staff was very friendly and helpful . The restaurant is very nice with a great atmosphere and the rooms are very spacious , updated and clean . I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in this area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here with a group for a volleyball tournament . A great value for Chicago ! Lots of amenities in the suite which was plenty large and comfortable . Odd 6th floor check in but no matter . Nice breakfast . Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our group as we spent a good amount of time in the lobby / breakfast area as a group . Large com ##fy bed squeezed into a small ##ish bedroom but the suite was overall very comfortable . One grip ##e - Bath tub drainage was probably the slow ##est I ’ ve ever experienced . Otherwise really no complaints ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I decided at the last minute to book a hotel room and found The Swiss ##ote ##l . It was such a beautiful stay and what a location ! the work ##out area is amazing . S ##mo ##oth ##ies in the work ##out area where compliment ##ary and the view was phenomena ##l / [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed one night at the Fair ##mont . The staff was wonderful , but they charged us a : surprise $ 20 fee for things w ##3 didn ’ t even know about . ( Spa , W ##i ##F ##i ) : location is average . P ##elin ##g ##wall ##paper in the upgraded room . Coffee cups th ##im ##ble size with nothing to use for a spoon to stir . Finally figured out how to drain the bath ##tub . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent . Am ##bian ##ce and staff are great . Love ##ly amenities and close to magnificent mile . Clean , and has a lovely flu ##ffy carpet to sink your feet into when you ’ ve had a long day on your feet . Local to restaurants , bookstore , shops and red line L train . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were a group of do ##cent ##s from an out of town art museum visiting the Chicago area to visit local art museums and architectural sites . The museum was central ##ly located , convenient , and clean , with an on site restaurant so that we didn ' t need to leave the hotel at the end of a long day if we didn ' t want to . Further , being in the theatre district meant quiet peaceful dining after theatre start times , usually 7 : 30 pm [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bar / restaurant are nice and s ##ty ##lish . The staff is friendly . Location is great . But the rooms are not quite at the bout ##ique level that they claim . Really comfortable bed . NO pay per view , very few channel options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Big and beautiful hotel . Excellent staff , well equipped room for business travel . Am ##eni ##ties were also thought out well . Very good free W ##i ##F ##i . Really easy to use alarm clock . My new favorite in Chicago b [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a long weekend away with some girlfriend ##s . Con ##ven ##ient location to all the wonderful sights of downtown Chicago , yet tucked away enough that you don ' t feel smack da ##b in the middle of a bust ##ling city . The room was clean and spacious enough for three adults . The bathroom was also very clean and room ##y . Bed ##s were com ##fy , pillows p ##lent ##iful . We bought snack ##s / water / wine at W ##al ##green ##s rather than buying what was in the mini ##bar in the room - but it was well - stock ##ed if that ' s your preference . It ' s a lovely property with a warm , historic charm and I ' d definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at all three Kim ##pton ’ s in Chicago and like them all . This location is great if you are going to Cadillac theatre but otherwise business district that isn ’ t very exciting . Room was nice but small . Really liked the lobby look and feel for hanging out in wine hour . De ##fin ##ite ##ly would come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , excellent staff and service , great location , highly recommend ! We had a beautiful view . Lots to do within walking distance . Staff was pleasant and helpful . When traveling to Chicago I will definitely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] When you arrive try and get a higher floor with a view . For the price we were stuck looking at the alley and side of building next door . Until 1 : 30 ##am we endured garbage bin banging then drilling at 7 am on a sun ##day ! . Unless you like this type of " neighborhood am ##bie ##nce " I ' d pick some where else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] booked 2 rooms with the city view with almost 290 per night for each room . And they gave me 21st floor facing another building . Very moderate rooms with average facilities . The door man didn ##t even help my elderly mom to lift her suitcase up in the car . Very disappointed with over all experience . I would not recommend to anyone [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great spot in downtown Chicago with lots of room and access to all the local amenities . Would definitely stay her again , and actually regret not staying at this location my whole trip . Very close local eats ( Eat ##ely , Un ##os , Trade ##r Joe ##s ) , and the room was big enough to accommodate my family of four with room to spare . Breakfast was very delicious and an excellent per ##k , and the staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I used the spot ##her ##o app to park in the garage across the street for $ 10 a night vs the $ 52 rate they have for v ##alet in house . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I understand Co ##vid and all , but with co ##vid on your website should have been a heads up about no fridge . That was my only let ##down , had to throw a way a bunch of food and drinks that were warm because of it [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is beautiful and historic . Was able to go into the famous and historical Empire Room to look around and take pictures . Also went to the 4th floor to see the gorgeous grand ballroom and the other beautiful banquet rooms . Would love to come back for the tour and would love to see the museum . Great loop location . Great attended and clean garage across the street for the self parking . Staff very helpful and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was poor , not helpful & there were many incorrect charges on my bill including $ 300 in v ##alet / parking and I didn ##t have a car - CH ##EC ##K your bill ! There was also movies & a soda on my bill that I never had . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was outstanding , friendly & helpful . The pool was beautiful . My husband had a conference there . The lobby was elegant , but at the same time was warm & inviting . Could use a little more seating in the lobby . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ ll begin this by saying how awesome the hotel is , the room size is perfect if your traveling with a small child or to ##ddler . Their house ##keeping is fast and nice when it came to my daughter proving to be a headache for 2019 ! ! ! I had the pleasure of meeting Ms . Len ##ette and Mr . Eric whom were at ##ten ##tive , knowledge ##able , and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble our entire stay . We also luck ##ed up on some free parking D ##IR ##EC ##TL ##Y 10 steps from the entrance 3 nights in a row during New Years D ##OW ##N TO ##W ##N Chicago that just doesn ’ t happen ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ambassador is te ##rri ##fic . Great hotel and fantastic staff ! B ##re went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and welcome . And I think the bed might be the nice ##st one I ' ve ever slept on in a hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stay in 3 of the Kim ##pton hotels in Chicago and I will have to say that this one is my favorite . Perfect location , great service , and beautiful room ! Though every one of their hotels have a great service and rooms are always clean and com ##fy . But , something special about Hotel Monaco . I think it was the ta ##d bit more space we had in the room . Love the window seats . My one suggestion is to have a few more hooks in the bathroom to hang stuff . The view is f ##abulous and can ' t say enough about the service , from the door ##man to the front desk ! Love the cocktail hour and coffee in the lobby . Plus , the seating in their lo ##bb ##ies are very con ##du ##ci ##ve to conversation and relaxing . Look forward to returning soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed a night the week of Christmas break . The room was nice . We didn ' t spend a lot of time in the hotel as we were busy being a tourist but we enjoyed our time . They have a full compliment ##ary meal and drinks from 5 - 7 and a great compliment ##ary breakfast ! ! Our only complaint is they kept the lobby / dining area at an almost un ##be ##ara ##bly high room temperature . It ' s almost as if they made it that way so one wouldn ' t spend too much time sitting . I would stay again when we come back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love k ##im ##pton hotels . i have always had great experiences with them ! I thought this hotel was an awesome value for what i paid , however , the rooms ( at least the room i got ) was very small . Still , i didn ' t pay much so this was fine . One complaint i did have was that the walls are V ##ER ##Y thin . we could hear people talking , laughing , etc . in the room next to us and the hallway . I was woken up by it several times during the night . I used a white noise app to help drown it out , but it was something that would affect my decision to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I liked the location of this hotel - right in the heart of the City . They charge $ 69 per night for guests to park which I think is WA ##Y too high . Plus $ 75 per night for incident ##als . If you stay for 5 days you will spend $ 720 for parking and incident ##als . Park ##ing and incident ##als costs more than the room . Also my sheets didn ' t smell fresh . The bell ##men and front desk staff were excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here last month and had a wonderful experience . Hotel staff were very friendly . Breakfast available on every floor was very convenient . Hotel provided token ##s for one drink per adult for each day of stay in their bar . This was nice and different from other hotels I ' ve stayed . Hotel location was FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C . Was walking distance to numerous sights . The only thing to remember is that staying in downtown Chicago meant parking was not free . We had to pay a who ##pping $ 64 / night to park our car at the hotel , which was unexpected . It appeared that all hotels were charging the same fee . If you don ' t have to rent a car , better to get an U ##ber / L ##y ##ft to the hotel and use that mode for transportation around Chicago . Overall great experience and would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our four day visit at Swiss ##ote ##l . The rooms are clean and modern . Their gym is the best hotel gym I have ever experienced . It is large , up - to - date , and offers a beautiful view ! The con ##cier ##ge , Mel , was a wonderful help and booked dinner ##s for us . Dinner ##s were always great and we highly recommend chatting with Mel on your visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is lovely . Room ##s are gross . Given the height ##en focus on clean ##liness you would think these rooms would be cleaner . I am a bathroom detective . I first look at the toilet to gauge how clean a room may be . This toilet had urine behind the seat IN THE CR ##AC ##KS . G ##RO ##SS . The chair is nasty , the walls had coffee dripping , the bathroom wall had dropping ##s . And the shower had signs of mild ##ew . I literally went to Target to get spray b ##lea ##ch to clean this room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotels that are walking distance to the W ##ack ##er Drive business district can be ex ##or ##bit ##antly expensive . The Kim ##pton All ##egro has most of the benefits of an ups ##cale business hotel for a much more reasonable price . The location is excellent ; my room was small but comfortable and spot ##lessly clean ; the attached restaurant was expensive but very good for breakfast . There ' s no room service , but otherwise I didn ' t miss any of the amenities of the bigger business chains . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is on an excellent location and walking di ##s ##nta ##nce to all attractions ! Staff are ready to provide excellent service . Will ##i the door ##man is always ready to point you right direction with a smiling face to provide wonderful experiences for everybody . I enjoyed my week long stay at the hotel and whenever I am in Chicago I will stay at this hotel . Thank you for everything . C ##U [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a few days there while running the Chicago Marathon . Staff is professional , pleasant and the rooms are well appointed and clean . The in - hotel restaurant is a little price ##y but the food and service are excellent . Only disappointment is I believe they raised their normal rates due to the marathon being in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here several times and the Fair ##mont never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . This hotel is central ##ly located to the best Chicago has to offer . The rooms are great - large for a hotel . They also have all the nice extra touches that many hotels do not have . . . robes , ne ##sp ##ress ##o machine , toilet ##ries , umbrella ##s . I will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 4 nights to attend a con ##f at M ##x ##D , starting with a nice Father ' s Day dinner at Booth One . You can feel the history in the room , which is comfortable and quiet . They offer a convenient ride to M ##x ##D . Full ##y enjoyable stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great ! Close to all the tourist attractions and clean rooms . The best part is the customer service . Every time we needed help with tracking our u ##ber / l ##y ##ft the gentleman , D ##wayne , working the front , was extremely helpful . He went above and beyond to answer all of our questions of where to go for food , entertainment and finding our way to W ##rig ##ley stadium . I will definitely be booking this place again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this place . Easy walking to all things Chicago with a great neighborhood feel . From the minute we checked in ( after a long day of travel ) we were promptly greeted and given an amazing history overview . El ##vir ##a and Maya went above and beyond to accommodate our small group . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I took our two 1 ##yr old boys to the O ##m ##ni Chicago and immediately all our worries and stresses were put to rest . Everything we had requested ( including 2 c ##ri ##bs ) had arrived to the room upon our arrival . Our check in was so quick and easy . Last ##ly , the entire staff from the v ##alet and con ##cier ##ge to house ##keeping and room service were the nice ##st people we have ever met . This will definitely be our go to hotel for future visits ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided Friday to go to Chicago on Saturday . I have stayed at the She ##rato ##n , the Intercontinental and the Palmer House within the last 18 months . Since this was a spur of the moment trip , we went with a more affordable option . We are pleased with location , staff , and room . Millennium Park , the Pier , & the Mile are accessible by foot . I ##dea ##l location for shopping and eating . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Last weekend a group of 10 of us got 5 rooms here for a girl ' s weekend . The hotel was amazing , the Christmas decorations were beautiful and staff was helpful , friendly and at ##ten ##tive . My room was huge while a friend ' s on another floor was quite small . That wouldn ' t have bothered me as the am ##bie ##nce is more important since we are there to explore the city . My only real complaint was that we couldn ' t all be on the same floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing location easy walking distance to millennium park , restaurants , shopping . Ke ##enan at front desk very helpful in a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting our families needs . Thank you s ##wi ##ss ##hot ##el for making our Chicago trip a great one ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I booked one night at the O ##m ##ni as a surprise celebration for my husband . I couldn ' t have picked a better place to stay ! ! ! L ##O ##VE ##D It ! From the moment we arrived and pulled up to v ##alet to the moment we left , we felt like royalty ! All the staff members that we encountered were so pleasant and so nice ! They really made us feel welcome ! The room was amazing and beautiful and clean ! The bed was so super com ##fy too ! ! When we returned to our room in the evening , we were surprised with a bottle of wine and dessert waiting for us as a con ##gratulations ! We were blown away ! We will definitely be back one day and for certain will highly recommend this wonderful place ! Five stars all the way ! Thanks so much O ##m ##ni for an awesome stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent accommodation ##s , older hotel , but rooms were quite nice . I was upgraded to a suite and also given early check in . Very good stay ! Will stay again as it is also on the river front in the middle of everything ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room overlooking the river was beautiful and our hotel was a short walk to Mill ##eni ##um Park , the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and lots more . It was also within a short walk to bus stops and CT ##A in the loop . W ##if ##i was a little temper ##mental at first but worked well throughout our three day stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were hosting a meeting at the Intercontinental right when all of the news about Co ##rona came out . The staff and management of the Intercontinental were so professional and giving during this stress ##ful time for all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came to stay with someone here on a business trip . Check in had some minor hi ##cc ##ups that the guest services staff handled g ##rac ##iously and professionally . The room was comfortable and clean , we had a lovely view of the river and the city . Our con ##cier ##ge J ##ac ##lyn helped us get parking ( which we knew would be an extra charge ) extended past check out as we had an event . What a total pleasure from start to finish , especially the con ##cier ##ge and parking staff . Thank you J ##ac ##lyn for making the stay extra smooth and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had another wonderful stay at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##g Mile . Fantastic service and great staff . I do need to know what kind of mattress ##es they have - I had the 2 best nights of sleep E ##VE ##R ! This is our go - to place whenever we are in Chicago . Best location and near the Red Line , great shopping and dining . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thank you to Maria for choosing a nice floor for us and being a humble and kind crew , Our room is clean [UNK] We ’ re so comfortable but there ’ s something wrong in the heat ##er it ’ s cold and the foods is so expensive but worth it [SEP]
0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Chicago was perfect for our trip with our 3 year old . The separate room and sitting area was essential ! He loved his kids bag . We had amazing room service , friend staff and the v ##alet staff went above and beyond ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice hotel . It is in the heart of downtown Chicago . It is an older hotel that has been re ##mo ##del ##ed very nicely ! You will be greeted as soon as you pull up . The check in process was sea ##m ##less . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful . if you drive be prepared a he ##fty price to park ( $ 65 a day ) . De ##fin ##ite ##ly an ups ##cale hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great small hotel in the heart of the ma ##g mile district with great beds and close to restaurants and short subway ride from W ##rig ##ley . Nice restaurant & bar on the property . On a side street with quiet access . Easy to hail u ##ber or taxi without crossing massive streets . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My conference was right at the hotel , so I didn ' t really consider any other options , including another Kim ##pton property in the city . For a runner , the location was good , because you ' re in the park in no time . That said , the room was the size of a closet , and my elevated rewards level didn ' t stop them from putting me next to the elevator . Perhaps they could have sip ##hone ##d off some of the space in the lobby for the rooms . ( And yes , the lobby is very nice - but there is a lot of wasted space there . All in all , an under ##w ##hel ##ming experience ( save for the staff , who were typical high quality and helpful ) . I was safe , and I was able to get a good night ' s sleep . So , there ' s that . But , having to work out of my tiny room for two days was brutal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great . There for a large meeting and love that the hotel connects to underground shops with awesome places for grabbing lunch . Many areas in the hotel that were comfortable to hang out while in between sessions . En ##joy ##ed the wine and beer selections in the bar . Love that there is a market open 24 / 7 in the lobby for snack ##s - really helpful when your plane arrives late ! ! Staff all very helpful from check - in to house ##keeping to those directing us to the meeting rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the hotel on business and would also recommend for couples . The O ##m ##ni is at a great location and there are lots of food options nearby . The rooms were beautiful and the staff was pleasant , helpful and inform ##ative when needed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was absolutely perfect . It is a little expensive but my fi ##ance and I had the time of our life . It was our 3 year anniversary and they were so sweet they even gave us compliment ##ary chocolate straw ##berries I would absolutely recommend this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] This had been our favorite hotel in Chicago , but no more . I ' m an ambassador in their system but was not given the guaranteed upgrade . The promised 10 , 000 point compensation was never given . The room had no glass ##ware at all , and certainly no wine glasses - - they did eventually bring them when we asked for them . The room was the worst we ' ve ever had at that hotel , and when we got ready to check out , the original bill was $ 500 more than it should have been . I will probably remain an ambassador in their system but will hence ##forth avoid this hotel . The only decent experience was dining in the Michael Jordan restaurant , which was as good as ever . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Victoria at the front desk made this week ' s visit extra special ! She recognized me from my stay 2 weeks ago and went out of her way to make me feel valued . She was helpful , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for a conference . I have stayed here before since is very convenient to Michigan Avenue and have a nice , modern V ##ibe . Just a couple blocks toward Navy Pier there are grocery stores and several inexpensive restaurants . There is also a nice AMC Theater within a block . Navy Pier is also just a couple blocks away and if you can get a room along the river , it provides a constant nice visual all day . Very nice facility , rooms , restaurants and seating out along the river with a b ##urger place at that level . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great room , polite and court ##eous staff , and everyone goes out of their way to help , even with what is not their job . Al ##en Had ##zi ##c is great - among other things , helps with local travel arrangements . The room was very clean and the towels flu ##ffy and fresh . great view of the river . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location and nice property . Great views from high floors . Friendly staff . Where they fail is foods ##er ##vice . I know it ’ s hard to feed a 1 , 000 + people at an event , but the food has been cold at every meal this week . Plus , the bar is a bit price ##y . The 3 rating ( Average ) is based on comparison to other similar properties downtown . Would we stay here again ? Probably . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We needed a quality hotel , with large modern rooms , close to down town Chicago . This hotel simply exceeded our expectations . Great staff , f ##abulous advice , and a quick walk to Andy ' s Jazz Bar . The room had quality bed ##ding very good shower and bright de ##cor . Access to the city is a short walk , and advice on travel and tourism was freely and accurately provided . When we next stay in Chicago we would stay here again , no question . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited during the cold ##est week in years yet received the warm ##est welcome including a chance to upgrade to Executive Level which included delicious breakfast ##s and afternoon app ##eti ##zers , also a huge room and two bathroom ##s ! Wonderful ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are comfortable , although the furnishings are he ##ctic and a little try hard / overwhelming . Bath ##rooms dated . Location is good , inside the loop . They have elevated the individual staff ’ s attitudes to an inconsistent and ordinary experience . Feel like you ’ re in Star ##bu ##cks . This place needs protocols ! ! ! ! They should learn how to greet , how of offer assistance with baggage , how to offer assistance getting a cab , how to en ##quire if the stay was good . Some staff are so cool and into their own style , it feels like you ’ re interrupting them . It ’ s not expensive ; and if you put up with the above , the value is good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay here every time we come to Chicago . It is convenient to the " L , " the rooms are nice , the staff is fantastic , and the pool is the cool ##est ever . Can ' t go wrong with this great property . We can ' t wait to go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I cannot say enough about the quality of people who I encountered at this hotel during our stay . The front desk people were outstanding . The v ##alet parking people were a little rough in that they wouldn ' t bring your car around ahead of time and you have to go down to the dungeon to get your car . The hotel does need up ##dating . Our shower had been updated but the furniture in the room , the carpet ##ing , etc all seemed a bit old and dated . That being said , this is a great property in a great location with an outstanding staff that should be considered a very good choice for a downtown Chicago hotel option . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My now - husband and I just enjoyed the Royal Suite for 5 days for our wedding and also had a small block of rooms for our guests . Our suite was absolutely incredible ( especially the tub overlooking the city ) and very romantic . We also enjoyed being able to host our guests in the suite for drinks and getting ready with plenty of space . The staff was very friendly and re ##sp ##ons ##ive to the needs of our guests which included access ##ibility and flight cancel ##ation concerns . They also put on a wonderful private br ##unch the morning after our wedding which we all enjoyed very much . A + for comfort and hospitality ; we definitely hope to be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was lovely , clean . Staff was excellent . The Con ##cier ##ge ( s ) were very helpful , knowledge ##able , bar and wait staff professional and quite helpful as well . Custom ##er service and detail oriented . Lo ##bby was very nice and fitness center well stock ##ed and clean . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Super friendly stuff , perfect and super clean rooms and the hotel is located at one of the best spots in Chicago . You can reach shopping miles by walk and also a lot of restaurants are near by . Next time i will define ##tly stay again at the Talbot ##t hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoy staying at the inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal because of location to so many fine restaurants and shopping . Easy walking distance to everywhere . The beds are extremely comfortable and the amenities are very high quality . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Again the O ##m ##ni Chi ##c ##ga ##o super ##sed ##es my expectations for a hotel stay . From check in to check out they always deliver . Oliver our v ##alet was so nice to our kids and the special per ##ks we receive is why we go to the O ##m ##ni about 5 times a year . Thanks again we will be back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont in Chicago is all you would expect from a Fair ##mont . Service is great , rooms are excellent and location is perfect . Great place to stay if you need a downtown hotel . Mill ##eni ##um Park across the street and water views are a real plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed two nights for business . Room ##s are d ##rab and d ##rea ##ry . No coffee maker . Sign in room says coffee in lobby in mornings , but I got dressed and went to lobby at 6 : 15 Friday morning and there was no coffee and no one around at front desk or in lobby . No newspapers available in lobby and generally sur ##ly interactions with staff . I wouldn ’ t return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie is a hotel just a bit out of ordinary . They offer you welcome drinks and compliment ##ary breakfast , served at the lifts where you can collect your eat ##ables and enjoy them in your own peace , in your own room . P ##ractical solution and no dinner hall needed . Hotel is within a walking distance from the subway . If you come from the airport by train , just get off at C ##lard / Lake station and walk 10 minutes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] this is a piece of Chicago history . rooms are great , food is good . close to everything Chicago es ##p Mill ##eni ##um Park . you can walk to the sites . there are many restaurant choices inside as well as outside the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great . Pool is on the 19th floor with a fun view of the city . Staff are friendly and helpful . Do not plan to utilize the pull out couch . . . it was absolutely terrible , we had to pull the mattress off the bed and put on the floor . Breakfast and evening social are a nice touch but the food is so - so ( compared to other Home ##wood suites that we have stayed at ) and it is crazy busy . Also be aware that the v ##alet parking ticket says to allow for 10 - 15 minutes to receive your car but the time frame is more like 30 - 45 minutes during check - out . It ' s an ok option but I think we will try something different next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in the So ##fit ##el for 3 nights . The rooms are really great especially the higher ones . Good location . Very pleased that the hotel went the extra mile sending me a forgotten possession back to my home . Great service and I would recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is awesome right in the middle of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , close to all the action and stores . It was also close to 2 Whole Food Market locations . I would stay again if we go back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] High ##ly recommended this hotel for the convenient location . The hotel architecture is beautiful and the holiday de ##cor was top notch . We upgraded to a suite which includes two restaurants and two closet ##s . The room was huge and the amenities were f ##abulous . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I rarely write reviews but this place is the best ! This is a great hotel with friendly , helpful staff and excellent amenities all for a reasonable price in the heart of River North . We have been coming here for years and highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hey was unhappy with the pre ##set temperatures of the room . The rooms were extremely hot and the bed felt as if I was sliding off of it . They did try and offer me another room but those rooms were hot as well so I declined . The the ##rm ##ost ##at is seasonal so even if you changed the settings in your room it would not get any cooler ( this came from the mouth of the lady working the hotel desk ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] The F ##ai ##mont Hotel was absolutely amazing . The view from the room was breath ##taking . I felt like I was a queen anywhere in the hotel . I was there on business and the food provided for the business event was as good as fine dining . This is a definite must stay experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Te ##rrible experience . We stayed for a few days during a convention and it was not an enjoyable stay . The staff is just outright rude , and con ##des ##cend ##ing . Was given a room that was old room with an odor , and the only other room without charging was an accessible room . For anything else they wanted to charge more , for a renovated room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , great location , updated , friendly staff , love it . The 67 ##6 restaurant food is great , staff was so nice . Love that they gave us wine when we came in from a cold shopping trip ! Overall just wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 4 nights with kids . Lu ##x ##uri ##ous , clean and modern de ##cor . Super use of space . We ##l ##coming staff on the ground level entrance because the reception is on the 20th floor . Love ##d the beds and the extra large TV ! Super location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ' t beat the location ! Walking distance to great shopping , restaurants and attractions . Close to public transportation to travel all over Chicago . Staff was very friendly and professional . The rooms were amazing and very comfortable . Ce ##le ##bra ##ting a birthday and the staff provided a little " extra ' surprise for the birthday girl in our room . Worth the price to be comfortable , safe and p ##amp ##ered . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed on the 33rd floor in a King Executive room . Great view of the river and city especially at night . Very convenient location for shopping , eating and entertainment . Vale ##t service was pro ##mpt and court ##eous . Front desk and bell service was outstanding . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is my second stay at the Fair ##mont Millennium in Chicago so it has been a consistent incredible attitude of Man ##dan ##a , T ##ip ##hani and Mu ##gi . Of course , everyone in the staff is super professional and am ##ica ##ble , but these three persons , really went out of their way to help and have the best attitude . Con ##gratulations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall very good , love that the lobby is on the 20 floor and stuff on the ground is open doors for you . Location is excellent everything in walking distance even in the winter . Little disappointment was on arrival the menu in the bar and restaurant was very limited in between lunch and dinner . Some rooms are to close to neighbour building and you have to keep the blind ##s closet for privacy [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is one of the best hotels in Chicago . Great location and service . Room ##s are spacious and comfortable . I will stay here again as I am not certain that you can find a better place for comfort and convenience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for four nights this week and absolutely loved it - exquisite hotel , especially the lobby , and paying the little extra for a lake view room was so worth it . Amazing to see the sunrise over Lake Michigan each morning , and the room was lovely and spacious . Staff were so helpful , enthusiastic and all around lovely - nothing was ever too much trouble . Special mention to the door ##men , who were so cheerful and welcoming every morning despite the cold , and the wonderful cleaning staff who were lovely , as well as those on reception who welcomed us so warmly and were so inform ##ative . Great location , and would 100 % recommend to anybody wanting to visit Chicago . Thank you so much for making our holiday so wonderful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Palmer House is an institution , and one everyone should stay in if they can . The restaurants are top notch , but the location is so great that you can get to many more . The look is classic and under ##state ##d . My kind of place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was unable to get to my reservation due to the 1 / 12 / 18 snow ##storm and car crashes that shut down I - 65 ##N . My ##self and the AAA agent both called twice trying to explain the weather conditions and the back ##log of cars between Lafayette , IN and Chicago . . . and nothing , not only could I not cancel , but they wouldn ’ t even allow me to modify the reservation to another weekend . Poor customer service for a me ##as ##ly $ 136 charge = loss of a lifelong customer . Will NE ##VE ##R book with this company again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] hotel is nice , quiet and relaxing just missing a microwave to re ##heat food for late nights or a fridge to keep food other than that the staff was nice checking in and most of all the lady that checked us out was ABS ##OL ##UT ##EL ##Y amazing , I ' d come back just because of her friendly personality [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a well over priced , dated hotel . Co ##b ##we ##bs in the room and light fitting ##s are older than W ##W ##2 times I guess ! Not worth for the price you end up paying with city tax etc . . . . Nevertheless the lo ##cat ##on was great next to the famous river with lots of tourists . Great city view and sea view ! Bed ##s were comfortable . Good collection of eating places are around in the walking distance . View around the Trump hotel and shopping on Michigan Avenue is great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Luck ##ed out with a room on the 44 ##th Floor . S ##lee ##k room design & wonderful views of Chicago made our stay more memorable . Plus the front desk staff & Con ##cier ##ge were really very helpful & friendly . We definitely felt expected . Staff knew why we were staying at hotel ( wedding ) and asked about it . Just a nice touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel with remarkable views and the location is in a prime spot . The staff members were all extremely nice and helpful . The Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago Hotel will be twice as better , once construction is finalized within the pool / gym area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##cel ##ent and warming welcome from host K ##wa ##me . I got an unexpected upgraded room in my first visit in a p ##ri ##vil ##ed ##ged Chicago area and historic building . A block away from ##the lake and nearby a food corridor . Behind the water tower and ma ##gni ##ficient mile . Re ##com ##men ##ded for history lovers . Pitt ##y I am just staying two days ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel at least 8 weeks this year . The staff is great , the rooms are excellent and the restaurant on the 20th is very solid . Finally a hotel that when you order room service , doesn ' t make you sign a bill : ) . Keep up the good work ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in a one bedroom suite with our two kids . The room was spacious and clean . Pool was very busy and the water m ##ur ##ky but kids loved it . Only two elevators so you have a wait when it is busy . Our room on the 17th floor was right below the pool . Made it a bit noisy with a busy pool area . En ##joy ##ed the views and our breakfast . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was by far my best hotel stay ever . The bed was very comfortable . The blind ##s allowed you to sleep in without the light peering through . Other than the cost of parking , I have no complaints . The staff was re ##sp ##ons ##ive . The food was great ! The pool was warm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Such a great location ! The heart of Michigan Avenue ! It ’ s in walking distance of excellent shopping , eating , and entertainment ! The hotel is lovely , ups ##cale , and attached to the Michael Jordan ’ s St ##eak ##house . It has a Star ##bu ##cks downstairs as well - a plus in my book . It ’ s also around the corner from Garrett ’ s Pop ##corn as well as the NBC studios . Great , name brand shopping in walking distance - high end and low end . High ##ly recommended ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly coming back with my family ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying at the Kim ##pton , great service from the staff and very impressed with the attention to details such as umbrella , yoga mat in the room . The hotel provides free drink daily at 5 ##pm , although we weren ' t able to part ##ake . Like ##d the fact that there were full size s ##ham ##po ##o , condition ##er , and body wash in the shower , much more environmental ##ly conscious than the the travel size containers . Downtown location makes it ideal for business and is within easy com ##mu ##te to restaurants and shopping . Best of all is the reasonable price for the room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Hotel in Chicago is amazing ! The bed , pillows , and linen ##s feel like a spa experience . Staff all around ( front desk , doorway , restaurant , cleaner ##s , con ##cier ##ge ) take their time con ##s ##cie ##nti ##ously to talk , help and answer questions . I highly recommend Chicago ' s O ##m ##ni Hotel . We have stayed here several times and this occasion was for the marathon . Access ##ibility to everything is easy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here with three adults and two kids . The bedroom had two queen beds and there was a sofa bed in the sitting room , which more than met our needs . There ' s a full kitchen with supplies and the location is excellent with public parking available in the next building . Our only issue was with the sire ##ns outside ( un ##av ##oid ##able if you are staying downtown Chicago ) and a party next door which didn ' t quiet down until a knock on the door at midnight . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were lucky to find this hotel for a 4 day stay for a family occasion ! ! They have a compliment ##ary breakfast as well as a free Happy Hour every day ! Staff are friendly & helpful . Hotel is within walking distance of main avenue ##s , wonderful restaurants & attractions . The con ##cier ##ge found us an awesome U ##ber driver who took us everywhere during our stay . Room ##s were clean & spacious . We would definitely stay there again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I usually love Hilton properties . I got a room on the eighth floor which I found out is by the pool . After un ##pack ##ing and settling in , I realized it ’ s impossible to sleep . I have a four - year - old and a 18 month old grand child staying here with me . They can ’ t sleep due to all the talking in the hallway . Don ’ t stay on the eighth floor . It ’ s going to be a long night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I made a booking error and the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker was extremely helpful in the resolution of my error ! The con ##cier ##ge was super helpful and third ##ly , the bed pillows were of a variety of thickness ! ! Rather than all p ##oof ##y , thick pillows there were two that were thinner and ' just right ? ' Did I mention v ##alet parking ? This is where we will definitely stay our next Chicago visit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conference and loved it . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful for places to din ##e . Was great to have the con ##cier ##ge lounge for breakfast , snack ##s and afternoon snack ##s . Clean and our room was very good sized . Nice and respect ##ful cleaning staff . Glad we chose this hotel ! Location f ##abulous ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Since I only used it to sleep and did not take advantage of the amenities , it was ok . I did want a soaking warm bath one night to relax but the f ##au ##ce ##t would not allow barely any warm water to be drawn into the tub . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my 2nd time staying at the Fair ##mont and it was just as nice as the first time I stayed . The staff here is super friendly and will try to assist you in any way possible . The check in and out experience was sea ##m ##less . We stayed in a king room on the 22nd floor . It was very nice . There are certain aspects of the room that are starting to get a bit out ##dated / run down , but these are very minor and don ' t take away from the experience . The room was much more spacious than similar hotels in the area . The bathroom also had a separate bath ##tub and shower which was great . I would stay here again when in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very impressed during my stay at this Kim ##pton . The hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms feature modern bathroom ##s and high quality beds . Se ##l from the Front Des ##k in particular was super helpful and at ##ten ##tive . The hotel ' s restaurant offers delicious meal options and is open for breakfast and dinner . Will definitely come back next year ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel am ##bian ##ce and de ##cor was excellent . The rooms were clean and spacious enough , with a nice sleek modern de ##cor . The library bar has one of the best Old Fashion ##s I ' ve ever had . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . Sc ##and ##i minimal style in large white rooms . Great value for this ch ##ic property set in one of the best locations to navigate the city . Staff has always been super helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I ’ ve stayed at this lovely hotel at least 7 times now . High ##ly recommend ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] O ##m ##ni Hotel Chicago is a wonderful place to stay . You will find the staff very helpful and pleasant , and you will find a very clean hotel , very plus ##h , and excellent ! The bell ##hop staff are very friendly and helpful . I really enjoyed my visit to this hotel . I will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ing in , I was made to wait for 15 minutes while one customer service attendant argued with another guest while the other stood there and " did paperwork " . Once helped , I was treated in a way that I was interrupting her day . Once in the room , I discovered that it is the smallest room ever ! Hard ##ly any room to move around . Also , the air condition ##er was not working . It was 76 in my room even though the the ##rm ##ost ##at was on 60 . I called down to the front desk and didn ' t even get an apology . She just yelled at me stating that the entire system was turned off . I asked for someone to open my window and bring a fan and she hung up the phone without saying a word . I will never stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Basic , class ##y , well - managed and staffed older hotel . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms . Excellent location if you like high - end shopping . Friendly staff . Hate ##d the computer tablet menu ##s in the restaurant and bar . The hotel would also benefit from a small gift shop with a variety of newspapers and magazines and sun ##dr ##ies . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would definitely give it 5 stars ! ! Check in was amazing & the guest staff was very much helpful ! They assisted with everything , and made sure my stay was comfortable . Even gave me a compliment ##ary upgrade for my room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perry and v ##alle ##t crew were amazing . Hu ##ge un ##load process was made easy and everyone at the hotel was great . Can ##not say enough good things about the v ##alle ##t staff . Thank you for everything , and will continue to always stay here when in town . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We love Kim ##pton and the All ##egro in particular , but this visit was very disappointing . We had an early check in , which was nice , but to the smallest room ever for our family of four . The front desk staff seemed distracted and put out , which is not the norm . And our room was right across from the gym , which meant that it was noisy to boot . I had to ask for extra towels and pillows even though I had requested them when I booked online . I also had work to do while I was there and the W ##i ##F ##i was spot ##ty . Long story short , we won ’ t be returning to the All ##egro anytime soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ' t ask for anything more ; this is a great place to have as a base to explore the Wind ##y City . We walked the city from the Fair ##mont and would always come back to a warm and welcoming hotel ( great views ) . Millennium Park , the Art Institute , Athletic Club , Chicago River ##walk and so much more , is only a short walk away . Columbus Ta ##p had some great options ( try the porch ##etta ) and the breakfast was p ##lent ##iful , with good quality options . Don ' t hesitate to stay here next time you ' re in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great rooms , spacious , clean and com ##fy . The restaurant is great , I had a delicious steak there . Staff is friendly and helped a lot to explore the city . It ’ s also well located . Would definitely come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was as expected and had facilities to support the meeting I attended . At check in , the clerk was very helpful to provide us with the best possible view ( partial river ) without paying the up charge for a better room . The bathroom ##s are somewhat dated in design . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a holiday party at the palm ##er house over the weekend . Thank technology for e - check in and electronic keys because the line to check in was at minimum a half hour wait . The service at pot ##ter ' s inside the hotel was di ##sma ##l . After a 5 minute wait to order a beer at the bar . They served it pink warm . I asked for a frost ##ed glass and he said he was all out . 10 minutes later the bartender asked if we were ready to order food , but never gave us a menu . Our beers were empty before he returned with the menu ##s . We decided to take our dining business elsewhere . The hotel room was very small with no amenities . I wouldn ' t stay here again , this place seems under ##sta ##ffed and mi ##sman ##aged . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we loved our stay at the ta ##l ##bot . the price was wonderful , room was very clean , employees were friendly bar was really cool and the happy hour was excellent . also in a great area of the city . will definitely return next time in ch ##ica ##go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time in Chicago and stayed here for a business trip - the location was great . Right off Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , it was easy to get to major tourist attractions and across town to the convention center . It ' s a bit of an odd setup , the lobby is on the second floor but I had a great corner room suite , so lots of light ! Would definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conference and was very pleased with the Hotel . It is a huge place , but very well kept and I would happily come back . Hotel is right next to the Grant Park which offers opportunities for walks , but a bit ( 10 min cab ) away from downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not an ideal hotel . Great view and in walking distance to Navy Pier and Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , but I will stay at the surrounding hotels and walk across the street next time ! Room ##s could be cleaner - had to be moved to a different room due to uncle ##an sheets ( y ##uck ! ) . Conference facilities were nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was just re ##mo ##del ##ed and it is improved . The beds and furniture comfortable . Bath ##room and closet ##s were very large and spacious . The compliment ##ary w ##if ##i runs at a good speed , it seldom stalled . It is one block from the subway and one block from Michigan Avenue and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . A good Whole Foods is a few blocks away and I was able to eat my usual foods and cut down on eating out . Eat ##aly is right around the corner , G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s a few blocks north of the hotel , and many more restaurants than I can count ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , friendly staff , Special shout out to B ##rit ##t ##ney - very helpful , inform ##ative and a pleasure to talk with . Location was very convenient . The only draw back was the layout of our room - had a desk that was shoved in a corner and couldn ' t really be used , the TV was on a s ##lanted wall and there was no room for a couch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was OK for b ##uns ##iness - if for a vacation trip - I would miss some more conform ##t , specially for potential children - also some better advise on location and transportation would be advise on [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel location is great . Our conference was in the hotel , so I didn ' t need to go to find restaurants , unless I wanted to . There was a store across the street , which is nice if you have forgotten something . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t has been my favorite hotel in Chicago though this was my first stay after their change in ownership and room renovations . I miss the old d ##é ##cor but the quality of service at the hotel is luck ##ily at the same high standard . In particular i want to compliment a house keeping staff person named Se ##mara Washington who went above and beyond her job duties by making sure I was accommodate ##d with a room change because the guest staying before had violated the anti - smoking rule and left the room with a horrible smell . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was great . Co ##m ##fort ##able , clean , and relaxing . Great bed , shower , and sitting area . We enjoyed the staff , especially Craig the con ##cier ##ge . He was always kind and helpful . The hotel is located in the Golden Mile of Chicago shopping and activity . We were able to walk to various points of interest and enjoy the architecture of Chicago . High ##ly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here numerous times and always look forward to coming back ! The location is wonderful and the staff is efficient and extremely friendly . Room ##s are clean and very nicely furnished . Re ##com ##men ##d to anyone coming to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I try to stay at Kim ##pton hotels when I go away since they are always in a great location , unique settings , and the friend ##liest staff . This Hotel Monaco kept the excellent streak of satisfaction ongoing . Location is right in the Loop , most of the city attractions are within a mile or less of this property , lots of restaurants right nearby ( Emerald Loop and Miss Ricky ' s are a couple ) , and the train is only a few blocks away . In typical Kim ##pton style , they have their social hour but they also have wonderful waters near the elevator . Always a fresh lemon water and the other was either straw ##berry water or cu ##cum ##ber water . Room ##s were clean , quiet , and anything you requested was delivered quickly . I would definitely recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] A very welcoming hotel , within walking distance of a lot of Chicago ’ s highlights . It is also near travel links such , as the bus or subway . It ’ s a popular spot in a vibrant part of the city , there are many restaurants nearby ranging in price , giving you the taste of America . The hotel itself is unique and nice to look at , very clean with comfortable warm rooms . All of the hotel staff are friendly , welcoming and very helpful . Our stay was made easy and great because of the hotel . The only issue we came across was the body wash in room gave us both a r ##ash , so maybe bring your own . Also not a issue , and a heads we were given , is a tax you need to pay on exit . Overall really recommend staying . Already one of my favourite cities in the world . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is exquisite ! Friendly staff , very comfortable , and right in the heart of great restaurant and shopping . Even if you are not a big swimmer be sure to check out the pool , it ’ s stunning with lots of architectural details . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Second stay as a Diamond , much improved ! We were in town for the blues f ##est , location can ’ t be beat . There were some co ##sm ##etic issues with wall ##paper and window shear ##s ; but , on the whole quite good . The need to seriously re - think the Executive Lounge , it like eating in a hallway . Staff were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed our three day stay at The Palmer House . It is a beautiful property very convenient ##ly located . We went to watch Hamilton , which is only two blocks away from hotel . The Palmer House is surrounded by great restaurants too . The rooms are clean and comfortable . The lobby is stunning . We simply loved our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff are exceptionally polite and professional . The rooms are clean and well set up . The d ##é ##cor is calming and pleasant . Am ##er , who attended the door , was a con ##su ##mma ##te professional and took great pride in being able to assist me . [SEP]
0	[CLS] this place was affordable , clean , and within walking distance of downtown activities . the staff was friendly . the room was average but it was as expected . i would stay here again next time i go to ch ##ica ##go . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A magical hotel , q ##uin ##tes ##sent ##ial Old Chicago . My family of four looks forward to our visit every year . Special shout out to Shane ##ka at the front desk for sending us a special treat that made our stay that much sweet ##er . ( b ##t ##w I keep seeing reviews that mention bugs and in all my years I have never seen one ) I am so happy they restored this beautiful hotel ! Please keep it up ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] After a long day in meetings it ' s nice to know that my room was clean , comfortable , well decorated in art ##ful and colorful furniture pieces . Un ##ique room de ##cor ##s , taste ##ful and different great for the frequent travel ##er ! Love ##d the robes provided , linen and bed was comfortable as well as oversized . Full snack and beverage purchase available in the room . Great location to the train to the airport as well as to other areas of Chicago . A must visit on your next Chicago business or fun trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] can ' t beat the O ##m ##ni , great place , great people , exceptional service . always my recommendation when asked by colleagues or friends . from check in to check out you are made to feel special , important , and most importantly welcome . after receiving our car from v ##alet door ##man offered us directions and a bottle of water ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of the nice ##st hotels we ' ve ever stayed in . We had a river view room with window seats that had an amazing view . Bed ##s were comfortable and room clean ##liness was perfect . Hu ##ge bathroom and the room itself was very room ##y . Door ##men were helpful and very nice , as was all of the staff . High ##ly recommend this hotel ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is rated as a 4 star hotel with nice pictures posted on their website . As so ##o as we walked in , we knew this hotel is nowhere close to 4 star rating . Dirty carpet ##s , furniture in very poor condition , everything dusty , AC not working in the room , bugs crawling in windows . We called agency we booked with and cancelled the reservation with assurance from hotel and agency staff that money will be re ##fu ##nded with no penalties or fees . Yes , we got the re ##fu ##nd but than the hotel charged our credit card for some ridiculous amounts with no authorization from us . We are very disappointed and would not recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This property looked great from the H ##H website . Looks can be de ##ceiving . Ho ##rrible rooms . Ho ##rrible staff . Peel ##ing wall ##paper , p ##eel ##ing paint , dirty carpet . Breakfast was the same thing every morning nothing changed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed a 14th floor corner suite with wonderful views of the surrounding city . There was a living room with sofa , desk , t ##v and adjacent kitchen ##ette ( sink , dorm fridge , coffee maker ) . Sep ##arate bedroom with bath that ad ##join ##s both the bedroom and living room . Did not hear the street noise below ! Did not hear noise from any other room or the hallway . . . w ##ow ! Super convenient location along the Miracle Mile . Very friendly service , easy check - in and check - out ( just drop your keys in the box at the elevator and they ' ll email you a re ##ceipt ) . Very good stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived early afternoon and usual check in was 2 or 3 hours later but we got a room promptly which was great . Front desk was very helpful and kind . The de ##cor fits the building with a lot of wood and some brass . Generally , an old style hotel , very clean and un ##c ##lut ##tered . Bar area was comfortable and food was very good . The room we got was very small with little room to move around . If we had ordered room service I don ' t know where they would have positioned the table . We did see other rooms which were at the same rate and were much more spacious . The location is great and everything you want to do is easily accessible . I would stay there again but would be more particular about the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had an amazing time , staff friendly and very helpful . Breakfast was amazing and filled us up for the day ! ! ! Location good , easy to walk to the Subway , train and buses ! ! ! B ##rill ##iant hotel and well kept ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Some of the recent reviews " scared " us . When we arrived , the staff was very helpful and court ##eous . We self - parked across the street for $ 28 per night as opposed to $ 70 for v ##alet . Hotel is great location for park and happening ##s downtown . Very clean , no issues with check - in , room clean ##liness or access . Columbus Ta ##p was a bit over - priced , but the staff was wonderful and the drinks were great . I fully recommend the Fair ##mount and don ' t pay attention the negative comments . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is with great pleasure to give the Talbot ##t a 5 star rating along side D ##wayne ! D ##wayne was absolutely the best bell ##man / con ##cier ##ges we have had . We typically stay at he four seasons and were re routed this trip due to booked hotels for on ##cology convention . We had a horrible experience at our Previous hotel and landed at the Talbot ##t at midnight on Sunday June 3rd . Michael at the front desk and Ariel were f ##abulous and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and we will most define ##lt ##y be back l . The entire bar staff was equally as outstanding ! Our room Was b ##oo ##ed under our design firm Kali ##ed ##os ##cope design . Excellent and 5 stars ! Please let your staff know Angela and Cass will be back ! T ##H ##an ##ks ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has my favorite location in Chicago . It ' s close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , but misses a lot of the street noise . The river views are great and it ' s worth up ##grading to a river view room . Room ##s that face W ##aba ##sh may get some noise from the El , although those trains don ' t run all night . . The rooms are good sized , reasonably quiet and I love the large bathroom ##s . It ' s well worth signing up for the loyalty program in advance . It gets you free w ##i - fi and a $ 10 credit towards the bar or your mini ##bar . We like the bar at the South Water Kitchen so much that we often pause here before catching the train home . They emphasize local beers and have interesting cocktail ##s . It ' s also pretty me ##llow for a hotel bar , which can be nice when travelling . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Older hotel in safe residential area near the lake . Vale ##t parking was $ 67 , way too much for this hotel . Staff members were very friendly . The lobby and hotel are beautiful , but the style and el ##egan ##ce of the main floor doesn ’ t match the rooms . Our room was clean , but very dated . . . like a room and bathroom at your great grand ##ma ’ s house . Might stay here again , but it ’ s time to re ##nova ##te . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a spacious corner room facing south and west . Starting around 6 ##am every morning the street would be so loud no one in my family could sleep . There was ho ##nking all morning and evening . This was disappointing as the rest of the stay was nice . I wouldn ’ t stay here again because of the noise . Maybe the side away from Michigan a ##ve is quiet ##er . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Tracy in house ##keeping was an angel ! My room was always taken care of and she has a great personality . Hotel was beautiful and food was great . Dr ##ink ##s were expensive but that was the only negative . Beautiful views as well . Perfect location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our f ##abulous stay started at check - in with Sean at the reception area . Sean was welcoming , warm yet professional , and made us feel happy to be there . We also enjoyed being so close to Grant Park & the Lal ##apa ##lo ##oz ##a music festival . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve been to Chicago many times and we stayed at So ##fit ##el 3 times , it is by far one of the best hotels in Chicago , and not only Chicago . Design is beautiful , staff is amazing , rooms are great , breakfast is fantastic ! ! ! We will definitely come back again ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone was always welcoming and friendly . . . from desk front staff , to cleaning crew , to waiter ##s and baggage handle ##rs . The hotel is very clean , the fruit flavor ##ed water at the entry very re ##f ##reshing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love this hotel and as always we were right in choosing it for our family stay . Top notch quality and Co ##vid prepared ##ness - great location and friendly service at their high bar / diner . Food exceptional and was very enjoyable . Will always have this in top places for my stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d our stay at The So ##fit ##el Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Our very spacious luxurious room was very clean with brilliant views over Lake Michigan from the 34th floor . The location is ideal for getting around Chicago on foot . I have to say this Hotel has one of the best French past ##ry chef ##s world wide . Their French past ##ries were second to none ! ! As a result room service had a good work ##out ! The con ##cier ##ge Bernard was most helpful and as a result we feel we were able to see a lot more of Chicago than we had originally planned . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just got home from a 3 night stay . We had a spacious and beautifully decorated corner suite . From the moment we arrived the staff was warm and welcoming . This hotel has the best location . It ’ s in the theater district , close to magnificent mile for shopping and just a block away from the trains for a short ride to any of the sport stadium ##s . We ate one meal at their restaurant , Fi ##sk and Co . Everyone in our party had something different and it was all delicious . Their front desk staff was friendly and helpful by booking us our river boat tour , making dinner reservations and sharing some info about sights we ’ d enjoy . We will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] THE ST ##AF ##F IS K ##IN ##D , caring and very pro ##fe ##ds ##ional Breakfast great with fruits , hot dishes , past ##ries and juice ##s . The manager re ##ce ##otion from mon ##day to th ##rus ##day just a plus where they served wine , juice ##s , salad ##s . , , , [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time at the Conrad . The stay 100 % exceeded expectations . I particularly recommend Baptiste & Bo ##ttle , for both food quality and bar ##man who really knows what he ' s doing . I will return at every opportunity ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am disappointed to say that Inter ##con Chicago was my least favorite Inter ##con that I visited around the world , although the building looks wonderful from the outside and I always wanted to stay there , I was shocked that there was a clear cost cut in the rooms , the v ##alet never offered any help while I was clearly struggling to get my bags through the door , the customer service is very low and the employees seem unhappy to work there , to top it off , there is no coffee in the room . I will always chose to stay in a holiday inn over Inter ##con in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great breakfast & social hour , short walk or u ##ber to everything . Get a room with a view , totally worth it . Noise ##s from the 19th floor pool can be annoying . Staff is absolutely top notch , can ' t say enough about them ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] During last week ' s Polar V ##ortex , we closed on our Chicago home of 27 years , and I wanted to guarantee the weather did not interfere with my attending the closing . My husband is a Kim ##pton member and forward ##ed the contact info . I called Cassie at the front desk , and immediately knew I was in good hands . Easy check - in hours , lovely appointments and design , a Pro ##se ##co happy hour , Lo ##bby bar with great bartender ##s . Next door is the Cadillac Theatre and a wonderful Italian restaurant is also attached . The room was beautiful and comfortable . I slept well , and will return with my husband for a special treat . Formerly the famous B ##ism ##ark Hotel . A beautiful renovation . En ##joy . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I cannot say enough good things about this hotel . The location is perfect on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , the staff from check in to the door ##man are genuine and friendly . The rooms are im ##ma ##culate and the beds are heavenly . I travel to Chicago every February and this is the only hotel I will stay at . If you ’ ve never stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal , I would highly recommend this hotel , you don ’ t know what your missing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for three nights ; very big hotel but friendly staff at check - in and my room was of a good size with a big bathroom , good shower and com ##fy bed . All very clean and well presented . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed that no swimming pool in a hotel of this size and the fitness area is under ##w ##hel ##ming . More Holiday Inn than what I ' d expect from a Fair ##mont . Good bar / pub in the lobby . Nice beers , friendly staff . Col ##league ate and said it was good . Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love that this property is situated A ##WA ##Y from the tourist ##y spots . The area is very lovely . It ' s perfect for short trips since it lacks amenities like a pool , large gym , etc . I would love to see more amenities tailored to kids as my husband was left to entertain them when I had business meetings . The staff were very friendly and the food was good . Self - parking was quoted at three different rates from the time I called and made the reservation , checked in , and then versus what we actually paid to leave the garage . I was pleased they accommodate ##d our early check - in time so I could make a meeting downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a wonderful weekend in Chicago . This hotel was in a great location , very well kept , and beautiful views . The staff were excellent . Especially Suzanne at the con ##cier ##ge desk . She was so helpful and generous . She planned our ex ##cursion and they were great . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
0	[CLS] When I arrived at this hotel I felt O ##MG , will I really enjoy my staying here , however the hotel staff were very friendly and I truly enjoyed my staying , clean , warm , almost impossible to get lost , very easy to get back to the hotel , great night life loved it [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was perfect ! From check - in to Select Guest to room service and check - out . . . perfect and extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Without hesitation I would highly recommend becoming an O ##m ##ni regular . . . in fact I have on several occasions suggested O ##m ##ni over the other national , industry brands . Keep up the good effort ##ing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for a conference . The guest rooms were much nice ##r than I expected for the group rate that I paid . Bed ##ding was very comfortable and the bathroom ##s were a nice size for a downtown hotel . Staff was friendly throughout my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff goes above and beyond in their attempt to be helpful and accommodate all of your needs . As soon as I entered my room I received a text message from the hotel staff asking how my room looked and if I needed anything . This was a 1st time experience for me and I loved it ! Throughout my three night stay I would correspond with the hotel staff via text message on several occasions . The hotel bar is a unique experience as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bo ##uti ##que hotels have notorious ##ly small rooms , the Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro definitely fits that description . With that being said , the room was clean , towels stock ##ed daily , & beds made . Not noisy . Lo ##bby had compliment ##ary coffee in the mornings & prose ##cco in the afternoon ##s which is nice . Great area , 1 . 5 blocks to blue line train to O ' Hare , walking distance to all tourist sites downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here on a four day family trip and we were extremely satisfied . The rate was reasonable and it ' s convenient ##ly located near many of the local attractions . More importantly , the guest service was top notch . The front desk assisted us with any tours or plans we wanted to make for the day and was very friendly . Nice per ##ks included a free drink each night at happy hour and a continental breakfast located on each floor . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great views of the Chicago sky scrap ##ers and in all the action of shopping districts . This place was unprecedented . . . I thought the staff were friendly and efficient and the room was overall comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very beautiful hotel . Very friendly staff . The room was small but clean . Location was amazing . Al ##ot of things to do around and night ##life as well . Very content about this hotel ! Walking distance from interesting parts of the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited for three days with our kids and had a wonderful time ! The free breakfast was really good and there were different hot items every day . We drove from Michigan and got the package that included parking and in and out privileges . The Vale ##t team was amazing . They always got our car quickly , assisted with luggage and we were always greeted with kindness and a smile . Am ##er and his team do an amazing job and when we come back we will be staying in the same place and hope to have him help us again ! Great job , Home ##wood Suite ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was an excellent hotel with excellent staff and very nice rooms Ben V checked us in and he was amazing . Give this man a promotion he accommodate ##d our every request and explained everything very well . Great location and amazing hotel . I am a lifelong Swiss ##ote ##l fan . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my second stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It is two blocks from Michigan Avenue so you couldn ' t ask for a better location . The staff is friendly , helpful and court ##eous . The entire hotel is very unique , clean , smells wonderful and I love the candle ##light at night throughout the lobby . And , their rates are very reasonable . Can ' t wait to go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rate was great for December in Chicago . We loved the location ; easy access by foot to Michigan Avenue shopping . Also , there ' s several restaurant choices nearby . This was our second stay at this hotel , will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was comfortable for an ups ##cale hotel but room wasn ' t as reserved ( received a double room instead of a king as reserved ) . Car was damaged in v ##alet parking ( was told their self parking was unavailable ) . Room ##s for a large group of individuals were not ready at normal check in time ( I was number 60 on their list at that point and almost an hour later I was still number 35 ) . Location was great but would think twice about staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This place is so horrible I can ' t believe they ' re charging people to stay here don ' t take my word for it look at the pictures . They have the nerve to have a mini bar . There ' s no exhaust in the bathroom I ' m sure there is mold ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed three nights this week and was happy with the rooms and facilities and the fact that the location is very central close to the metro and good restaurants and bars - however very surprised by the layout of the lobby and the absence of a hotel bar or restaurant in that lobby ! There are however a lounge on the sixth floor but it is only open late afternoon - early evenings so for meeting up with large groups pick an external meeting ##point . I enjoyed my stay and will pro ##ably return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was amazing . Excellent staff and excellent breakfast b ##uff ##et . We loved the location . It was fantastic . The rooms were clean , everyone was warm and greeted us with respect and with kindness . We enjoyed ourselves and are looking forward to definitely coming back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is vast , but that does not take away from the service . Upon check - in , I had a slight issue with my room , and it was handled within minutes . They called me , sent me an email and sent someone up , and no joke , 5 minutes later I had a new room . I highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and I arrived in Chicago for a girls night last weekend . From the beginning , we loved everything about the Kim ##pton Monaco ! The location is f ##abulous ! The staff is S ##O friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , from the door ##men to the front desk . We were upgraded to a King Corner Suite which was AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! The only problem was that we didn ' t have more time to spend enjoying it ! The bed was super com ##fy , the eclectic de ##cor ##ating was warm and co ##zy , the updated bathroom and shower were large and the water pressure was great , and the 3 window seats were awesome for watching the city below us . We will absolutely look forward to staying here again ! Thank you to all who made us feel so welcome and comfortable ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel , excellent u ##bic ##ation , excellent service , excellent cleaning , very close to many es ##pect ##ac ##ular ##s restaurants , close to subway Chicago station ( red line ) , close to 360 building and Chicago Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I have stayed at the O ##m ##ni multiple times . It ’ s in a great location and the staff is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They will always be our first choice when visiting Chicago . Although we did not din ##e at the on ##site restaurant ( 67 ##6 ) this time , we have in the past and it very good . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend the O ##m ##ni . [SEP]
1	[CLS] During previous travel to Chicago we have stayed at the wonderful Pa ##lo ##mar Hotel but wanted to try something new with the Monaco . While the location was outstanding , close to great restaurants , ma ##g mile , etc . the hotel and customer service was not what I have come to expect from Kim ##pton . Check in was easy , however the front desk seemed un ##int ##ere ##sted in our questions . Our River View room was missing the window seat cushion ##s that I was excited about but the room itself is nice . We also found a used razor in the trash can when we arrived then the next day cleaning gloves were left on top of my makeup on the bathroom counter . Aside from the gross surprises our stay was decent , but will probably not return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Kim ##pton All ##egro is our go - to hotel for our Chicago visits . For a Chicago hotel , we always find a reasonable rate . It is in the Theater District & perfectly located to State St , MI Ave , River ##walk , Millennium Park , & River North . We love the Art Dec ##o design . Park ##ing for a couple nights ' stay is reasonable ( for city rates ) and convenient - just use the Spot Hero app . The lobby is spacious and there is a great area for gathering with friends and family with perfect access to the hotel bar . We stay in a king room and sometimes take the upgrade to allow us a couch and easy chair . The luxurious ( and clean ! ) animal print robes are so co ##zy ! Best of all , AL ##L the staff is friendly and helpful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I traveled to the Ki ##nz ##ie for business . Immediately I was impressed by how the staff handled the significant snow storm , with most guests changing their plans . Staff was welcoming and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The hotel has many impressive amenities , including a compliment ##ary evening reception including drinks and snack ##s from 5 - 8 ##PM . Breakfast was limited , but sufficient and available on every floor . This is an older building that has been nicely re ##mo ##del ##ed , but because of that you ' ll notice the rooms are smaller and it is easier to hear sounds in adjacent rooms . Also be sure to request a room with a view of Ki ##nz ##ie street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ( by the Chicago river ) in the downtown area . Plus , 24 / 7 market place inside the hotel as well as other restaurant options are a big plus . I would definitely recommend the hotel to others visiting the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visit this hotel every year . It is small enough to be a welcoming place , with staff that recognize me when I return , free coffee in the morning , and a wine hour in the evening . The rooms are very comfortable , and many have window seats . Also the location is favorable , within easy walking distance to the Loop , Millennium Park , the Art Institute , Michigan Avenue shopping and many restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I asked for and received early check in and late check out . I was given a great room with a view of Michigan Avenue and the beautiful Christmas lights . Sen ##t a text to Santa and got warm cookies and milk delivered to my room . Everyone was very helpful , and the breakfast was delicious . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you ’ re going to see Hamilton , The Palmer Hotel is so close and it ’ s an historic , beautiful , elegant hotel . So fun to have a cocktail in the Lo ##bby and watch people , and enjoy a relaxing couch to sit on after walking a million miles throughout Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was my husbands birthday and he was traveling for work . So being his wife I thought of planning something special for him . With me about 1200 ##4 km ##s away in India wrote a mail to the hotel to make him feel special . . . . and bang on . . . . a ch ##oc brown ##ie with champagne is what made his day with my special message . Thank you team and special thanks to o ##s ##bal ##do . Ch ##eers . . . . much appreciated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great choice for a Ho ##bby ##ist ' s get - together , central , affordable , and efficient . Breakfast and Happy Hour were satisfying and had good choices . Ban ##quet services for a small group were very good with at ##ten ##tive staff . El ##eva ##tors were over ##ta ##xed based on number or guests and staff using them . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First I ##mp ##ression of this place was that I loved the building itself . It ' s a very beautiful historic building . I arrived on a Saturday so it had almost a club like atmosphere . I would say the staff that I encountered were nice enough but not overly friendly , but efficient . The rooms are average ##ly furnished . Kind of boring . But , I did really like the lighting . It was good mood light . The room was very small , however . I don ' t travel light , so I had trouble finding places for everything to be out of sight . Even though it said on the website that it was 350 - 400 sq ft ( there ##s no way ) The bathroom was nice and good sized . Although I do wish hotels would stop with the modern shower ##s . They make it hard to s ##have your legs lo ##l . At least put a foot rest or something ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker was located in a perfect spot inside the Loop of Chicago . Walking distance to all the great shopping on Michigan A ##v . Historic sights such as Water Tower . Only a few blocks from Lake Michigan . Walking distance to the Chicago Water for tours . The hotel has everything you need , it is on the small side , but well appointed . We had breakfast on the property , and it was reasonably priced and delicious . Our room was completely refurbished with a great bathroom , and plenty of room . P ##ric ##ing was well within reason for Chicago , and received a $ 50 food credit along with our room rate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The stay was quite enjoyable . The room had a great view . The staff was very pleasant and helpful . We had a great Easter br ##unch at the Tor ##to ##ise Room which was recommended by the con ##cier ##ge . I do wish they had better TV opportunities ( no Net F ##lix ) and the movie selection was limited . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location to participate in the city Marathon - though other hotels offered shuttle service and better runner support . This Hotel is only close to other CO ##NR ##AD hotels , like NY or other places . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t does not have movie channels which is a b ##um ##mer in a city with bad weather when you want to relax in your room and there is nothing on the t ##v channels . The elevators were extremely slow and we had no hot water ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : 1 . Super fast and has ##sle free check in 2 . Spa ##cious lobby 3 . Nice bar 4 . Co ##m ##fy sofa throughout lobby area 5 . Location ( very close to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Miles , River Walk , Mill ##eni ##um Park , Chicago Theater ) 6 . Spa ##cious room . Con ##s : 1 . Price Verdi ##ct : Would stay here again and highly recommended for river north area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a nice hotel . The staff were friendly and kind , per usual with Kim ##pton . The Lo ##bby area is im ##ma ##culate and exactly what you expect from a Kim ##pton hotel . My only issue , and why this is rated as average has to do with the clean ##liness of my room . upon arrival , I noticed several long black hairs all over my room - and I mean AL ##L O ##VE ##R . The hair was on my couch , my bed , and several in my bathroom . After I cleaned them up , the stay was nice . Try the bar / restaurant - The staff and service is wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , location , service , and food . Room service has the best breakfast around and the P ##ump Room has a great br ##unch . The staff is always very friendly and will make your stay very nice - - it will make you want to come back as we always do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and her now husband chose to host their wedding here and we are so glad they did . The W ##al ##nut Room was lovely , the staff led by Paige Le ##ffer ##t were professional , g ##rac ##ious and fun to work with . We hosted a post wedding br ##unch in the Savoy Room for family and out of town guests which provided a perfect conclusion to the weekend . A good time was had by all thanks to very good work by the All ##egro staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 4 nights for a vacation in July 2016 , and am very glad that we did . The room was clean and ( very ) spacious . Bed was com ##fy , air conditioning was strong , and while Chicago parking is terrible no matter what , the overnight parking here was less than the other hotels in the area . The best was the location - EA ##S ##Y walking distance to many of Chicago ' s big attractions and restaurants , and convenient to public transportation for everything else . I would happily stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was on the second floor right next to the neighbor hotel service entrance . It was very loud at all hours of the night . Bed wasn ’ t very comfortable , but overall the hotel was nice . El ##eva ##tors aren ’ t sufficiently sized for a hotel or this nature , but since we were on the second floor , it didn ’ t matter . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome location , easy to get around the area on foot ; easy to U ##ber to anywhere else in the city from there . Room was super nice ; they left the couch bed folded out because it wouldn ' t fold back in - a minor in ##con ##ven ##ience to us . Had a nice Bose stereo in the room , but no instructions on how to use it . Staff was very professional and polite . Some ##w ##hat surprised the hotel didn ' t have a location to purchase travel ne ##cess ##ities or snack ##s , but we found a 7 - Eleven a few blocks away so it wasn ' t a big deal . Really nice hotel , you just need $ $ $ ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador had just re - opened a few weeks before my stay . You would not have known it , as the staff and property operated met ##ic ##ulously . I can ' t imagine staying any place else when in Chicago . The Front Des ##k staff in particular were very at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel and staff were amazing . They knew it was my daughter ' s birthday and left cake , balloons and a card in the room for her . The breakfast that we had before we left was also delicious . Love this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed three nights at the hotel . The staff was at your be ##ckoned call . Antonio , Joshua & Sony ##a took great care to make sure all our needs were provided , The wine & ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres in the afternoon provided a nice time to relax after a day of adventure . The hotel is central ##ly located making it easy to walk around , catch " Hop on - Hop off " bus and the boat tour . Also close easy walk along the river trail . I would recommend this hotel for clean ##ness , service and location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is walking distance to Grant Park , Mill ##eni ##um Park , The Art Institute , River ##walk , and Soldier Field . It ' s a beautiful building with a gorgeous lobby . The rooms were sparkling clean with wonderful beds and a comfortable bathroom . This is an older , charming building . They ' ve moved to the larger bottle di ##spense ##rs for s ##ham ##po ##o and condition ##er and the s ##ham ##po ##o was empty . Need to stay on top of that . We ' d definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for the Premier of the new Transformers movie in Chicago . Hotel is great and staff is nice . However . . . we had our vehicle v ##alet parked and it was damaged on a curb or something . Of course no one assumed responsibility to the damage . We agreed to split the $ 500 worth of damage ( just because no one would f ##ess up and the manager Ch ##er ##bel said we " needed to work with him on this " imp ##lica ##ting that they were only do in it out of the kindness of their hearts . . . total crap ) . Still have not seen a check for the damage and now will not answer emails . . . . do not v ##alet here ! There is no account ##ability by the staff . Would have to say , if you don ' t have a car , great place . If you do have a vehicle . . . . go elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Deluxe Suite ##s are very modern , large , and recently refurbished . Bed ##s are so com ##fy and linen ##s top quality as one would expect . Staff are brilliant . The gym and pool are both very good . Another very good example of a fine Hotel chain which includes the ultra modern excellent properties in San Diego and Dallas . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay and within walking distance to museums and shopping and parks . Like that it was an iconic historical hotel . Staff friendly Cafe and restaurant in hotel a plus . Room very quiet with all amenities . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My boyfriend and I very much enjoyed our stay here at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago . We loved that the location was perfect for all of the areas of Chicago that we wanted to visit , and that our room had B ##EA ##UT ##IF ##U ##L views of the city . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Like many She ##rato ##n ’ s , the rooms were tired and be ##ige . But there is a but . As I stayed a week , I was placed on the 33rd Club floor free of charge and the staff were exceptionally charming except when my key stopped working and the has ##sle to get a new one was un ##rea ##son ##able . Great location , great views , great staff , but a little tired . The U ##ber ch ##ap really struggled to find it as we ended up under the hotel and he had no idea how to get to street level ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were just there for one night , but it was a very nice one night ! Very clean , great room and beds , super nice staff , and a great breakfast - what more can you ask ? ? I would definitely go back if I am in that part of town again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this hotel several times . We are never disappointed with the exceptional service and very comfortable room . If you are looking for a beautiful view of Chicago River and Lake the upper level rooms are outstanding . The staff is the best too . . always helpful to every request . A great location to walk to many attractions and restaurants . Our favorite place to stay ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our second time staying at the Ki ##ns ##ie hotel absolutely love it . The location is great . Staff is always wonderful and the rooms are very nice . I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pect ##ac ##ular view from our 27th floor room , wonderful bath products , excellent location for walking to shopping , restaurants , bars . Book ##ed on line . Look for the deals that includes parking as it saved us the $ 70 other nearby hotels were charging [SEP]
0	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s when my wife and I just want to have an excuse to get away . Always welcoming and extremely satisfied . Would recommend that you book / reserve the King suite with lake ##front pan ##ora ##mic view . T ##ruly beautiful to look out at sunrise and night time lights . Always , sets the mood for romance . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is in the heart of all the sights and activities in downtown Chicago . It made it easy to get to see and do all we wanted . Our room was kept clean on our three night stay , and was remarkably quiet and spacious . And the staff were all very friendly and helpful . Check in and out was a breeze . Love the evening social ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel location is great the rooms are very clean and plenty of space feel really con ##fort ##able I was a little disappointed when I found out that the hotel didn ’ t have a pool was very hot walking in Chicago , but I was very impressed with customer service overall but the lady at the front desk was very friendly her name is Ra ##quel and she makes you feel very welcome and she try to help in every , way she is the best that I have in customer service for long time and I travel a lot Good job Ra ##quel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely older hotel with history but updated very nicely . Location perfect for our situation . Came for convention and brought daughter and adult granddaughter ; they were able to walk or use ne ##ntal bikes to several attractions like aquarium , museums , and shopping . Hop on / hop off tour bus stop right in front and is a great bargain to tour the City and take to Navy Pier and other interesting stops . Grant Park right across the street . Will stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Absolutely f ##abulous hospitality , suites and amenities . The location is also perfect in the heart of the Ma ##g Mile and very family friendly . The wonderful loyalty program is a must to en ##roll in as well with un ##beat ##able per ##ks . A special thank you to all the staff that made our stay so amazing ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome Entry with a larger than life Christmas Tree . Staff was very friendly and helpful . The double queen rooms with two bathroom ##s are a great option when trying to get everyone ready for the day . My only complaint , bed ##ding was sub - par with thin , fl ##oppy small pillows and average sheets not the norm for a Hilton . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location in the golden triangle with lake , shopping , bars and restaurants all within minutes walking distance of the hotel . Very comfortable room and super helpful staff , a real credit to you [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you stay for more then a day , your room , your coffee , your cups will NO ##T be replaced . You ’ re on your own . I understand this is Co ##vid era , but things as such should be communicated to customer prior to extended stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] My best friend and I recently stayed here . Everyone was very nice , friendly and helpful . They treated us like royalty . Craig is there everyday to start the day with a friendly smile and good advice . The wait staff in the Nix made breakfast a pleasure . The Martin ##i Bar was co ##zy and had live music . The location is a half a block from the Ma ##g Mile : close to shopping , night ##life and restaurants . We love Chicago - - we will be staying there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great customer service ! Actually left my eye ##glass ##es worth $ 500 . 00 , in an U ##ber . The U ##ber took them to Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal . Nate Crawford went above and beyond the call of duty to help me locate them and get them to Fed ##X . Great service from check - in to my mistake . Between U ##ber and Nate , they made it an even better experience ! Thank you ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hello , My recent stay in Chicago was only improved by staying with you once again . Last m ##th . , I departed the day before the P ##ump Room was taking it ' s last bow . I was happy to see that it ' s replacement , Booth One ' is humming along nicely . I look forward to returning soon to see the final results . By the way , while I am in Chicago I generally need to host one or two meetings in my room . I cannot tell you how much I appreciate having the comfortable space to do so . Your staff is friendly and helpful from the sidewalk to the front desk . House ##keeping and room service are always pro ##mpt and thorough too . Many thanks for yet another successful trip to my favorite city and I will look forward to returning soon . Best , Leslie Mu ##eller Museum Access [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved the modern de ##cor ! The staff was very friendly and helpful . The beds were comfortable and the rooms were nice . My only grip ##es , the bathroom was very small , you could barely turn around , and the cleaning staff was rather loud in the mornings , slamming doors and such . I would absolutely stay there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at this hotel , was one of my best hotel stays yet . And I have had many . The compliment ##ary social in the evening and breakfast are very nicely set up . The staff from upon your arrival to departure are all very friendly . and helpful ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly would recommend this hotel to family and friends ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] When I come to Chicago for business , I always stay at this hotel . It is convenient ##ly located to everything ( restaurants , shopping , and my office ) . The staff is extra ##ord ##ina ##rily court ##eous and professional . The rooms are spacious and most importantly , quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I been there for the Chicago Marathon 2016 and it ' s was a perfect place to stay , is very accessible to every area you want to go . Trains , attractions , pharmacy and shops are basically at a walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended the IL ##F Conference in June . Room was ready for early check in - nice ! Too ##k the train in from Midway - very easy . Staff was wonderful . Any time I needed directions , instead of " right here , left there . . . " a staff member would stop what they were doing & actually walk me to my destination ! ! I wish I could remember any of their names , as they all deserve credit . Guess I ' ll message H ##ya ##tt separately with that information . Breakfast was very good every morning . Z ##umba , Maria & So ##bu ##j are very good wait staff & cash ##iers . Nice walk to the pier . Easy enough to get around locally via walking & buses . Would absolutely consider staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Five day business trip , pleasant ##ly surprised not just by the beautiful art - de ##co inspired interior , but by the way the hotel has created a so ##cia ##ble collaboration space with happy hour cocktail ##s , free coffee and other lovely touches like post ##cards that they will send for you . Restaurant 312 also highly recommended for both breakfast and dinner . Will book again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is our favorite place to stay when we are in Chicago . The hotel is in the best location and the staff goes above and be ##hon ##d to make eve ##yr ##thing perfect . The rooms are super clean and decorated nice . You are close to everything shopping . Everything is walking distance from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was great except they did not respect my room privacy . Clean ##ing staff entered my room multiple times when the privacy tag was on the door . Even after speaking to front desk , and house cleaning manager about this they still entered the room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We found the staff to be outstanding . Very polite , friendly and helpful . Our room and view were amazing . Everything was clean and modern . I would say it is one of the best experiences we have had and we have stayed in several different hotels in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this hotel as supposedly it was 4 . 5 stars . Would put this in the 3 . 5 - 4 star range . Not many pillows for the bed and after getting our bathing suits on ( family trip ) found out that the pool was eliminated - we were fool ##ed by the photos from before it was removed . The $ 20 resort fees includes coffee and tea but only B ##EF ##OR ##E 6 ##am . S ##mo ##oth ##ies are also a per ##k but none were available . All and all an OK stay but nothing special or worth a return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here about 10 years ago and loved it . This weekend I was disappointed . There was water damage on the walls in our bathroom . The pillows were over used and need updated . I called the front desk at 1 am be ##c there were people yelling and slamming doors . It continued for hours . I would expect someone to do S ##OM ##ET ##H ##ING at a hotel of this caliber . You have to go to the basement for v ##alet service . I waited over 15 minutes for them to bring my car , but 2 couples after me got their cars in about 3 - 5 minutes . There was no apology . No staff members ever smiled at me . I had a much better experience at the Mar ##riot ##t last year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked and paid through a 3rd party site and for some reason it didn ' t show in their system even though we had our confirmation and credit card statement showing we paid . We waited over an hour and finally they put us in a small room with 2 double beds ( not what we paid for ) . Then we get a bill for 1200 $ because they made a mistake . It was taken care of but we weren ' t offered any type of apology or breakfast or anything like that . The room was mug ##gy and smelled must ##y . The sheets were stiff and felt like a ta ##rp . We were very disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was in beautiful location with so much to do near by . However the staff was less than friendly and rude . The parking attendant ##s were amazing they deserve a raise ! The rooms are beautiful but service is everything and I won ' t be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I took a weekend trip to Chicago in mid - May . The staff at the Ki ##nz ##ie was amazing and always friendly ! Every time we came or left they greeted us . They texted to ask how are stay was and how they could make it better . If you are adults with no children this is a great hotel . The breakfast by your elevator was very delicious and convenient . Their gym was pretty good considering it is a hotel , variety of work ##out equipment and very clean . We will come back in future trips to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although the hotel was not fully open , staff were great and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Was actually there 2 different nights about 2 weeks apart . On return the second time the business center was reopened and Mi ##che ##al Jo ##rdon St ##eak house scheduled to re ##ope ##n shortly . Room ##s were great as Always ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located and comfortable . Nice to have a bar and restaurant in the hotel . Great location ##j . Really liked the wonderful s ##ham ##po ##o and body wash in the rooms . All the staff were very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we enjoyed our two day stay in this historic hotel . room was clean , comfortable and the bed and pillows outstanding . Great Location , close to everything . Would stay again and hope to do so soon . Coffee in room is always a good way to start the day and the coffee provided along with tea got us up and ready for our day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in went great with Sean ! He was very helpful ! Room ##s were clean and spacious . A few places to eat in the hotel . Well located by the park and about 1 mile to the river ##front . Staff assisted in getting cab ##s or directing u ##ber ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has just renovated most of the top floors . Everything looks fresh and new . The new beds were great to sleep on . Custom ##er Service is excellent . Had a great stay . The Palm restaurant is being renovated and will start serving breakfast once it has been completed . Looking forward to eating there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , easy access to many areas of the city . Quiet and clean . We were never disturbed at all when in the room . The H ##ya ##tt seems to have everything you need , with the exception of a pool ! Didn ' t end up having time for that anyway ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great place . Very well located in Chicago spacious room and good breakfast . I would definitely stay at this hotel next time in Chicago . Service was very good Two blocks away from Michigan a ##v The gym is not as good as I expected . Could be better [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel on Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Not the first time I ' ve stayed and on all occasions it ' s been great . Perfect location and staff are friendly and helpful . The breakfast selection is good too and I have diet ##ary requirements . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This had an amazing view and the service was the best I ' ve ever had at a location . They really know how to anti ##ci ##pate your needs here . Then not only meet but exceed them from the moment you walk into the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent one night here pre - Co ##vid and was very impressed . Clean spacious room up to Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal standards . I ’ m a S ##pire Ambassador so quite happy with the upgrade . Hu ##ge bathroom with powerful shower . Breakfast downstairs was also excellent and was of high quality . Always thankful for my 4 ##pm check outs as I had a 7 ##pm flight to London . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wedding party staying on are floor where they stayed up all night finally around 1 : 30 AM asked the people sitting in the hall if they would go to there room because of the noise could not get any sleep made for a long day of site seeing the next day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a larger hotel and I attended a conference here . There is a large mall directly across the street that made shopping and restaurant choices easily available if you don ' t have a car . Staff were a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice bout ##ique hotel in great location and outstanding service from the front desk staff G ##ism ##era ##it . The hotel is hip , and walking distance to Michigan Ave . and many great restaurants and night ##life . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My favorite part of the Conrad experience was mastering the controls of lights and curtains in the room . Conrad guest rooms allow precision control of room temperature and light levels . Everything about the hotel felt new and exceeding ##ly well - furnished . Conrad Chicago is also ideal ##ly located less than a block from Michigan Ave . All of the City ' s best shopping and dining is within a few minutes walk . Even the walk to the Hamilton Theater was less than 15 minutes . Love ##d the N ##es ##press ##o Machine in the room , so far superior to Ke ##uri ##g basic coffee makers . Breakfast in the 20th Floor Cafe was excellent . Even the Hotel G ##ym was quite nice . First hotel I ' ve stayed in where the Lo ##bby was above all the guest floors . If you ' re considering this Conrad , just book it ; you will be glad you did . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First trip to Chicago for a sports - filled weekend . Found Hotel Monaco because it was less expensive than anywhere else , but I don ' t expect that will be the case for long . This place was fantastic . Right on the river , easy 10 - 15 minute walk to anywhere in River North . 3 minute walk to the L lines . ~ 30 minutes from Midway , W ##rig ##ley , Soldier Field . We never took a cab anywhere . Room was spacious , beds were comfortable , staff was very court ##eous and helpful . Free w ##i - fi was great . Room was ready for early check - in . They held our bags on day of check out when we had an evening flight . Will definitely consider for my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room large and clean with nice view of the Chicago River . See p ##ics . Perfect location for shopping and sights ##ee ##ing . The wine hour at 5 pm sets the mood for the rest of the evening . A more historic look inside than the newly renovated ( modern ##ized ) Burn ##ham hotel . First visit but we will certainly return . The next - door South Water Kitchen restaurant a plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small ##est bathroom I have seen Service @ front desk excellent Room de ##cor . . . . g ##aris ##h and out ##dated Poor lighting . . . . . . seating area and work area View of roof and air handle ##r . . . . . windows had metal Me ##sh . . . . maybe like a prison ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I planned a last minute trip to Chicago for my birthday and choose to stay at the Fair ##mont because we have enjoyed staying at Fair ##mont ##s in other cities . We were offered an upgrade to the gold lounge level for a nominal fee and are so happy we did . Can ’ t say enough about how great the staff is in the lounge . The con ##cier ##ge at the hotel helped in suggesting some great restaurants and made reservations for the architectural boat tour . Location of the hotel is great . E ##asily walk ##able to millennium Park and Michigan Ave . We will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ m staying here for business and I was blown away by my hotel room . It is gorgeous with top linen ##s and designer accent ##s . The view is amazing and I can ’ t believe all the little extra ##s they provide . From a N ##es ##press ##o machine to hire and toilet ##ries , I am very impressed ! I had dinner at the restaurant on the 20th floor and the view and food was great . If coming to Chicago , I ’ d highly recommend ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The property is in the center of the " Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , " walking distance from many attractions including Mill ##ennial Park , casual and fine restaurants , and hotel is beautiful ! Also , this is kid friendly hotel with a great pool for the kids and couple lanes for lap swimming . This a great hotel for couples get ##away or vacation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We checked in early and we were very happy . They did not have a king size bed . So we received 2 double beds we were ok with it . The room window did not close and the noise was very load as all weekend long there were concerts being held . The toilet also running but we report ##es to the con ##cier ##ge on exiting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was on the 11th floor and tried several times over an hour or so but no luck . I ended up having to go down to the lobby to get access . For what is basically a very nice hotel its really poor that they can ' t get their w ##if ##i working [SEP]
1	[CLS] Disc ##lai ##mer : I love Kim ##pton Hotels . I ' ve stayed at six altogether . I love how they each reflect the city they occupy . All ##egro Chicago is class ##y . What ' s not to like about night ##ly champagne social ##s ? We met so many people at those events . The rooms are large for a city such as Chicago . The temperature hovered around 0 ##° the six days we were in Chicago and it was a pleasure to return to the All ##egro . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely hotel , great location . We had three rooms as we were in Chicago for a wedding . The views from the rooms were amazing . Our room faced the Lake and Navy pier , really lovely at night . The rooms were spacious , we felt the bathroom ##s needed re ##f ##reshing . Room ##s were serviced well everyday . We did not have breakfast included instead we went to difference places for breakfast , which were walking distance from the hotel . We would use the hotel again as service was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] do not miss the opportunity to use the gold lounge services , simply outstanding . of particular help and service was a young lady named Man ##dan ##a ; she was a f ##ou ##nt of information for both my wife and i . whenever possible we pick a Fair ##mont , the service on all fronts is un ##su ##rp ##ass ##ed ; we travel extensively and it is difficult to find this kind of quality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to stay at the Palmer house for the first time , as we ’ ve stayed at many of the different hotels downtown , but were disappointed . We were so excited to stay here because of the good reviews and its reputation but after waiting an hour and a half after check in time to get our room , our card being charged 7 times , and the room we got where none of the power sources worked , we will never be back . The staff was very di ##sing ##en ##uous and slow . So so slow . It ’ s a shame , I would ’ ve loved to plan my wedding here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great staff and services . Front desk check in was fast and easy . Our room had a great view of the lake . The Columbus Ta ##p restaurant had items that fit for us for ca ##usal drinks and bites . Love ##d the Art ##ich ##oke . My girlfriend really enjoyed the sauce - less wings ! Will definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love my room to bed was very comfortable and so were the pillars ! I had an awesome view from my room looking over the city from Floor 34 . We didn ’ t bother the maid for service but If we had it would have been vacuum the carpet in areas that needed it and looking behind some of the furniture where there was water bottles left behind from previous stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first stay at a Conrad , and this one in Chicago , which is close to the Water Tower area , is a wonderful hotel . The staff are very friendly and pleasant . The rooms are very nice and feels like a luxury staff . I will stay here again when I ' m back in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We checked in this morning with a large group . Much to our surprise , our rooms were ready in the late morning and all of our key packets were assembled and handed out upon our arrival . Winner ! I got a corner room which was nice and large . Room was clean and very functional . My bed was rather comfortable . Bath ##room was good . Nice bath ##tub . Internet service was great throughout my stay . Super nice staff at the front . Warm sa ##lut ##ations each time that I passed . You couldn ' t ask for a better location . To ##ns of great stuff to see and do within arm ' s reach . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall the room was very good and the value for this hotel was great . The location was fantastic and the staff was friendly and helpful . The only issue was the room temperature , which was very , very warm . Fortunately we could open a window and make it more comfortable . I would definitely recommend a stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for marathon weekend and it was very crowded . Check - in was fine and room was nice . Very good location near many things in Chicago . Breakfast b ##uff ##et , although a little price ##y , was good . The con ##cier ##ge lounge at this property was very good and all the people working there were friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my second visit to the Ki ##nz ##ie , both for winter " stay ##cation ##s " in the city . This hotel is in a great location in River North , close to Michigan Ave . and tons of great restaurants . Their morning breakfast is so convenient , served right by the elevators on each floor . There ' s a nice basic variety of items , from m ##uff ##ins , bag ##els , cereal , yo ##gu ##rt , fruit and even hard - boiled eggs and string cheese . The three hour long evening happy hour could serve as dinner if you want , chips with sa ##ls ##a and g ##ua ##cam ##ole , an anti ##pas ##to tray , br ##us ##chet ##ta , pizza , cheer ##s and fruit . I ' ve heard that later on they put out sweet ##s . The w ##if ##i ( free ) in this hotel is the best I ' ve ever experienced . Room ##s are very clean and modern . I love the wall covered with a vintage map of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This beautiful hotel is located on Columbus Street , one block from three parks , two blocks from Michigan Avenue , and within walking distance to the Field Museum , the She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , the Adler Planet ##arium , the Art Institute , restaurants , and shopping .

1	[CLS] We booked this hotel at the last minute and what a pleasant surprise ! From the moment we arrived , the service was extraordinary . From the v ##alet who hurried out to help us with luggage to the front desk who offered us an upgrade for a modest fee , the entire staff was exceptional . We asked to have a refrigerator brought up , and it was there within 5 minutes of the request . We consulted the con ##cier ##ge several times for restaurant recommendations and directions and never had to wait . Anything we needed , someone stepped right in to take care of it . The bed was very comfortable and the gym was well equipped and clean . We will definitely return to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a few nights during a conference on floor 17 . A very big room with two double beds , very clean . Fine sized bathroom with a powerful shower although some shower gel would have been welcome . I didn ’ t eat in hotel but b ##urger place next door is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed this past weekend while watching the Chicago Marathon . We have stayed before and have always appreciated the convenient location to things like the architectural boat tours but now I can add great location for viewing the Chicago Marathon . The race starts very close to the hotel and you can see the runners as they cross the red carpet ##ed bridge just down the street from the hotel . Even in this crazy busy weekend the staff was exceptional . The post race crowd was a bit more than the restaurant could handle , so there was a bit of a wait , but under the circumstances , understand ##able . We had a junior suite that was outstanding . The lounge is very convenient and a welcome benefit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location . Staff was great . Unfortunately , with Co ##vid the bar and restaurant was not open . I certainly would stay again . Room was clean and spacious and w ##if ##i and t ##v worked great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay . All of the staff was fantastic . The room was very clean and comfortable . Room service was great . Our food was warm and quite good . We had dinner at Michael Jordan ##s in the hotel . The steak was the best we ' ve ever had . Service and am ##bian ##ce was perfect . The only complaint I had was the bed was pretty firm , and the fan was loud in the bedroom . Fortunately the te ##mp was moderate enough so that we just turned it off at night . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This review is going to be brief because as I type my com ##fy Conrad bed is pulling me in closer . : ) I arrived on Monday and have had the most pleasant stay . If you love new , clean and luxury - - this is the hotel for you . But more than this , the customer service is superb - always smiling faces and helpful hands by the guest services team . John even sent a team member off property to purchase as ##pi ##rin on my behalf when I was un ##p ##re ##par ##ed for a headache that came late this evening . So sweet ! Thank you , Conrad team . I ' ll definitely be back . [SEP]

Ernest in the executive lounge was the man ! Amazing customer service . The rooms were big and clean . Our ##s had two bathroom ##s which was cool ! The hotel was in a great location , walk - able to millennium park and right by many bus and rail stops . Will definitely be recommend ##ing this hotel for all that go to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador is an updated classic hotel with all the charm from when Frank Sinatra hung out in the famous P ##ump Room back in the day ( now Booth One ) . The location is by far the best of any hotel in Chicago . Oak Street Beach is 3 blocks away via walkway under Lake Shore Drive , the bars / restaurants on Division / Rush are a short 2 block walk , and the Red Line subway is 4 blocks . No cab / U ##ber needed when you stay here . Harry Cara ##y , the late / great Cubs announcer , lived at the Ambassador during baseball season and he became known as the Mayor of Rush Street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for one night during a work conference . Everyone was extremely nice . The room was lovely - though the view was a bit lacking . The shower was great ; everything was clean . The Ke ##uri ##g in the room was great ! The fitness room was good - though a bit small . The two free drinks in the bar was a great per ##k . I loved their house drink . W ##if ##i worked great . The con ##cier ##ge was very helpful . Really , I couldn ' t have asked for more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are clean and nicely re ##mo ##del ##ed . My room was pet ##ite and the closet was so interesting with all those features stuffed into a little spot . The staff was pre ##asa ##nt and we enjoyed the free pro ##ces ##cu ##o in the lobby in the afternoon . If you are a people watch ##er this is a great place to hang out for a while . Bar service was very quick and very pleasant . We ordered a collection of drinks which were all prepared correctly . Due to the weather , we didn ' t try out the offer of the rental bike . If you visit ; you might want to take up the offer of a bike ride around town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]

1	[CLS] A couple friends and I last minute needed to stay overnight in the Chicago ##land area due to the snow coming in and this hotel was our first choice . The building is just as beautiful on the inside as the outside . All staff was very at ##ten ##tive and helpful . Our room was truly a pleasant surprise . Dec ##ent size living area and bed room . Our mini kitchen area became our favorite spot next to the extra large and comfortable bed . De ##fin ##ite ##ly looking forward to going back and staying here ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 7 nights - had booked a double room , but were immediately offered a free upgrade to a suite as we were there for a longer time . Every member of the team that we met were so approach ##able , friendly and welcoming , made us feel like family ! The food in the bar was also delicious ( and surprisingly affordable considering the area ! ) plus the $ 10 dollar off for going en ##vir ##o - friendly was an amazing bonus ! Couldn ’ t fault it at all ! Such a wonderful stay - if I ’ m ever back in Chicago , will certainly be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Time in the wind ##y city , was not wind ##y but still cold . However , the river became green and the people all came out to have a good time . Lots to see and many places to eat and drink . St . Patrick Day is special in this city , must put it on your bucket list . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a quick weekend trip to Chicago . The check - in process was quick and easy and they were able to get us a very early check - in . The hotel was within walking distance ( a few blocks ) from La ##S ##alle St . train station . The hotel is about a mile from the main downtown shopping district , but it ' s walk ##able . The pool and hot tub was very nice . The rooms was smaller , but nice . There ' s a lot of neat history with this hotel so be sure to read about it while you ' re here ! Will definitely stay here again . It was also a fraction of the cost of staying directly in the downtown shopping district . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The front desk service was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! the elevator went down and it was very slow backed up I understand that problems happen ! I didn ' t like the fact that you needed a key to get up the elevator when you have company coming you need to meet him downstairs [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able large suite . Very clean . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary morning drinks . Nice pool and gym . Great central location - able to walk to all the sights and just off the magnificent mile for shopping and restaurants . Very safe area . Only draw ##back was room not ready for check - in time and front desk staff br ##us ##que . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed it . After being disappointed with our very tiny room after check ##in , we were immediately moved to a more spacious room with no hesitation from the hotel staff . We appreciated the breakfast and social hour and found the hotel to be clean and comfortable . It ' s location cannot be beat . Gerry , the con ##cier ##ge , is a true asset to the hotel and was very helpful and friendly . Can ' t wait to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Except ##ional value and pleasant am ##bie ##nce . Great value for the location , from the price of the rooms to the price of the items in the mini ##bar . We especially liked the feel of the Library , where we could sit by the fire and have a nice glass of wine . [SEP]

It ' s a beautiful hotel with a comfortable sitting area downstairs . The room we had was outstanding , with an amazing beautiful view of the lake . We were very happy with everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay ! Just the perfect hotel to explore the city . Quiet and offers free drinks and a delicious compliment ##ary b ##uff ##et everyday . Very friendly staff . Really nothing to complain about . The rooms are spacious and have HBO channels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] El ##egan ##t , Clean , Help ##ful Staff , Quiet and a great breakfast menu ! Love ##d the bathroom ! Problems with the room were dealt with quickly and court ##eous ##ly . No complaints about the So ##fit ##el Chicago . Central ##ly located to all we wanted to do in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Be treated like family with excellent accommodation ##s in the Rush Street area ! I only stay at the Talbot ##t when I travel to Chicago for business or pleasure ! Walking distance to Rush , Michigan and great dining options . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Room ##s were fine but service was not . They do not provide the basic toilet ##ries which is f ##rust ##rating after paying so much for a room . The walls are paper thin - even the water running through the pipes every time someone in the rooms next to me was loud enough to wake me from my sleep multiple times . So much for getting a good night ' s rest . It almost sounded as if there were no walls ( even though they ad ##vert ##ise sound proof walls in my room ) . The food was average at best . The hotel itself is older and out ##dated . I wouldn ' t stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was totally impressed with the Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco during my first stay there . Though we arrived early , they had a clean , comfortable room ready for us , complete with a window seat facing the Chicago River . I can ’ t speak highly enough of the staff , everyone of them I interact ##ed with were uniform ##ly pleasant . While I needed assistance to figure out how to access the W ##i - Fi ( it ’ s free for I ##H ##G members ) , the signal was fast and strong . The room was spacious and bed were comfortable and I enjoyed the compliment ##ary morning coffee in the lobby . For the price ( $ 149 for 2 queen bed and overnight parking ) , it was best lo ##dging values I experienced in Chicago in recent memory . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie hotel exceed my expectations , from checking in with a wonderful staff member . To having drinks with Josh , he was so friendly & knowledge ##able about great places to check out in Chicago . This was a family Christmas trip & we had the best Christmas @ the kin ##zie . Spencer had a list of restaurants that were open on Christmas Day , this list was so essential as ye ##l ##p was no help . If you plan on staying here just know that you will be in the heart of it all ! ! ! I hope to come back soon , we loved our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ambassador and wasn ’ t disappointed . Room was great and well designed and styled . One Booth ( Bar / restaurant ) at the hotel is off the hook . Great food and great cocktail ##s ( coming back for the Burt Reynolds ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I tend to stay at O ##m ##ni properties in major cities when traveling and typically I get a great deal on room pricing as an O ##m ##ni member . This time around I got a better deal through a travel website connected th ##ru T ##A that the hotel couldn ’ t match . Price ##s O ##m ##ni offered on the same room was much higher . . . oh well . As usual , the staff at this O ##m ##ni was ex ##em ##p ##lary . I found our room clean and overly spacious for a standard room . Bar and restaurant on 4th floor were excellent and is central ##ly located in downtown Chicago . This hotel does lack the classic charm of their other properties ( Boston , Pittsburgh ) but makes up for it in other areas . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Happy to report since my visit in December the hotel room renovations made all the difference . Much more up to the Fair ##mont standards . Thank you ! I must admit , I ’ m not a fan of Columbus Ta ##p , the restaurant in the hotel . Don ’ t really care for the menu . Also nowhere to eat breakfast that I could find in the hotel , luck ##ily a number of f ##abulous choices nearby . My room was near the elevator bank , I could annoying ##ly hear the up and down of the elevators all hours of the day and night . The staff that is not overly helpful . The property itself is a nice place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a wonderful week staying here . Not one complaint . Staff friendly and helpful . Meeting set ups and meals exceptional . Bed comfortable and te ##mp c ##rank ##ed down to 60 degrees for good night ' s sleep . Lots of room with the suite set up . Would stay here again when in Chicago again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter booked this for a mother - daughter weekend trip and we through ##ly enjoyed this wonderful hotel and it ’ s location . The location is perfect to all the best stores in Chicago , and we were able to walk and shop to our hearts delight ! Our double room was spacious and comfortable and the bathroom was clean and updated . The bar area offered comfortable and co ##zy seating with great service and the small restaurant was convenient to grab a quick breakfast before shopping . Will definitely return to this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is beyond incredible . The lobby is on floor 20 which was a little different , but the place is beautiful and clean . Staff went above and beyond to ensure that all our needs were met . We were surprised with a bottle of champagne and chocolate ##s in our room to help us celebrate . The robes were so comfortable that we are going to try to purchase some for Home . You can ask for anything you need via text . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] B ##ES ##T PA ##RT : They offer v ##alet parking and the attendant , Sa ##rge , was so awesome ! ! ! He is De ##af but that didn ' t stop him from providing G ##RE ##AT service . I know AS ##L , my family doesn ' t but he made sure to communicate with all of us ! My family and I would always stop and talk with him on our way in / out and he was very helpful with directions and always had a smile on his face . He went above and beyond his job requirement . If my family visits again , he will be the reason I return to this Home ##wood . This hotel offers a great location ! Breakfast was good and the workers there were at ##ten ##tive . Down ##fall is is that it only has two elevators . We stayed on the 19th floor so it was a little da ##unting waiting for the elevator . [SEP]

0	[CLS] The rooms here are absolutely huge ! Of course the hotel is beautiful , has a fantastic location & a great staff , but I was really impressed by our suite . The hotel also has an indoor pool which is nice as Chicago weather isn ' t always a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to outdoor swimming . I wouldn ' t hesitate to stay again . The only down ##side is the parking , but it ' s expected in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a good stay at She ##rato ##n Grand for a training . Good property with good amenities . Friendly staff as well as clean rooms . Hotel proximity to most of the attractions . To ##ns of restaurant options within walking distance of the property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location was great - close to a lot of shopping , restaurants , bars , etc . Our room wasn ##t serviced although we asked the housekeeper to come back in an hour when we would be gone . Our room number was given out when someone used my name - security or guest information is lacking . Check in an Check out was fairly quick . Bell staff were awesome . con ##cier ##ge was great with restaurant recommendations when needed and with making reservations for us . Over all it was a decent stay , i can ##t say i would stay there again due to the big parts they were lacking in ( room se ##r ##vic ##ing and giving out guest room # ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great room with river view and co ##zy reading no ##ok overlooking view . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds , well appointed room , signature leopard print robes . Pro ##mpt room service , grab and go . Wine happy hour . Super location in the Loop [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good value with mild concerns at check ##out . Stay ##ed for the Cubs convention . Pretty nice room . Bath ##room could benefit from mild updates — paint . No attendant at Bell Stand when we tried to check out and had to reach over to desk to call someone . Still was 5 - 10 min more . Our luggage was locked in a room so we had to wait . Bed and room itself was comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n brand has some of the most comfortable beds I ' ve stayed In . The Chicago location did not let me down it ! I was very please with the river view room . The lobby was very well kept . I loved the Star ##bu ##cks brand coffee in the room , very nice touch [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the distinct pleasure of staying at the Palmer House through the Christmas Holiday season and the attention to detail and decorations ad ##orn ##ing the hotel were f ##estive and bright ! It put me into the holiday spirit of fun and good cheer . The old hotel had a feeling of celebration from years gone by with a dash of Chicago gangster added in for no ##stal ##gia . It was a real pleasure to stay there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fair ##mont ' s Gold program is an excellent way to enjoy luxurious " home - away - from home " comfort . The attention to detail is evident from the moment you walk in the door and follows you wherever you go . . . lobby , room , hallway ##s , and , in particular , the Gold Lounge . Excellent service and accommodation ##s on all counts ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very happy staying here . Bed ##s are way comfortable and great view of the river . Staff was very helpful and the members lounge was spacious . Fitness room was also well appointed . Food as a whole was good as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is S ##O NO ##T the Fair ##mont you have become accustomed to ! S ##hab ##by hotel / rooms , T ##ER ##RI ##BL ##E service and zero communication between each and every department . Had to ask 3 - 4 ##x ' s per day to get something done . There were 3 people who were helpful and worth sing ##ling out ( Alexander , Jennifer and John at the front desk ) . If you come expecting a Holiday Inn type service experience , you won ' t be disappointed ( no offense to Holiday Inn ) . We ordered breakfast the 1st morning during our 5 day stay - there was a hair baked into a chocolate c ##rois ##san ##t . NO ONE - not the food / beverage manager , not the hotel manager , no one - called us about this . In fact , we had to get them to remove the meal from our bill at the end of the stay . Un ##believable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t to Chicago for a girls trip and this was in the perfect location to walk to shopping and the park and museums . You communicate with the front desk via text , there ’ s a nice happy hour on the 6th floor every night , and there ’ s a great breakfast put out for the floor every morning . The rooms are a little on the small size , but have queen size beds . For some reason we were put into a wheelchair accessible room so the bathroom was basically a wet room with a stand - alone sink ( no counter ##top ) . That would have been great for the person who needed those amenities ; they just weren ’ t required by us . Overall a very nice hotel and would stay there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We love this iconic Chicago hotel and have seen its transformation over the decades and app ##lau ##d its success . The best way to start any evening is drinks in the p ##ala ##tial lobby area that atmosphere a f ##estive ##ness and history is truly special . And our room was quiet - that truly matters ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came to town to watch a play that my cousin wrote at a nearby theatre . Cho ##se the hotel at the last minute , and glad we ended up with it . The staff was fantastic , the hotel was very bout ##ique - y - which we love . It was a sweet stay . < 3 [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a woman any visit to Chicago has to include some shopping time . This hotel has a perfect location for it as it is situated right in the center of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The hotel has an art de ##co feeling , from its furnishings to its lamps . Nice long lobby and good rooms . I was first given a room on the 14th floor , nice and spacious but looking at the windows from the adjacent building so I asked to be moved . They gave me another room on the 12th ##s floor with much better view although slightly smaller . The rooms are spacious with a separate sitting area and desk . The bathroom ##s spacious . The overall feeling of the property is comfortable and clean . I will definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time at the Hotel Monaco and it was a great choice ! Our granddaughter ##s thought it was " beautiful " , and it was . They used the two window seats with the curtains drawn for privacy to read , check their phones , and apply makeup . The view from there was wonderful , as well . The hotel staff was exceptionally court ##eous and helpful . The best feature of the hotel , however , is the location . You can ' t beat it if you ' re sights ##ee ##ing in Chicago . Across from the Trump Tower , it ' s a close to everything we wanted to do . I highly recommend Hotel . Monaco . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Usually when my wife and I travel we look for a good deal in a good location when we pick a hotel . We travel to Chicago fairly frequently and this is the first time we have come back to the same hotel because we loved our stay here last time . The staff is friendly , the location can ’ t be beat , the de ##cor is lovely , the price is moderate and you can ’ t beat the compliment ##ary wine service every night at 5 pm ! What more need I say ? We ’ ll be back next time we come to Chicago also ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nice location , friendly staff , but to me , bed ##ding was uncomfortable . House ##keeping would keep on calling to see if I needed room to be cleaned even though I had do not disturb sign on door . That became i ##rri ##tating due to the fact that I was sleeping [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Fair ##mont for a conference in October . The event staff went above and beyond to help make the experience a good one . The location is great and the building is very clean . The only issue is that for large events , the elevators are slow and many are not in service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our hotel experience was excellent , beginning with the con ##cier ##ge greeting us at the front door , the stream ##lined check - in service , the clean ##liness of our room , the house ##keeping service , the excellent steak ##s at the St ##ets ##on restaurant , the massive slice of compliment ##ary chocolate cake presented for our anniversary after our meal , the helpful ##ness of the con ##cier ##ge with directions and taxi service as we came and went several times from the hotel , the temperature control of our room , the comfortable bed , all the way to the ease of check - out when it was time for us to leave . The convenience to downtown attractions and the Union Station was perfect . Our only disappointment ( minor as it is ) was the lack of shelf space for our toilet ##ries in the spacious bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the hotel because it was part of a conference block - but unexpectedly had the most wonderful daily AM interactions with Ms Man ##dan ##a who staff ##s the 15th floor “ Gold Lounge ” for breakfast . Not only was the daily food selection and atmosphere wonderful - the experience is ex ##po ##nent ##ially better due to Man ##dan ##a ’ s cheerful greeting and outstanding service . She learned my name and coffee preference after the first day and therefore made my week each morning with her very sweet disposition and smile . I will definitely return to the hotel - her service and personality would make it worth it even if I am not getting a conference block rate ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d my stay here ! Staff was super friendly and welcoming ! Hotel was in a G ##RE ##AT location . Wish the room had a fridge and microwave but they brought one up for us so it was awesome ! The staff was great and the restaurant was delicious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in a perfect location . We booked the day of travel and got a great deal . A ##rri ##val was sea ##m ##less - - we left our car with the v ##alet , checked in , and grabbed a compliment ##ary glass of wine that is served daily during happy hour . The rooms are attractive with all the amenities either available or upon request . The staff , from the front desk to v ##alet , are very friendly and helpful . Just a caution that the hotel is dog - friendly , and there were quite a few dogs around . We didn ' t experience any problems with noise but my parents ended up switching rooms due to a barking dog . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You can ’ t fault it for location , beside the lake , at top of Michigan a ##ve Perfect for shopping or chill ##ing by the beach / lake Some rooms have lake views I had the breakfast there and it was average and very heavy and s ##to ##d ##gy The service was hit and miss , they weren ’ t at all busy but I felt a bit of an in ##con ##ven ##ience because I sat myself in a corner as I like to have a quiet spot Room ##s are dark , small but not cramped Old fashioned and no bath The reception ##ist [SEP]
1	[CLS] We traveled with our kids to stay here with family for the weekend . The rooms are great for families , as they are all suites . The kids loved the pool . The food was really well done . Room ##s could use a re ##no , but are on the whole pretty good . Staff could not have been nice ##r . A great value for families . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room here was clean and comfortable , with an awesome view over the River toward the W ##rig ##ley Building . Love ##d sending p ##ics of the view back home . Otherwise found the hotel to be a massive , generic be ##hem ##oth . Stay ##ed here as I had a conference rate , but wish I had stayed at the smaller and more persona ##ble Virgin where I ended up over the weekend after my meetings were done . [SEP]
1	[CLS] AC system ran hot / cold . TV worked intermittent ##ly . Who wants to call house ##keeping at 10 pm because the t ##v won ’ t turn on ? Bed was too firm . Pi ##llow ##s were too firm . A bit sad property at a great location . Use U ##ber and save a fortune on Vale ##t . Should ##n ’ t be an average room at these prices . [SEP]
0	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt Regency offers an amazing location to just about everything in Chicago . The automatic check - in / check - out process was excellent . I received an email that I can check - in online ; I mentioned when I arrived and then soon I received another email letting me know my room was ready . And using a Q ##R code , I went to a self - serving k ##ios ##k and printed my room key . F ##law ##less design , and it worked great . Same for check - out . No line , no has ##sle . Be aware that some of the rooms have paper - thin walls , and it can be quite distract ##ing if one is on business trip and needs to work while in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] outstanding trip for mom ##ma and me . Great location just off the Mile , and a wonderful q ##ua ##int little neighborhood . Staff was court ##eous and our room was big and comfortable . Food and am ##bian ##ce at 20 ##E was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing customer service , amazing room , room service was fast every single time . I was upgraded to a suite free of charge ! I will definitely recommend this to all my fellow pan ##dor ##a employees as we travel to ch ##ica ##go for business al ##ot [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suite was very good lounge room table was a we ##e bit damaged otherwise very nice . The breakfast and evening social which we did not know about before we arrived was great . The staff were very friendly . The location perfect for our city break . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the O ##m ##ni was extremely at ##ten ##tive ! ! ! From v ##alet , the bell ##man that gave my four - year - old a bag of good ##ies , the welcoming front desk staff , to room service that served my daughter pan ##cakes with s ##p ##rin ##kles and whipped cream . . . the service was awesome ! The room was clean , s ##ty ##lish , and well maintained ! Great location ! ! ! I ’ ll be back ! Great for the whole family ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are dated and sheet rock is falling off the walls . You can tell them only pay attention to the lobby and the ballroom ##s . Also , bring a USB adapt ##er because they won ' t have one in the room . Don ' t be fool ##ed by the name " Hilton . " You can get a better value elsewhere . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was there to visit my family before a long v ##oc ##ation that I will be away for the next 3 months . The Ki ##nz ##ie hotel has what you need to be a good to hotel to stay . Great service , very nice room and not lonely at all just spend few drink in the bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a nice location . I have stayed here before on business . The staff is friendly and helpful . Some of the rooms probably need up ##dating . Overall the hotel is well maintained . The location is ideal for conferences and doing business in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , near plenty places to eat and places to visit . Walking distance to Grant park , Field Museum , Ma ##ggy Dale ##y Park , A ##qua ##rium , Observatory , Lake Michigan , River Walk and you can walk to the Bean , Buckingham fountain , and Art Institute of Chicago . We had a corner room with two queen beds , two baths and two refrigerator ##s . Unfortunately , there was no microwave . The beds are com ##fy and the bathroom ##s are nice . The staff is very helpful and we definitely enjoyed our out ##ing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While the room was nice , I felt ni ##ckle and dim ##ed for everything . Ice is only on the 23rd and 8th floors , which was not convenient when the elevators are extremely slow . I was charged for drinks in the room cause they were moved off their sensors for over 30 seconds . I just felt disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything was perfect in this hotel , the room was amazing , the view , the local ##ization and the service . The personal that work there is very nice , all the time they were able to assist us with ever ##uth ##ing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed our stay here , E ##VA fantastic , Very welcoming , very friendly , she helped us out on so many levels and our stay was amazing . She is an outstanding representative for the hotel and will be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was great and the ability to communicate with them via Text Me ##ssa ##ging was unique . The Palm restaurant experience was remarkable , which is uncommon for hotels . The lunch comb ##o was excellent and a great value on price , especially for Chicago . I would highly recommend visiting the Palm , even if you were not staying at the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is awesome when it comes to comfort and convenience . It has some great views of Chicago and is central ##ly located in the downtown area . The hotel staff was great and very at ##ten ##tive . We attended both bar areas on 2 separate nights and were given poor customer service . The 1st night the staff seemed angry that we had such a large group . They didn ' t appreciate our business . This was the rooftop lounge . The 2nd night , the waitress literally threw a menu at us . When we talked to the manager about it , he didn ' t seem to care about our concern . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone we encountered was tremendous . All special requests and needs were answered swiftly , professionally , friendly , and completely . F ##ac ##ilities small but comfortable . Room ##s large , clean and inviting . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Love ##d this hotel ! The room was amazing . The bed was comfortable and clean . I ordered breakfast for the next morning and it was DE ##L ##IC ##IO ##US ! ! ! The shower was awesome and they had full size s ##ham ##po ##os , condition ##er , etc . I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to my friends [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone was friendly and the room was a good size . Great location to walk to the aquarium and the Field Museum . For breakfast go to Yo ##lk about 3 blocks south - G ##RE ##AT food ! The pool was cold and cloud ##y which was a b ##um ##mer because that was part of the reason we chose this hotel for our young girls . Overall a great stay though and we would definitely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dolores from the 15th floor was amazing ! ! ! She was very nice and provided great service . She went above and beyond to make us comfortable . We would highly recommend the Fair ##mont . The location is great and the service exceptional . Thank you [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone at the Ki ##nz ##ie was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and extra at ##ten ##tive to us and our guests . Hotel is central ##ly located to many restaurants and bars . Would definitely recommend staying here and we can ##ny wait to come back [SEP]
0	[CLS] They H ##ya ##tt Regency Hotel is a nice hotel . The staff , clean ##liness and location of the hotel is what makes it great . The rooms are very clean and well maintained . The guest room de ##cor could use an update in the near future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There were hairs all over bathroom . The rug was dirty and not vacuum ##ed . Spider web ##s on windows . There was blood on pillow ##case . Room was noisy from train . Hall ##ways are loud . Very slow check in process . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Historic Hotel in Gold Coast Area . Great , repeat great Lo ##bby Piano Bar . Nice Architecture , generally well kept . Friendly staff . Small ##ish but well appointed room . Downs ##ide ? No ##is ##y . Lou ##dly and clearly heard neighbors TV , among other things . We kept our voices hushed to avoid potentially disturbing our neighbors . Bottom line is we got a super rate . But wouldn ' t stay again due to the noise . You don ' t have to be a guest to use the Bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel with very professional staff located in the heart of Chicago . Walking distance of pretty much all the good places in Chicago . As in most downtown hotels , they don ' t offer parking for a reasonable price , actually it costs 42 USD / day . What I recommend , traveling to Chicago by train , airplane or bus and move around either by walking or using U ##ber / L ##y ##ft . The most expensive U ##ber I paid was 10 $ pretty much because everything is very close . Room ##s are classic style and so are the elevators . Internet is not free but the internet connection is of quite acceptable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] 20 years ago this was one of the best hotels in my opinion in Chicago . I had not been there in so many years . I figured it would have been re ##mo ##del ##ed a couple of times since my last stay . Ah NO . We checked in at 3 : 45 ##pm . Unfortunately the room was not ready . Being a President Club member I would have thought my room would have been ready . Nope , and the front desk person didn ’ t know when it would be . The furniture , beds , TV ##s and rooms need an update . They are old and worn . We had booked 2 nights here and after one night we decided to check out . I seek out and really enjoy staying at Fair ##mont Hotels all over the world . I will not be back to the Chicago property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having stumbled on the Talbot ##t a couple of years ago , it ' s now our go - to place in Chicago . During summer or winter the welcome is warm , the rooms have everything you need , and the restaurant and bar has a great and buzzing atmosphere . The staff are always willing to help whether it be the reception , con ##cier ##ge or room - team . The gym is small but adequate , and it ' s a short walk to some of the best shops , bars restaurants in Chicago - a shop ##per ' s paradise . Also just a short walk to the lake with lots to do in between . Great value for money - I don ' t plan to stay anywhere else in Chicago except the Talbot ##t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an Old School Style Hotel in a central location , well within walking distance to the Park and many of the sight seeing locations . The staff is extremely helpful and a pleasure to deal with , see Debbie at the con ##cier ##ge desk for any advice on the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good central location and a nice entrance and lobby . Unfortunately I saw several negative points : - house ##keeping was on strike ( which is completely their right ) but they didn ##t offer any kind of compensation for that . - due to the strike the bar sa ##s closed too : / - nobody to carry our luggage to the lobby on the 1 . Floor by arrival or to indicate the elevators - they gave us first a very small room with almost no daylight . After complaining we got a bigger room ( still small for the price we paid ) - we had to pay on top for the w ##if ##i . In a hotel of this standard this should really be integrated . So a di ##sa ##point ##ing stay in this well located hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first stay and from the moment my cab arrived the staff were delight ##ful . Every single individual I interact ##ed with was friendly , court ##eous and paused to interact with me . It has been a long time since I ’ ve experienced such warm service . The room was clean and functional . Se ##cure elevator service . Bath tub . E ##ff ##icient room service that exceeded my expectations . I will stay again for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t in Chicago was a great place for our family to stay for our trip to watch to the Chicago Cubs play ball . We wanted to be near Michigan Avenue so that we could walk around the heart of downtown , but it ' s a very simple walk to the CT ##A red line " L " train . The hotel restaurant is more of an app ##eti ##zer / o ' do ##ur ##ves menu with a solid drink selection . The door ##man ( David ) was extremely nice and helpful along with the con ##cier ##ge staff and bell ##man crew . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is such a great property . The entire process from checking in to checking out was incredibly smooth . The staff here is well trained and graceful , the suites are outstanding and the location could not be better . Since the hotel was located right on Ma ##g Mile , I was able to walk to the river , Grant Park , Navy Pier and so many other places . I definitely recommend staying here and I ' m looking forward to returning the next time I vacation in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great experience staying at a room under the Fair ##mont Gold program this past weekend . The food was great and really appreciated the help with planning our activities from Mu ##gi and T ##ip ##hani ! From booking activities to dinner reservations before our show , they do it all ##l ! Their con ##cier ##ge service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble all with a smile on their faces ! Have great memories of Chicago thanks largely to their friendly manner while offering great service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel does a great job of making you feel welcome from the moment you first arrive . The elevator is a little hard to get used to as you must use your key card to get it to operate . However I appreciate the security . They serve c ##rois ##san ##ts and chocolate filled past ##ries complementary in the morning until 7 . No one at the hotel told us about it but I had read about it on trip ##ad ##visor . They also had apples , tea and coffee in the restaurant . I also made use of their business center to print some documents . The room was a great value and I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wait ##ed 4 hours past check - in to get into our 2nd room . We were told there was only one housekeeper for the 26th floor ! After several requests to speak to a manager none came . The associate suddenly had our room ready . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very central ##ly locate ##s to all the downtown tourist attractions , we walked everywhere , even with young kids . Right on the River ##walk , next to Millennium park , navy pier , and eat ##eries . Bo ##ught Group ##ons for an architecture boat tour ( highly recommended ) which was right down the block . The 2 rooms were modern with a great view . However , house ##keeping was not great , either no toilet ##ries , no towels , and even took the garbage can and didn ’ t bring it back . We would be out all day , and come back to rooms not yet cleaned , and have to wait in the lobby for another 20 min . And still , we ’ d have to call back down for towels etc . [SEP]

We had no idea , so I told him to pick for us . He gave us a corner room with lake and river views as well as Navy Pier . It was beautiful ! The rest of the staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting all weekend and our stay couldn ’ t have been better . [SEP]

As a Kim ##pton rewards member ( it ' s free ) , I also received a gift card for $ 10 off items from the mini - bar and free wireless .

0	[CLS] I was in Chicago for business and stayed in Hilton Chicago , the front desk staff Cars ##arra was very nice and helpful . She made me feel good to stay in Hilton Chicago .

0	[CLS] I have stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in Chicago several times for nearby business meetings . I have always found it to be very pleasant , and the staff very professional . On my recent trip , I stayed for several days and walked around a lot . I found it to be within walking distance of everything I wanted to see . Great location , and a really nice hotel . The Ki ##nz ##ie also has a morning breakfast and evening cocktail reception for customers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I traveled from Iowa to attend the German Christmas market that I ' m too lazy to go look up . The Palmer House was perfect for us . Historic hotel with a great staff . Everyone very helpful . We stayed on the 23rd floor which is restricted along with the 22nd . It was worth the money to upgrade . We loved the history of the place . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great bout ##ique hotel , very clean rooms , very convenient for walking to river walk . Easy location for bus or metro transport to all other areas . Never tried breakfast as there are so many great breakfast places in easy walking distance including the Wild ##berry cafe . Coffee service in the morning , my only grip ##e would be 6 ##US ##D bottle ##d water in the rooms although they do have fl ##av ##our ##ed water available all day in reception . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The first person we met was the bell ##man , Charles , who was so kind , friendly and helpful . His enthusiasm and warm smile were a welcome sight every time we arrived at the hotel .

The room and entire hotel property was clean and very well appointed . All amenities are available and we enjoyed dining in the restaurant . Great location and value ! We will stay there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Tri ##ed to over charge me almost double . Didn ’ t clean room one day . Keeping rooms comfortable te ##mp was impossible , parking rates ridiculous , food b ##land & same stuff over & over . No ice machines on any floors [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel right on the magnificent mile . Check in desk is on 3rd floor like many Chicago hotels which is less than desirable but hotel makes up for it . Clean spacious rooms . Small ##ish pool and gym . Great location and staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After a 3 hour delay in my room being ready , didn ’ t get the keys until 6 : 30 ##pm , staff wanted to charge hotels because of a smoke smell . Vale ##t took 50 minutes for my car . Service was so bad the entire stay and all meals were free and still a f ##rust ##rating experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was amazing . Bed ##s are very small ( double ) bathroom definitely needed some up ##dating . The b ##urger place was closed every time we tried to go . Location great . Star ##bu ##cks on - site . Lots of stores close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco is B ##ES ##T ! The location , the staff , the service and the de ##cor is awesome . Pay a little extra and get a room with a river view , you won ' t be Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed ! ! Too ##k the kids to see the sights and take a bus tour . Walking to grant park and Maggie Dale ##y was easy from Monaco [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived really early so our rooms weren ’ t ready yet . The bell ##men took our stuff and held it for us until we could check in . We got a text from hotel when they were ready for us . I thought that was cool . The room was nice and i had a great view of the river . The lobby is beautiful . The only reason i didn ’ t give it a 5 rating was because nowhere on my reservation or when i was checking in was i told of a $ 20 a night resort fee . I saw it later in the packet she gave me upon check in . For that price you ’ d think the rooms could have compliment ##ary water or something . The water in the room was $ 8 . But they had free water in the lobby . Other then that the stay was perfect . All of the staff i encountered were really great too ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] There are great Hotels in Chi - Town and the H ##ya ##tt . Location , service , accommodation ##s . . . just perfect . This last time it was not different and had a perfect stay . I had several requests and Tiffany made them all possible without a flinch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Di ##sa ##point ##ing stay : the hotel is great , well located , but the room was too noisy : air co that could not be switched off and that was so loud that I could not sleep for 4 nights . also could hear noise from other rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a Hilton Diamond member and I spend 100 nights per year in hotels . I was extremely disappointed with this hotel . It was a terrible value for the price . The room was V ##ER ##Y tiny . I was not given a Diamond upgrade ( again ) ! I was on a low floor . The traffic noise was terrible . There are no bath ##tub ##s . There is no pool . It is a real b ##um ##mer to spend a fortune to be a Diamond and not be rewarded for the loyalty . Breakfast now consists of $ 15 per person and that only buys your juice . The room was not worth the price and that is the bottom line . I felt like I was totally ripped off . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We attended a wedding at the Palmer House and stayed for a long weekend . Great venue for a beautiful wedding . The staff was over the top helpful . We were upgraded to the Executive floor on arrival and that proved to be a good move as breakfast and evening app ##eti ##zers were included . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Had a quick one night stay over in Chicago . This is my third trip that I have stayed at this location and always enjoy myself . Only downfall is the elevators are a bit slow , but the staff more than make up for it . Staff in the Evening Social and Breakfast area are amazing , always look forward to speaking with them . The food selection is always great as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family of four stayed two nights at the She ##rato ##n Grand . The location was great and within walking distance to Michigan Ave and Navy Pier . The room on the other hand was just ok . It was clean , but not well maintained . The bathroom door handle fell off , the tub s ##po ##ut shook when water was turned on , ceiling tiles were broken . Most of the staff we encountered was friendly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The lobby is really nice , letting you revive the 1920 ' s atmosphere . Unfortunately , the room we had was a bit smaller as expected , in particular with respect to the hotel ' s category . Co ##mple ##mentary coffee in the morning and champagne in the evenings are a very nice offer . Take the occasion to enjoy the lobby ' s atmosphere [SEP]
1	[CLS] Couldn ' t ask for a better location and I was lucky enough to have a great view . It is clean and all staff are friendly and helpful . But . . . it ' s needs up ##dating . It just feels old and dated and at these rates , I expect more . The bathroom was way small and the bed was too firm but we overcome by adding more pillows . I ' d stay again but only on the company dim ##e . I wouldn ' t spend my own money here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 4 day stay K ##wa ##hm ##e welcomed us efficient room with a view close to Water Tower , beach , Macy Crystal ballroom makes for a great venue . No room service but that didn ' t bother us . A / c good elevators quick for an old girl like this . Cap ##ones old s ##tom ##ping grounds , previously owned by Playboy on Hugh He ##f ##ner Way , super su ##shi around the corner Ma ##sai Su ##shi , the Local good for comfort food . Great bed and shower . Perfect for the two of us Old Boom ##ers . [SEP]

Great surprise . Very clean , spacious and great amenities in a room . Unfortunately limited view from my room , but some of my cow ##or ##kers got a nice lake view . We had lunch during our meeting and found their food was also super good . They set up Mexican b ##uff ##et for lunch one day . Everything was super good . So as servers .

1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 days to attend a wedding which was organized in the hotel itself . Its a big hotel and location is so prime . All the activities are organized so well that even co ##z of huge crowd it looked well planned and organized . Food was very ta ##sty , wedding and dinner hall decorated so beautiful . Its gym room and Pool was also good . Only thing just because of huge rush check - in time took too long . we asked for early - check in but even then we got room at 3 . 30 pm . But overall experience was good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ron , who I believe manages the front desk , checked us in and we were delighted to find that we had been upgraded to an amazing room with awesome window seats and views of the river .

0	[CLS] I wouldn ’ t recommend this hotel to anyone . Our experience was awful ! The room was not as advertised , the toilet didn ’ t flush properly , the sink continued to have standing water and we found several bugs that we had to kill . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice room spacious except our room smelled like cigarette smoke but they changed our room . Nice space and layout . F ##abulous l ##ica ##ti ##9 ##n near great shopping and plenty of restaurants . The v ##alet parking very expensive $ 70 a day [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is really great , and great value for money . The rooms are a bit on the small side but , very clean and nice and with a great view . The location is perfect for shops and restaurants . A great hotel for a weekend trip to ch ##ica ##go ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ing at this hotel for a business conference could not be worse . I had to stay in a room with a few other people and hey only provided two towels and when we asked for more it took them over two hours . The lady on the phone was very very rude , my roommate ##s and I felt very un ##sat ##is ##fe ##d with our stay and would not recommend to anyone visiting Chicago [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved this hotel so clean it was spot ##less The staff so friendly and I miss the chocolate chip cookies freshly made every other day I had a ##g ##rea ##t time for 6 good days . the room was big enough for us to move around without feeling it small and bright color walls and bed ##ding mad it feel larger [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 10 nights and really couldn ' t find anything to fault the place on . Nice staff at desk , room was im ##ma ##culate and recently refurbished . Nice terrace bit by the river . Very pleasant ##ly surprised given the hotel isn ' t a new hotel . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed in many of the Michigan Avenue / Loop hotels and this is a really good one . We could hear ambulance sire ##ns due to the proximity of the hospital , but they didn ' t keep us up at night . The biggest draw ##back was the price of v ##alet parking - and the amount of time that it took to retrieve the car . But we are going to check this hotel first on our next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I just stayed here for five nights and really loved it . First of all , the location is perfect for exploring The Loop and some surrounding neighborhoods . A walk or short U ##ber ride gets you to most of the " must see " places . Next , I really like the room d ##é ##cor , its not your usual b ##land be ##ige hotel room , instead there is lots of color . Finally , the staff was so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Michael , one of the door ##men , was so helpful in giving directions . And the evening wine reception just puts this place over the top . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only 2 blocks from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , this hotel provides a sense of quiet ##ness and relax . Well designed rooms with very good service . The terrace is just wonderful in June . And restaurant is over the average . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The only complaint I have is that I was not notified in advance of the $ 50 per day incident ##als deposit . Besides that minor issue my room was large , clean , plenty of amenities . Security made sure only guests with keys were allowed upstairs where the rooms are located . Check in and check out was problem free . Vale ##t parking was very easy and convenient . I am already looking forward to staying during my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Warm atmosphere , excellent service and at ##ten ##tive staff . The con ##cier ##ge left a sweet personal note for us since we ’ d indicated it was our anniversary trip . Except ##ional ##ly clean room while small was not cramped . We loved the lobby and we ate at the restaurant 312 adjacent for breakfast every day of our stay . Del ##icious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been stayed many times at the Palmer House over the years but now I will not bother - It have the old world charm but the c ##rou ##ds and hotel processes have overwhelmed the hotel . Plus I found the room to be small and without views so it is time for a change . I love hilt ##on but I will be staying at the newer prop ##ort ##ies from now on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived in a snow storm and so the inviting warmth of the hotel and our welcome were all the more inviting . The hotel is superb ##ly located just off Michigan Avenue on a quiet side road . Our room was spot ##lessly clean as is the rest of the hotel . Love ##ly large room and bathroom , with a huge shower . We only ate in the hotel once , menu seemed a little limited but what we had was good quality and the service was friendly . The roof terrace wasn ' t open when we were there but the views from the Lo ##bby on the floor below were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed the hotel . Staff nice helpful and friendly . Great idea with 10 dollars off if you don ' t get the room cleaned . Save ##s the environment . However all the shower gel ##s etc are still in small plastic bottles . The room was large and clean . Very corporate but it is a business hotel . The gym was very well equipped but hotel gym I have seen without being a leisure club for members as well . The down ##side with hotel that it was not a nice cocktail bar on a higher floor with views of Chicago , only the bar on the ground floor . Only coffee in the room , no tea bags . We would stay again if we visit Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ok this is hands down the dirt ##iest hotel I ’ ve ever been to . First off , the room they picked for me , the view was fairly decent and the bed was decent ##ly made up . Well except for one little problem . . . . there was piss ST ##IL ##L in the toilet ! R ##EA ##LL ##y ? And then , when they moved to me to another room , hair in the shower and on the bed skirt . High ##ly recommend going to another hotel . This place is a capital “ D ” disaster ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a beautiful hotel in a great walking area of Chicago . Service was excellent and accommodation ##s were great . My only complaint was the expensive v ##alet of $ 75 per night or self parking offs ##ite of $ 50 per night . Otherwise , was perfect and the views are amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our 2nd stay here , and I want to tell you that we love this hotel ! - great location and wonderful service . My only negative was that my husband and I both found the mattress to be very uncomfortable and woke with back pain each morning . Matt ##resses are , however , a very personal preference , so I do not fault the hotel for this . We enjoyed a wonderful stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I liked the hotel location . The staff are very friendly and had few good suggestions for places to have dinner . the room was very clean with great city views . The bed was comfortable . I liked the location , the staff and the views from the room . Will be coming back again for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a sky ##line suite , which gave us a large room with a nice view . We ' d gotten a good discount , but had we paid full price I would have been very disappointed . The room was nice enough , but other than size , it was really nothing special . The bed was very comfortable , but I needed another blanket and noticed one was provided in the closet . It was very rough and rat ##ty looking - really would not have expected that even in a lesser hotel . Good location on W ##ack ##er close to Michigan Ave so we could walk to a lot of things . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The greeting at the front door was friendly . Door ##s are always held open and assistance offered . The check - in process was smooth . We were very impressed with our Superior King room ! El ##egan ##t de ##cor , comfortable bed and a room ##y closet with drawer - mounted safe . The bathroom had double van ##ities and an amazing shower . Being tall ( and handsome ) , low shower heads are the ban ##e of my existence . The Conrad ' s shower head , however is mounted high and has a plea ##sing rainfall effect . Very nice ! The Conrad is well located midway up the Ma ##g ##M ##ile and is walk ##able to the Loop , Navy Pier , Bloom ##ing ##dale ' s and most area restaurants . Unfortunately we didn ' t get the chance to visit their lounge , but are looking forward to doing so the next time we visit . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nice hotel . The entry is being renovated but they seem to have the work under control and it was not very bother ##some . The room was nice and comfortable . However it could have been a little cleaner . For a hotel in the city it was quite as well [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was a great choice for our first visit to Chicago . The employees were super helpful & friendly . The hotel ’ s convenient River North location made it easy to walk everywhere . Ad ##ded bonus was the reasonable price , the continental breakfast ( chocolate c ##rois ##san ##ts - y ##um ) and the evening beer & wine reception . I strongly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] G ##ar ##bage was piled in the hall due to lack of house ##keeping . Room ##s were fairly dirty . It was posted that house ##keeping would not come in during the trip which was fine , but it was difficult to get towels / trash changed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not only is this hotel in a great location , with f ##abulous staff and wonderful rooms , but they have a compliment ##ary wine hour in the lobby and you can request a gold ##fish companion sent to your room . The hotel is pet friendly , but the option to have a gold fish is a fantastic touch that made my stay even more enjoyable . The door man was also very friendly and always offered to help with advice and directions . I would stay here again next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was mid - West friendly , court ##eous and professional . Room ##s were spacious and clean with decent toilet ##ries and a well stock ##ed mini ##bar . Room service was on the spot and ta ##sty . Wonderful restaurants nearby and Michael Jordan ' s St ##eak ##house in the hotel . Con ##ven ##ient and comfortable . I ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What can I say . . . perfect location and nice grand hotel . Front office staff was very professional , di ##tto with door people and bell staff . Room was very nice and modern . Walking distance to Oak street shops ( the Rod ##eo Drive of Chicago ) , Water Tower Mall , Bloom ##ing ##dale ##s at 90 ##9 N . Michigan and Oak street beach . Also walking distance to a good spot to watch the fire works at Navy Pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel and a Great location ##1 My to ##ddler got caught on the elevator without me which , of course , for any parent kicks in major panic . I caught another elevator down to the lobby , but when I arrived in the lobby , no kid . Em ##p ##loy ##ees and security were able to find him on the cameras within a couple of minutes and organized to lock down the hotel and coordinate bringing him to the lobby . The hotel later sent a nice little note and kid related items to the room . Thanks to John Goodman ( Director of Security ) and the hotel staff for re ##sol ##ving a very panic - stricken moment rapidly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was quiet & had a wonderful bed . Great location near Red Line , Mill ##eni ##um Park , Art Institute & many restaurants . The lobby ceiling is stunning ! Lots of history at the Palmer House . Best thing about the hotel is the service from every person who works there ! Check - in , bar service , restaurant & maid service , Di ##jana was most helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service is great . The staff is extremely helpful . The subway is a few blocks away . Restaurant ##s and shopping is right there on Michigan avenue . We did not rent a car we just used public trans ##piration which worked out fine . The room , we had a suite , was great . Co ##m ##fort ##able . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in the theater district of Chicago ' s loop . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms , great amenities , close to everything , and wonderful staff . Coffee and Ice ##d Coffee in the morning and Pro ##se ##co Happy Hour in the evenings . I ' d highly recommend them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the reception desk to the suite , we have had a best experience ever ! Michael , at the front desk is V ##ER ##Y professional and knows how to care guests . The suite that we stay was V ##ER ##Y clean , spacious and comfortable . Location could not be better . Five stars ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great trip . everyone was very pleasant . these dishes were outside of a room in our hallway for about four days . They weren ’ t our dishes but they kept sitting in the hallway . We actually called and asked them to remove the dishes and they still sat there for a couple more days . Finally my husband actually moved them right in front of the doorway . This was disgusting and gross . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had never stayed at the O ##m ##ni in Chicago before , but wanted a convenient location on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Great choice . The rooms were very spacious and comfortable . The restaurant breakfast b ##uff ##et was really good . . . one of the best I ' ve had . Will definitely stay there again when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently traveled to Chicago on a quick 3 - day trip . We have visited Chicago on many occasions and we normally stay in the magnificent mile area close to shops , or Mill ##enia ##l park , the theatre district , etc . For this trip we decided to stay in a neighborhood called Gold Co ##st , the location was excellent . Close to the shops , the subway , and a beautiful neighborhood to walk around it remind us of the upper west side of NYC . The hotel rooms were spacious and the staff was very friendly , Mr . Melvin Joaquin was very nice making sure things were made upright as we have a few hi ##cc ##ups with our first room assigned at check - in . Please be aware the hotel has not self - parking ; however , had a Vale ##t parking service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco was wonderful ! It ' s within walking distance to Marshall Fields and shopping and the Theatre District ! We parked the car and walked everywhere ! Clean , CO ##MF ##OR ##TA ##BL ##E B ##ED ##S , LA ##R ##GE rooms ( 2 Queen Bed ##s ) and updates were very nice . Love ##d the Dec ##or and the Staff was great ! Good Value in the city ! Quick walk to the R ##IVE ##R , Michigan Ave , Bank of America Theatre , the Oriental and Chicago Theatre . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First off , the staff was great , no complaints there . The downtown location was also super convenient , we walked to several attractions . The lobby area is beautiful and very spacious , that being said , the rest of the hotel seems dated by comparison . The rooms are nice and were very clean , but , again , seemed dated . New ##er hotels have multiple power outlets and our room had several areas where the paint was chip ##ping away . I didn ' t like the fact that they charge extra for Internet and , if you want a mini fridge in your room , it ' s an extra 25 dollars . The prices for items in the mini bar are crazy so we just walked to the Whole Foods down the street and loaded up on snack ##s and water . Overall , the staff and the location are great but probably won ' t stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved staying here ! We had a nice corner room overlooking the river . Everything is within walking distance . We walked to Navy Pier & up & back Michigan Ave as well as the river walk area ! The hotel is in great shape & has lovely meeting rooms which we used with our company . The staff is excellent & happy to assist . We would definitely stay here again . Shu ##la ' s St ##eak ##house is in the building , wonderful meal there . There ' s a pub / ha ##mb ##urger place on the river ##front & also a fine bar with nice tap ##as in at ##rium . Great place to stay while in the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you ' re taking the time to read this review . . . chances are you ' re either looking for an event venue , a place to stay in Chicago or a great place to eat . Co ##mb ##ine those options with great am ##bian ##ce , an amazing staff and a delicious menu and you ' ve found your spot . My husband and I recently got married at the hotel in the W ##al ##nut Ball ##room and Al ##yssa Alexander , Director of Cat ##ering , not only helped our vision come to life , but brought a sense of ease to the planning process . The attention to detail and creativity of all involved went beyond what we could have dreamed for and most importantly , above all , is the feeling we remember of how welcomed we felt and how special the day was , all in help of this team . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was fine but found it odd that there was not closet . The room was good size which was particularly nice . The beds were comfortable and felt there was nothing that I would change . A gentleman came in each day around 2 in the afternoon to count inventory . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Here for a family event , and we were extremely happy with the service throughout . However , today was over the top . Our flights were cancelled and we had to re ##che ##ck into th hotel . Paula , at the ambassador check in was beyond g ##rac ##ious . Instead of a regular suite as we had booked - she placed us into an executive suite with a private elevator and views to die for . Then took care of re ##so ##s to Eddy V ’ s for us last minute . Thanks so much . Room ##s throughout stay were great . Staff at Mi ##che ##al Jordan ’ s as well as Bell ##M ##en were fantastic . Location of course . . . tops . Thank you I ##C , we will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I didn ' t ask for a view room but I got one . View of Grant Park and Lake Michigan were f ##abulous . Could see the She ##dd and the planet ##arium . Check in was fast and Express check ##out couldn ' t be beat . Little self service food are downstairs was great . Coffee , drinks , cookies and brown ##ies . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really nice room - - - we had a larger queen on the 13th floor with great views . The service in the bar and on the rooftop were excellent , as was the front desk . The hotel is crisp , clean and modern . I loved it and plan to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A reasonable hotel stay . No adverse / unpleasant experiences . Location was great . I was taken a ##back at how old the hotel seemed . It wasn ' t di ##lap ##idated or anything , but the carpet ##ing / rooms / hallway ##s seemed rather weather ##ed and worn . Clean rooms though and good service . I expected much more stellar quality though that would be ##fit the Fair ##mont brand . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful location and fantastic hotel ! ! Steps from Michigan Ave and all the restaurants and shopping you could want and ask for . Park ##ing was $ 70 a day . A little high for staying at the hotel , but then again it is Downtown Chicago . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has a great ballroom and lobby but some of the rooms are in much need of a re ##furbishment . It just didn ’ t feel clean . The tiles in shower were black , R ##ust round corner of the wall and the air vent was covered in dust . I would definitely stay in another hotel if I was visiting [SEP]
1	[CLS] We choose this hotel because of it ' s location . It is a half a block from the red line which took us to W ##rig ##ley Field for a Cubs game . We parked in the parking garage on the corner using Spot Hero . It was cheaper to park there than to drive to W ##rig ##ley Field area to park . The hotel stored our luggage until we were able to get back from the game . The sitting and kitchen areas are separate from the bedroom which has a door that could be closed . Very spacious . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed for 5 nights in this beautiful historic hotel . The story behind this hotel is amazing and the lobby is not to be missed . Consider sneaking a peak into any of their ballroom ##s to see the amazing architecture and ch ##and ##elier ##s . The rooms are slightly dated but the bed was very comfortable ! ! I would return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just back from a long weekend in Chicago staying here . This is a great hotel but the best thing about is the location . Close to the river ( our room had a view of the river ) and to bars , restaurants and attractions . The staff were very pleasant and helpful . Free coffee and wine in the lobby are a nice touch . The room was a good size and there was no noise at night even though we were facing the front of the hotel . Would definitely stay here again when visiting Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was in a nice , convenient location . Room ##s were clean , and staff were overly friendly and helpful . Breakfast was good . . . crowded just as the hours suggested , so take their suggestions if you are in a hurry ! Bell ##man were nice to hold the luggage while we still toured the city , so that was helpful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Karen M ##O ##Y helped set up my proposal for my engagement at this location . She took care of E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING . I know my fi ##ance was completely surprised and will never forget everything Karen did for us . We will always come back to this location when staying in Chicago . That kind of service is what keeps a loyal customer base . This location is definitely one of our top picks for our wedding / reception . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in a Executive suite which was a $ 400 / night suite with no bath ##tub in it ? S ##nac ##k items had to be picked up by going down 40 floors and carrying them into the room is not a definition of luxury . We had a request for hot water when we clearly said it is for making formula for the baby - after 40 min we had to call back and they said it will take another 30 - 40 min . This is not how a family friendly hotel works . At check ##in upon finding no bath ##tub we went down to the lobby to ask about it and the check ##in agent had no idea what I was talking about . At check ##out we requested directions to the hotel ' s underground parking and we go no answer after waiting for 10 min . Finally had to go outside the hotel and ask the bell ##hop for directions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] L ##O ##VE ##D staying at the Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro . Price was moderate , but the hotel feels like a luxury ups ##cale hotel . Overall the hotel is b ##aut ##iful and decorated in art de ##co style . The rooms are co ##zy and comfortable , the gym is up to date and well maintained , the happy hour is a great bonus and really makes the Kim ##pton stand out . The best part was the con ##cier ##ge ( whose name I can ' t remember , unfortunately ) ; he gave us the best recommendations for restaurants and things to do , and was always ready and willing to help . Can ' t wait for my next trip to Chicago , and when it happens I will absolutely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My boyfriend and I were greeted by Ms . K front desk reception ##ist . She was extremely friendly and very in tune to my mood and needs . After one delay after another while traveling to the hotel , I was exhausted . Finding out that our room was not ready only made matters worse . I expressed my frustration but Ms . K remained calm and s ##ym ##path ##ized with me and upgraded our room . which was magnificent . Just talking to that young lady put me in ##o a better mood . I wish more people who deal with the public could p ##oss ##es her attitude and willingness to help others [SEP]
1	[CLS] The All ##egro was a fine hotel . Pretty comfortable and well located . I must though give everyone a heads up on the Kim ##pton chain . The last two stays I have had at Kim ##pton , the rates changed from night to night . This happened in San Fr ##ans ##isco and Chicago . The rate went up more than $ 100 from a Friday to a Saturday night . Look closely at the rates before booking . The manager accommodate ##d me and gave me the same rate but this is a sneak ##y practice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When looking for a hotel I decided I wanted a bout ##ique style . This Ki ##nz ##ie fit the bill and then some ! The price was right , the am ##bie ##nce was excellent , the rules were incredibly comfortable for 4 people , the breakfast right outside our door all that we can ask for , the evening reception with drinks and ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres was a perfect way to start the evening , and finally the location was a deal as it gets . My husband and I traveled with our two daughters who are 16 and 20 and I know we all felt the exact same way about the Ki ##nz ##ie . . We L ##O ##VE ##D this place ! I ' m certain of two things . Will definitely return to Chicago and without any doubt we will stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] enjoyed our stay , the lobby is beyond words , the wedding was an event to remember . Food is excellent , Room ##s were in need of some up ##dating but still lovely . Near to shopping , din ##ning and clubs , Don ##t forget to take in a show , a deep dish Chicago pizza . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was awesome here . The staff were all very nice . They could all help you with any question we had about Chicago . Would highly recommend this hotel . They recommended taking a cab at night instead of driving . They even flag ##ged down a cab for us . My 2 daughters loved the bathroom and the rainfall shower head . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It has a great location just next to the Drake Hotel . Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ( shopping district on Michigan Avenue ) , Oak Street Beach and a lot of museums . I was not impressed with amenities of this hotel . I know there is this light ##ed dancing floor in the ballroom like in the movie with John T ##ra ##vo ##lta but I don ' t care for it . It is si ##ad to be the only one in Chicago but I don ' t know if this is the truth . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After our reservation was " lost " resulting in us sitting curb side for 3 hours we were told our parking would be compliment ##ary by multiple v ##alet staff . Upon check out we received a bill for parking at $ 100 . The " manager " Cody Cook was the least genuine helpful person in hospitality I ' ve ever met and charged us any way . This hotel should re ##con ##side ##r their definition of " hospitality . " [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights on our way to Seattle . Very clean and t ##idy hotel comfortable bed . Staff very helpful enjoyed the happy hour each evening . Hotel handy to city centre will definitely use this hotel again . Star ##bu ##cks entrance from the hotel lobby also a plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amber the lady at the reception was exceptional and very court ##eous . Sur ##ren ##der the man at the entrance door was very friendly with a great sense of humor . Great location , great food , great people , excellent hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The 1927 K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Chicago delivers historic charm in the downtown ! N ##est ##led between the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and the water , the picturesque hotel provides an elegant o ##asis and city views . T ##ip : Ex ##ped ##ia offers a king ##ly stay for the standard rate ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have just had a wonderful 4 night stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago . The hotel is modern , clean and very well equipped . The room was spacious , clean and had a great view over the city . The gym was fantastic , and the location is perfect , just 2 minutes walk from the shops of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and in a wonderful neighbourhood . When we come back to Chicago , we will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My 3 night visit was for the 2020 NBA All - Star game . The staff was busy but always smiling and professional . The property was fill with NBA players past and present having a great time . This is the place to stay when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book a loft room ! You won ' t always get a good city view , but these suites are spacious , have comfortable beds and sofa ##s and generally are well - appointed . If you feel like treating yourself , the P ##ump Room , while price ##y , is very good [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always fantastic ! Staff is amazing ! Location is perfect ! from the check in process to the check out process everything was fl ##aw ##less and perfect . The rooms are beautiful , huge and im ##ma ##culate . The bathroom ##s are equally incredible ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] As always the Kim ##pton hotels do not fail . I took my sisters to the Kim ##pton Monaco for a girls weekend away . They have never been and I wanted to share how awesome the hospitality is at every Kim ##pton . I was not disappointed . Wine hour was once again fantastic offering hot c ##ider with b ##our ##bon in addition to the wine . We were well taken care of in the restaurant after the show . They even accommodate ##d my sisters in adapt ##ing the menu for their food needs . I was pleased when they were looking up the other Kim ##pton hotels in Chicago to try . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are great . Love the suites and having a living space when staying more than 2 days . The rooms were clean , shower ##s warm with good pressure and beds comfortable . The staff was always friendly and the door ##men / bell boys were exceptional . I would stay here again upon returning to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Michael helped us out at the lobby bar as soon as we arrived . He found out it was my birthday and brought me over a slice of cake as well as a glass of champagne . He was extremely friendly and made sure all of his customers were taken care of . Thank you , Michael ! You have made us feel so welcome already . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago ! The location on Michigan Ave was great - easy access to shopping and restaurants , and it wasn ' t far to the museums either . The room was very nice - my kids loved that we had a separate living area with a TV ( and another TV in the bedroom area ) , and the beds were extremely comfortable ! The staff was great to the kids - welcome bags upon arrival and milk and cookies were delivered to our room in the evening . We ordered room service for dessert and for breakfast and the staff who brought it to the room were so kind and friendly . ( food was really good too ) Pool area was great too - a way for the kids to un ##wind before bed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni was a great hotel for a family with a young child . The room was very functional allowing our 4 year old to sleep in one room while my husband and I could watch t ##v in the bedroom . The help getting cab ##s and making recommendations was very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were coming across country via Amtrak and missed our connection in Chicago . Amtrak put us up in this hotel after being on the train for 2 days in a city we had never been to . We were tired , confused and a l ##il lost , lo ##l When we arrived to the Hotel , De ##met ##rie welcomed us at the front desk and was extremely helpful and friendly . He went above and beyond the scope of his duties to make us feel welcome and comfortable in this new big beautiful city ! We got a beautiful room with a spectacular view ! He is exactly the type of well rounded , goal oriented individual you want representing your business . He definitely needs to be commended and promoted for his exceptional work . Thank you D [SEP]
1	[CLS] The overall - very good . However , the check in went not smoothly . We need ##e to change the room , and wonder with our luggage upon arrival . I assume , that some persons are not well prepared for sitting at the front desk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful stay at the O ##m ##ni in Chicago . The staff were warm and welcoming . The hotel was spot ##less . The food go ##ur ##met . Location ideal - - bear Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an older hotel that has embraced its heritage rather than conceal it . All the modern comfort ##s are there , but they ' re presented with a nod to a by ##gon ##e and g ##lam ##orous era . Room ##s are modest in size , but offer up everything one needs ( even if you D ##O have to pay for W ##i ##F ##i ) including house ##coat ##s , umbrella ##s , etc . Staff is friendly and the free prose ##cco from 5 : 00 - 6 : 00 provides an opportunity to meet other hotel guests . I could go on but su ##ff ##ice it to say that there ' s a good chance I ' ll be staying here next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was the perfect location for the museum campus . Getting taxi ’ s to and from was a breeze . The hotel staff were very helpful at all times . The pool is great and there are many options for dining . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##e at the restaurants were very good , staff eager to help out , rooms always clean but furniture was dated and p ##lum ##bing was sub par . . . shower was garbage , water flow not strong . Had to repair toilet lever myself when it came apart . Lam ##p shade on dated old desk , was broken , cut hand on it trying to repair , the solution per electric ##ian who came right away was just remove defect ##ive piece , no replacement . They came with band aids relatively quickly to stop blood dripping from hand after cutting on lamp shade . View from room I had , from West building was SP ##EC ##TA ##CU ##LA ##R . Made up for the other crap noted above . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We took the trip to ch ##ica ##go to see some of the ch ##rist ##mas things . This hotel had a great staff , really nice rooms and a great location . It was a couple blocks from Michigan Ave . which is where we walked up and down . We had a great trip and would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love every Kim ##pton hotel I ’ ve ever stayed at , but the Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco in Chicago had a very unique charm to it . All the best parts of Chicago at your feet . Sur ##pass ##ed all our expectations and made for two incredibly enjoyable stays . T ##ip : Book a room overlooking the Chicago River for an extra special river views . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They treated the runners very special and provided me a room with an awesome view ! ! Love love this hotel . Will definitely come back and check in this hotel on my future trips with family . And oh , they have a little kitchen inside the room ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker from Feb . 2 - 5 , after checking out I received a notice from the front desk stating a charge for $ 107 . 00 from items in the mini bar . The items in question were items I wouldn ’ t even consume if you gave them to me . I repeatedly explained that I never removed anything from the mini bar ( never do ) , and basically the manager just ignored my plea ##s and stated that the charges were going to stay on my account even though I didn ’ t take the items . Apparently they ’ re house ##keeping staff is not fall ##ible . I got R ##IP ##P ##ED OF ##F ! A ##vo ##id at all costs , plenty of choices to stay in Chicago , don ’ t stay here , they ’ ll just take your money without getting anything in return but a has ##sle . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just returned from 3 night stay here , perfect trip . Staff here are amazing - everyone at the con ##cier ##ge desk was friendly and helpful , es ##p . appreciated free app ##eti ##zer coup ##on at Lou Mal ##nat ##i ' s . Guys out front , es ##p . Michael , were great - found us amazing driver to airport for good price . Best beds and pillows , good restaurant on river ##walk for b ##urger ##s , quiet and clean . Location can ' t be beat , views fantastic from 28th floor , water view . Been here twice and hope to return ! Thanks to all staff who made our trip special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed in with three rooms at the Conrad and checked to see if there were any possible upgrades and immediately got all three rooms with Michigan Avenue views . The front desk were helpful and as pleasant as could be . Room was spacious and and as nice as any in the city . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not your typical cramped city king room . This place is a must stop if visiting the city . Just one block off the magnificent mile and within walking distance of everything the Wind ##y City offers . A ##wes ##ome job Conrad ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My spouse & I along with our 3 children enjoyed staying at this hotel ! It is quite luxurious for the price . My only complaints is that when I book online I never get the view that I book . I booked a lake view and got a city view room , but was pleased none the less . In addition we booked the two double beds and it was almost too small for the two adults , I found myself almost falling out of the bed a few times . Gorge ##ous bathroom and robes included ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in constant contact with the manager Amanda . My one night stay was designed for a proposal to my girlfriend . She and the hotel accommodate ##d all my needs and wants to make the night special . This meant , getting a white cloth table & plates set up in the room . Before and during my stay the staff was able to work fast and answer my questions . It was a great experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was Beautiful , and full of Downtown Chicago Lu ##x ##ury Cha ##rm ! ! The Sky ##line View was breath ##taking and the staff were very professional and Friendly . Everything was in L ##y ##ft / U ##ber or walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for the Chicago Marathon 2019 ! What a perfect location for your family to have as a base area to meet you at the different check points without them having to run a marathon ! L ##OL The hotel was beyond our expectations with service ! bell man assistance ! de ##cor ! and the quality of the most com ##fy bed & linen ##s ! All of this is important when needed a nice resting nest before a big race . They also don ' t ski ##mp on their coffee & tea selections . We truly enjoyed staying here & plan to book for next year ! Almost don ' t want to share how great as we need a room for next year ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , staff always ready to help . Love ##d the fact that the living room space is separated from the room , keeping away noises from noisy hall bypass ##er . Love ##d the bath products ( soap , s ##ham ##po ##o , condition ##ner ) . Is right in the middle of the action ( shops , restaurants etc . . . ) . Would definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was perfect - Thank you ! Great check in experience with Daniel , service at the bar was fantastic . Room and views are gorgeous . Con ##cier ##ge service is excellent , Thank you Kathy . In room dining service , delivery and food was great . A wonderful weekend and excellent translation of the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal service , I also had the chance to meet with the Director of Front Office C ##int ##ia Be ##cer ##a who was very welcoming ! Thank you very much , looking forward to more visits when this Co ##vid ##19 is over . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for three nights in December , hotel is really nice and rooms are comfortable . They have a small cafe that also serves food . We did find it quite a hike to the magnificent mile but there are plenty of taxi ##s outside the hotel if you need one . Overall we would recommend it but preferred the Hilton Garden Inn which is right in the middle of the shops , bars and restaurants . Also , be ##ware if you need to leave your bags in storage there is a charge and you can ’ t pay on card ( which would have been nice to know before ##hand ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an amazing hotel . Where do I begin . The food , the service , the de ##cor , the rooms ! The staff jumped through ho ##ops to help us for even the most minor things . it is a beautiful hotel , just reopened after a big re ##mo ##del . . . it turned out beautiful . . . a lovely place . . . we loved it . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ser ##or is the best bartender ever . He makes sure you are comfortable away from home . Would recommend to anyone traveling to Chicago . He is a so ##mm as well as has excellent knowledge in mix ##ology . If you can think it up he can make it . You have to stop by and see him when you are in Chicago . He will make your whole visit memorable . - C ##ait , Jon ##ni & Rene [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a huge place with some f ##abulous history . It seemed the carpet in my room could be as old as the building . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . Ad ##e ##qua ##te W ##IF ##I and OK bathroom even if p ##eel ##ing a bit . Sur ##prise ##d at no coffee making facilities in the room but the o ##b ##liga ##tory noisy fridge . Well located for the center of Chicago . Some might find the L a little noisy . Stay on the other side of the building . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the time we pulled in to the time we pulled out everyone was at the top of their game . You could not ask for better services then what we got during our stay . We thank all of you for making our visit enjoyable [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here whilst attending a trade show in Feb . 2019 . Re ##ceived a great welcome , and when I voiced concern with the location of my room , I was moved immediately , without f ##uss . Co ##m ##fort ##able room , great bed and the bathroom is really well lit ( my big grip ##e usually ! ) . Very convenient Star ##bu ##cks attached to the foyer . The bar is the only place I feel lets it down a little - expensive and sting ##y with the mix ##ers - my very basic g ##in ( with it ' s one skinny lemon slice ) was too strong , so I requested some extra ton ##ic . A th ##im ##ble ##ful arrived in a w ##hisky glass . Bar aside , do stay here - it ' s a great hotel , the people are lovely and the location is a treat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel for a recent stay in Chicago with my two daughters . The location on Michigan is convenient and central to shopping . Although our room on the tenth floor was spacious enough , the room was extremely dark , primarily because of the brown and navy de ##cor . Fu ##rn ##iture seemed to have seen better days and the entire room was really in need of an update , or at least a good cleaning . Again , fair price for the location but next time I will try elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful service . Especially Eddie the bartender ! Our room had a beautiful view of the river . Love ##d that we got a $ 10 daily credit for not using house ##keeping services ( better for the environment ) . We ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel . Just perfect and convenient when visiting with family but not wanting or being able to stay with them . Only suggestion . . . we checked in later in the evening and did not get any explanation of what services were available or how the elevator worked . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got to our room yesterday and there was an empty soap wrap ##per in the middle of the floor , rings on the sink in the bathroom , and the toilet seat was dirty . The room had been barely cleaned . You would think that at a time like this the hotel would at least do the bare minimum to keep things cleaner seeing that CO ##VI ##D is still around . They ' re obviously not taking extra pre ##ca ##ution ##s to ensure the safety of their guests by keeping the rooms clean . If Lori didn ' t block everything off we definitely would have gone somewhere else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in and out was a breeze . Room was clean and looked recently updated . No waiting for the elevators which was very nice considering the size of the hotel . The p ##each sandwich from the Cafe was amazing . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was V ##ER ##Y friendly , gave us waters every time we walked through , asked how we were doing and if we needed any recommendations ! The hotel was clean , we could walk to the river , it was right by t ##rump tower which is a beautiful part of the city , and we could walk to lots of shopping ! We would definitely stay here again when in Chicago ! In all a great experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was one of our best experience in such a good hotel . Very good location , very good and polite staff and very clean hotel . You can reach to almost every things in down town just with walking . Hop on hop off bus station is exactly in front of the hotel . One of the best attraction in Chicago is river walk that we could go every night as it was beside of the hotel . Another good experience was Chicago helicopter tour . If you have time book in advance and enjoy the beautiful view of the city from top . I sent some photo of our tour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a Mar ##riot ##t Elite member traveling on business on 3 / 25 / 19 Great location , friendly staff . There was no wait to register , fast friendly staff . The Club lounge attendant ##s were super friendly and went out of their way to find me some Per ##rier water although it wasn ' t available . Both Connie A & Rene M went above and beyond to ensure I had all of my comfort ##s of home , which is price ##less when you live on the road ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] La ##S ##haw ##n Spears at the front desk made my stay absolutely amazing . I was there for a business trip and her service , positive attitude and hospitality was splendid . She made me want to book at the Palmer house every time I visit Chicago , which I plan to do from hence forward . The hotel is beautiful , we upgraded to a suite which is spacious and comfortable . I highly recommend the hotel . Be sure to say hello to La ##S ##haw ##n at the front desk ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nicole at the front desk should totally get an award for customer service . She was very helpful to me and my family members . After she helped my friend find us , he came into the room saying how helpful the staff at the front desk was . Thanks Again ! R ##VR Radio Show ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had high expectations since it was a highly rated bout ##ique hotel . We had a hand ##ica ##p room , disappointing shower that s ##p ##rinkled l ##uke ##warm water . The front desk was notified 3 times for a bell ##man , who never came after 25 ##mins of waiting , I ended up dragging my 4 luggage bags down to street level by myself . Very disappointing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our 4th time at th ##s hotel . Each time , we do the Gold upgrade , primarily to ##r the staff th ##st works in that Lounge . Very thoughtful , g ##rac ##ious , and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They even remembered us from last time . The Manager , Cody , obviously cares that the hotel guests there get every need addressed . One day of our stay , he was even rolling a juice trolley around the lounge squeezing fresh orange juice tables ##ide for whoever wanted it . T ##HA ##T is going the extra mile . If you want a chaotic , always buzzing with activity kind of experience , stay at the H ##ya ##tt next door . If you want a relaxing place to just enjoy yourself and get very at ##ten ##tive service , stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There was no light from the window that could enter the room because our room went right to another building wall , separated only by roof fans which were very loud . Bell ##man was great , at ##ten ##tive , and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not what we hoped for for this Grand old Hotel in Chicago . No denying the impressive F ##aca ##de and ballroom and some other areas . But other areas could do with a re ##f ##resh - hallway ##s , rooms , etc . Staff were fine . Some ni ##ggles like nothing in mini - bar , not even water . Called down for water , but told that was not a service provided ! Had to pay $ 3 for each bag left at the luggage area - a bit of a poor approach for someone who has just paid the best part of $ 2 , 000 . At the price we paid $ 900 per family room ( x ##2 ) , we expected a bit more of a high class experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel overall was not too bad . It felt newly renovated and the lobby and rooms were clean , however , rooms were extremely small . The luggage and v ##alet staff seemed extremely over ##worked and just not happy . The check in staff were very kind and delight ##ful . Location was not bad just a couple blocks off Michigan Ave and a couple clocks north is the river . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Located on Michigan Ave . ' s Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile you couldn ' t ask for a better location to access shopping and restaurants . My room was spacious but my view was mostly of a brick wall . I ' m sure they have plenty of " view " rooms , I just didn ' t specify that in my reservation . The hotel is older and very beautiful . My friend ' s room was not quite as nice as mine - it seemed in need of a little up ##dating furniture - wise . I interact ##ed very little with the staff and did not use house ##keeping at all but everyone seemed very friendly and efficient . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently had a fantastic experience with Allan at the front desk . He was so helpful in a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting my stay I can ’ t say enough ! The 5 star service made the stay more than worth it . I recommend this hotel to everyone . Can ’ t beat it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very low key relaxing hotel . Nice sitting rooms for gathering with friends and a very nice restaurant with great food . All the staff was very helpful , they made our trip a real pleasure especially D ##wayne . He ' s the best ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved on a Friday in the early evening at Monroe street entrance . Total confusion , cars parked along the street with no drivers . No one from Hotel assisting those arriving and after entering the directions to check in which on the next floor a very long way across the upper lobby . Room nice but very small , especially bathroom . Charge ##d $ 12 a day for w ##i fi . No compliment ##ary morning newspaper or notice of automatic check out . Basic ##ally a very crowded tourist hotel . Price was right , however . You get what you pay for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , friendly staff and just the right amenities ! Love ##d the convenience of the continental breakfast on each guest floor . The bed was so ##oo ##oo comfortable , too ! The hotel location is great . . . Close to multiple L stops , Grant Park , Michigan Ave , Navy Pier and TO ##NS of restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of the loop . It ' s within a short walking distance to most theaters , the opera house and six blocks away from Michigan Avenue . The blue line train is one block away which means you can go from O ' Hare airport directly to your hotel for a $ 5 train ride . The front desk staff were all wonderful , charming and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . There ' s also free Pro ##se ##cco in the lobby every evening at 5 PM . Room ##s are standard , but very clean with a comfortable bed . Would highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The web c ##ite images of rooms in this Hotel are highly misleading . Pat ##rons are not given the rooms displayed , the front desk staff tries to palm them off with smaller less well lit rooms . The front desk staff are hardly welcoming . There is very little decoration in the rooms and pictures are scarce . Note ##paper and pencil ##s / pen ##s are not provided . In short this hotel needs shaking up , its breakfast ##s are good , the swimming pool has a lot going for it , but it seems to be living of a past reputation . The travel " Con ##ce ##ige " / Advisor was the one exception to the lack of enthusiasm among the front desk staff and most helpful and knowledge ##able . In short for the price there are alternatives within or near the same location . Over - priced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this property is very good . The hotel is in good shape and clean . The rooms are good size and comfortable . I found the bed ##ding and pillows well above average . Sleep quality was far above average . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the third time we have stayed at this hotel and have loved every stay ! Perfect location right on Michigan Ave . close to shopping , Navy Pier is a short walk from right outside the door . Also love having a Star ##bu ##cks right off the lobby ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had three days at this hotel which also hosted the convention . They did a good job with a clean comfortable room and friendly staff . The reception staff were very helpful . The breakfast in the reception also good but we had one day where we couldn ' t find anywhere in the hotel for open lunch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I just got back from Chicago and we stayed three nights at Swiss ##ô ##tel . The room was clean and extremely comfortable . The new pen ##thouse gym was spectacular with wonderful views of Navy Pier . We cannot wait to go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here for the second time and it was a nice stay but not as nice as the first time . The pool is out of commission but mentioned nowhere . This was the first time we tried to self park . Vale ##t is $ 70 and pretty easy to figure out , drive up , get luggage , hand over keys . Self park , no one tells you that you are just supposed to park in front of the hotel ( yes you will be in the way ) go check , then the v ##alet man walked towards our car to help us find the lot underground . THE CE ##IL ##ING IS L ##OW , like insane ##ly low , so if you have a taller truck , call the hotel about parking . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great hotel . Clean , luxury , overall great pick . I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Chicago . It ' s in downtown and close to everything . Had breakfast and the food was fantastic . Great service all the way around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went for a weekend get ##away and it ’ s an ideal location for exploring downtown Chicago . We used the Wendell ##a water taxi and took a trip down the river . Love ##ly sky ##line ! The Intercontinental is my favorite hotel in Chicago . It ’ s next to the river , the staff is helpful and friendly , the actual building is beautiful and it ’ s fun to stay in a landmark hotel . One must visit the pool and the banquet rooms . They are filled with Chicago history . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a small hotel in an excellent location . The rooms were comfortable , clean , and newly upgraded . The service was wonderful . I would not hesitate to come back every time I visit Chicago . I would definitely pick this hotel over any " hotel chain " in the city . Great for singles and families ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed 4 rooms over the post - Christmas weekend for shopping and museums . From the 20 ##s de ##cor to the window seats to the pu ##pp ##ies everywhere , we had a great time . The staff got us into our rooms Friday am so we would be free to explore for the day . The teenage girls needed b ##ob ##by pins for new hair ##dos and someone vanished and returned with them , at no charge . I am a frequent Kim ##pton fl ##ier and they are all good but what a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Across from Harry Carey ’ s , AM ##A building and a Trump Tower / Hotel . Easy walk to magnificent mile and Clark / Lake train depot . Room clean . Nice staff . Resort fee added to night ##ly rate to cover breakfast / free evening reception . T ##F [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked a surprise Anniversary for me and my wife and paid more for a special champagne and straw ##berry ’ s toast upon arrival . We got there and had a hard time checking in and we were forgotten about . Other than that the hotel was nice and the breakfast was good . Our shower was a little messed up but I could live with that . I just wish they would have helped me start off my anniversary on a better foot instead of treating me like another customer . They did take the charge off but that can ’ t replace the memory we could have had . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel & its staff is very nice . My room was well equipped , large , and had a comfortable bed . What more could you need ? Problem was , my room faced an alley ##way . Even from the 11th floor I was woken every single morning ( B ##EF ##OR ##E D ##A ##W ##N ) to the sound of trash collection . It was S ##O loud and went on for S ##O long that it interrupted my sleep pattern every single day . As someone who came to town for an important work trip , I really needed my sleep . So if I am in town again and somehow have to stay at this hotel , I will request a room away from the alley ##way . P ##LE ##AS ##E T ##A ##KE NO ##TE OF T ##H ##IS ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is really huge . Room ##s are spacious but a bit cold ( i couldn ' t lift up the temperature above 80 ##F ) W ##if ##i works very and the staff is truly friendly . Food is the only weak point as they serve am ##eric ##an kitchen which is not really okay for a euro ##pe ##an travel ##ler for long term [SEP]
1	[CLS] After 2 days there we got sick , carpet never clean , sticky room , noisy air condition and we can hear the elevator from all the rooms ! The lobby is beautiful but rooms are so old and not clean , I can ’ t believe the comments can be so good about this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##ai ##zal , the bell ##man , at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was by far the best staff member that we came in contact with throughout the whole stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie . He was more than helpful , and went above and beyond to make sure we had all that we needed . If you stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie , make sure to recommend F ##ai ##zal to assist you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el is located at the Northern end of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping area near some very high end stores . The design is highly modern and luxurious from the lobby to the rooms . The staff is all very friendly and helpful . As is typical of downtown hotels , the rooms are on the small side , but are impressive ##ly furnished , and the bathroom has both a shower and a separate bath ##tub . There are excellent views from some of the higher floors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We liked the location as we could walk to the parks , the shopping and the theatre . Quiet room , which we app ##re ##ica ##ted . We were surprised the lobby bar was closed when we came back from the theatre at 11 . Room design a bit awkward for two people as too many doors between closet and bathroom . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Intercontinental Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , lived up to its reputation . The meeting rooms was perfect for our needs , as were the guest rooms . In addition the hotel staff were always available when needed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Em ##p ##loy ##ees there were all so helpful and friendly . Room ##s were surprisingly average . If there was continental breakfast , I was not aware . This was a business trip , so I had no control of where I stayed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They charged me for the room even though I had paid s ##m ##6 ##d booked online months ago . I was not even told they were doing this at check out . At check in they said all good . They ' ve ruined my bank balance and so my trip as well . B ##unch of in ##com ##pet ##ent shy ##sters . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is huge , classic , historic , and perfectly located for Loop theatre , State Street shopping , the Art Institute , Orchestra Hall , and the Museum Campus . It ’ s close to the Ma ##g Mile too . The lobby is an attraction in itself - beautiful and grand . It can be packed and off - putting too , like the Si ##st ##ine Chapel as an airline terminal . Our Executive Level room was large and comfortable . The two bathroom ##s were updated but small . It ’ s the place to stay if you want to be in the Loop and want an historic Chicago feeling . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed for a night with the wife to get a way firm the kids . We had a great night and slept even better ! I ’ d recommend to anyone . Friendly and clean , the staff goes out their way to make everyone feel at home ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We held a senior executive round ##table at the So ##fit ##el Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and everything from the guest rooms , to the service , to the food were perfect . We will definitely return to the So ##fit ##el whenever possible . T ##ruly , everything was outstanding . We could not have asked for more . Thank you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 2 weeks before X ##mas , stayed in a 2 - room king suite for $ 116 / n ##t . That included dinner , wine and breakfast . The hotel has been very nicely renovated , looks great and is in a great location . Close to Mi ##ch Ave , the Loop , and River North . And a block from the L . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am currently staying at the hotel on business and the lobby is very nice . The rooms are clean and nicely decorated but on the smaller side . The hotel is good except the walls in the room are S ##O thin . Last night people ' s music in the room next to me woke me up at 4 am and I can hear all of the conversations people are having in the room next to me and it is almost impossible to sleep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] friendly staff , clean room , got a higher room with f ##abulous view , full b ##uff ##et breakfast and free dinner reception , free w ##if ##i great location to many restaurants and bus lines , fast elevator . stop for tour bus close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##ten ##tive staff unlike any I ' ve experienced ! Spot ##less rooms with beautiful de ##cor ! ! We happened to arrive early and were given a room immediately ! I felt like a million ##aire ( and was treated as if I was one ) Can ' t wait to stay again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I had the opportunity to visit Chicago for the first time after 20 years in the USA . We chose the I ##C Ma ##gni ##fica ##nt Mile and were absolutely delighted that we did . The hotel is amazing . A lovely renovation of the old buildings . Our King Suite was spectacular and the staff are superb , efficient and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great dinner at Columbus Ta ##p . Elizabeth was our server and she was more than nice and g ##rac ##ious . Not only did we walk away with a great meal , but we also left with recommendations for breakfast , happy hour and patio dining . Thanks for a great night . Always have a great stay at Fair ##mont . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was nice . It was walking distance to most of the Chicago well known areas . Good pair of walking shoes and a heart for adventure , and you can find some great food spots around . A shop ##pers dream ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I left my glasses in my room ( they fell under the bed ) and called four times to have house ##keeping retrieve them to send to me . Two of the times , I talked to either the front desk and / or house ##keeping , one of which said that they ' d get right back to me after checking the room . The other times I left messages . I have yet to hear from someone ; I checked out of Room 112 ##6 on 9 / 18 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here on a trip to ch ##ica ##go for a conference . The conference was at the west ##in which is 3 minutes away walking - actually just around the block . The millennium kn ##icker ##bo ##cker was more affordable and in the hear of many attractions . Lots of high end shopping available nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a nice stay in Chicago and this hotel is certainly convenient to Mill ##eni ##um Park and some areas of town , but it didn ' t stand out as Fair ##mont quality . Having recently spent a week at another Fair ##mont I was excited for the same level of service but this wasn ' t quite on par . We had a couple of minor issues that when discussed we felt a bit dismissed about - - delays at check in , poor communication of information about Gold room , the need to request a fold out bed three times before delivery and then no blankets provided upon delivery , extra fees not communicated , etc . Overall not the same level of pride in delivery of service or general in difference of staff . There really is a difference between GO ##OD and G ##RE ##AT . . . and if you want G ##RE ##AT , I recommend elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! Walking distance to restaurants , bars , shops , the lake , and attractions . Couldn ' t imagine a better location ! ! Staff very friendly and re ##sp ##ons ##ive , rooms were clean and comfortable . We will book here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great time in Chicago with guidance from the helpful and know ##led ##gable staff . Morning coffee , and ( very ) light breakfast was nice as well as evening wine and snack ##s . There was some street noise and our room offered a lot of light , but looked directly into the hotel across the street . Overall it was a great stay and the perfect location [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l many times over the years and have never had an problem . Upon my arrival this week , I had a minor issue with my room that was professionally and ex ##ped ##iti ##ously handled by Nicole and Josh at the front desk . They were very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Overall it was a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el is one of those hotels that has both el ##o ##quent appointments as well as a friendly open and welcoming staff . . . great views , clean hotel and wonderful bar . . . . it was a quick two day business trip and the So ##fit ##el made my stay that much easier . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The stay itself was great , we were upgraded to a better room because of my Gold status . The bartender ##s was super great . The room was really nice and had a great view . The only issue I had was at check out , I had called to let the hotel know that it was my wife and I birthday and we would be celebrating it at the hotel . They left a bowl of chocolate ##s in the room for us which we didn ’ t eat however we were charged for them at check ##out . I have been to a fair amount of A ##cco ##r hotels and I have never had to pay for what would be considered a “ gift ” for that reason the hotel gets 1 star off . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable clean room although slightly smaller than had hoped . Most importantly had a really good un ##int ##er ##rup ##ted sleep which was bliss . Great central location and surprisingly quiet . Looking forward to coming back to this hotel in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It were a very good pleasure to stay in this hotel , all the person ##els were listening to all ours demands and questions . The room were very clean and comfortable . The local ##isation of the room were perfect and very clear [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is always my first choice when I ' m in Chicago and they ' ve never let me down in my 15 + stays . Room ##s are beautiful and well appointed , but the service is what matters most and whether it ' s one of the restaurants ( which are both great ) , front desk or v ##alet , it ' s always A + . They also have one of the best gym ##s I ' ve ever seen in a hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am here for a conference and was put into a lovely room but wanted to be closer to the other attendees . La ##tas ##ha was at the front desk and totally hooked me up . She was friendly , a ##cco ##mo ##dating and seemed happy to do it . Really appreciate the service here . Thank you [SEP]
0	[CLS] My friend and I checked in last Wednesday with Cars ##arra H . She was amazing ##ly pleasant and extremely helpful . This was our first time visiting Chicago from NYC and she gave us a bunch of tips of where to go for food and attractions . Cars ##arra made us feel at home and welcomed and is a true professional ! Our interaction with her set the tone for our wonderful stay at the Hilton . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , I would recommend this hotel . Do know , you have to pay to park , even in the hotel parking garage . This hotel is near the water , but within walking distance of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Also of note , there are no in room charging stations for electronics , nor any ve ##nding machines . There are limited food and beverage items available for purchase in the lounge area which get charged to your room . The restaurant is currently room service only . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything can be reached by foot , surrounded by restaurants and jazz clubs , very close to the river and Pont du Sa ##ble , and Ma ##gni ##ficient Avenue . Help ##ing and always ready to help staff . Very big and con ##fort ##able rooms . Breakfast is included , but , to be honest , poor . Would definitely come back though ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay here for 4 nights and cannot fault it at all . The staff are great , really helpful and very friendly . The rooms are spot ##less and have everything you need . We didn ' t use the bar or restaurant so I cannot comment on those . The location is excellent and is within walking distance of all amenities . I would have no hesitation in recommend ##ing this hotel and I would definitely stay there again . Also if staying there try D ##4 bar near Navy Pier it ' s and Irish bar and definitely the best Irish bar I ' ve been in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I schedule a room for a meeting of about 25 folks , the Matter ##horn room was beautiful . The support team was excellent , the food , A ##V and environmental folks responded instantly to text messages . First class service . Thanks to Veronica , Peter and the PS ##AV folks [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here over Thanksgiving and it was great ! The location can ' t be beat . We had a " city view " which was basically a view of office buildings across from us , ( we were on the 6th floor ) , and if you got close to the window , you could see Harry Carey ##s . I don ' t think I would " upgrade " to city view again . However , the room was very nice . Clean , room ##y , V ##ER ##Y comfortable bed . Check - in was easy and they were so friendly and helpful at the front desk . All the employees we encountered were very nice . From 5 - 8 each evening they have a lounge area where you can get free Ho ##rde ##rve ##s and your first drink is free as well . Ho ##rde ##rve ##s were great , we didn ' t need to go to dinner after ! The breakfast on each floor was nice too . Nothing special but very sufficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was clean , spacious , updated and very welcoming . Our room had a river ##view and I L ##O ##VE ##D the window seat to watch the street below . Every staff member that we encountered was extremely friendly , always smiling . . Lots of interesting places to walk to right from the hotel as well . Best of all F ##RE ##E wine every night in the lobby for one hour . ! ! We will definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a little bout ##ique hotel right downtown . Our room had a beautiful view of the river . Our room had a cute little window seat that any little one would love to sleep in ! The staff was super nice , from the v ##alet , to the front desk , to house ##keeping . When you check in they give you a personal tour of your room and all amenities there . In the early evening they have a wine reception . You can walk to restaurants , shopping and the Oriental theater where Beautiful was playing . You really can ' t do better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We do not have one negative thing to say about our stay at The Talbot ! The staff , from the door ##man to the cleaning staff , greeted us with friendly hello ##s and have a great day ! We were given 2 drink tickets and the patio was a wonderful place to sit and enjoy a cocktail before heading out . Great location ! Close to Michigan Avenue with the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le but it is much less he ##ctic . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] When most of other good hotels were $ 400 + I found this around $ 300 . Nice hotel . You pay $ 15 for access to G ##Y ##M . Who does it these days ? The rate card does not clearly state it when you reserve , Watch for it [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful Hotel with an awesome staff . High ##ly recommended . Our experience was great from the v ##alet until the time we checked out of the Hotel . Bed ##s were comfortable and the rooms were spacious . Very quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this hotel . It was in a great location ( business district ) . P ##lent ##y of places in the area for breakfast and lunch . The d ##é ##cor was very pretty and the staff was exceptional . We arrived too early to check in . The desk took our number and called when a room was available - it wasn ' t very long . The rooms aren ' t huge , but easy enough to manage in . Crazy , fun animal print robes in the closet ! The beds were super com ##fy ! We missed the cocktail hour each day , but saw people enjoying it . They gym was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Overall , a great stay and would definitely go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The French touch at the So ##fit ##el cannot be overlooked and you will have to decide for yourself if it is cool or annoying that restaurants carry French names , staff addresses you in French and so on . As for the note itself , spacious rooms and everything on top standards as you would expect it from such a place . Very nice and class ##y bathroom . Staff is super friendly and helpful ( despite of the French touch ! ) . The So ##fit ##el is a good choice if you want to give your Chicago stay a class ##y and ups ##cale flavor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a dual property with a Hampton Inn . I definitely recommend booking the Home ##wood because the breakfast options are greater . The area requires key access so it is not nearly as crowded . The suite was clean and although it is an older building , you can tell that the staff are making every effort to overcome the difficulties that come with an aging building ( i . e . slow elevators ) . It was practically snow ##ing when we were there in April so the rooftop pool was still closed , B ##UT the hotel has a R ##O ##O ##F TO ##P P ##O ##OL in downtown Chicago ! Nice ! ! We would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this hotel ! the check in and check out process was nice and easy , very professional and friendly staff . I would like to mention Guadalupe in house ##keeping she was very nice to us . I would definitely come back to Mill ##eni ##um on my next visit to Chicago ! check them out ! Great location , walking distance to water tower mall , 360 ch ##ica ##go , the signature room 95 and wild ##berry cafe ! ! ! just perfect ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great service , clean rooms , helpful staff . We always stay here when we visit Chicago . The only negative is that the room service wasn ' t the best this time . My chicken was dry for my Caesar salad was dry so for the price , it was a bit of a disappointment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I took a 4 - day get ##away to spend some one - on - one time together . The hotel was absolutely amazing . We loved every aspect of our stay from the room , to the food to the overall service . We would highly recommend the O ##m ##ni and plan to re ##vis ##it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was clean upon arrival . Dec ##ora ##ted nicely - Excellent W ##i - Fi . Air Con ##dition ##ing worked perfectly . Very Co ##m ##fort ##able Bed with choices of 4 sizes of pillows . Room Window view was of other tall buildings put this results in no traffic noise so very quiet room from outside noise . Excellent water pressure and hot water in this hotel . Large bath ##tub – very clean and looks like newly re ##mo ##del ##ed . Good lighting in both room and bathroom . Very friendly and helpful Front Des ##k – easy to check in and out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a historical hotel with a very interesting architecture . I was disappointed with room , which was small and somewhat cold . Staff very friendly and helpful . Breakfast was good with a lot of choice . Overall I thought that the hotel was in need of renovation [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker while in Chicago to see Green Day at W ##rig ##ley . We took a r ##icks ##haw to the concert and had a great night sleep . Con ##ven ##ient to good coffee and don ##uts and a quick ride to O ha ##re . Hotel has character and the staff was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience , super friendly and helpful staff . Great location just steps from everything you want to see in the city . So great with young children . Would definitely recommend to friends and family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While the hotel is quite lovely , watch out for the parking rates . I was incorrect with the package I chose , and there was no assistance . I asked and for help and received blank stares . T ##ruly disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] temperature issues with room ( most expensive King room purchased ) , I ##m now sick [UNK] . Chicago is too cold to not be able to adjust the room temperature above 70 degrees . I contacted front desk to switch room to standard rate but they did not apply change [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love this hotel . It ' s right next to the park , shopping and the river . They offer a rate that has parking included . Since it ' s v ##alet , it makes your arrival and departure 10 times easier than trying to manage parking in the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been in others o ##m ##ni hotels and they are beautiful . I just wasn ' t impressed with anything considering this was Chicago and Michigan avenue . No W ##OW factor anywhere on the property . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ing . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was amazing ! Exactly what I would expect in the heart of Chicago . I was not impressed with the clean ##liness of the room and for the price I would expect more on as ##te ##tics of the room ! Overall it was fine ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed with my husband at Home ##wood Suite ##s when we visited Chicago a few days ago . The location was great , the mattress and pillows were very comfortable , our room was clean and the compliment ##ary breakfast was what we needed to start pleasant ##ly our day . I would recommend it ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything about the Conrad Hilton was exceptional . The staff was friendly and helpful , the room was clean and luxurious , and the heat ##h club had everything you can ask in a heat ##h club . Breakfast was great as well . Will definitely visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Breakfast was the best I have ever seen for a B ##uff ##et . This is the place to go even if your not a guest ! Direct ##ly across from Grant Park , Everyone was very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They also have a small grab and go area for those in a hurry . [SEP]

0	[CLS] My family and I spent a weekend at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker in Chicago and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago . From the moment we arrived until the morning we left , we were treated with g ##rac ##ious hospitality and imp ##ec ##ca ##ble service . The room was perfect for us , the dining area superb , and the personnel were truly outstanding . The location was handy to every place we wanted to visit . Do yourself a favor next time you are in Chicago . . . . . book a room here . You will be delighted you did ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve been here for business many times . Check in is always a breeze . The rooms are en ##sui ##te , making it easy to leave a sleeping spouse when getting up and out early for business . Room ##s are ample and all amenities are provided . The bar is fun - - with many options in both beverage and food options . The restaurant is better than the usual pass ##able hotel fare - - food is good and the wine selection will allow a mid - range wine a ##fic ##ion ##ado to find a bottle . Good for couples or families . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##g ##ree with other reviews on the excellent location to tourist things to do and abundant restaurants . All within walking distance . Other thoughts : The beds are the most comfortable I have ever experienced in a hotel . Apparently , the mattress ##es are special - made by Seal ##y for this hotel according to the front desk personnel . The in - room and compliment ##ary N ##es ##press ##o coffee / es ##press ##o machines make the best in - room coffee and es ##press ##o I ' ve ever had in a hotel room . You will hear ambulance sire ##ns at all times of the day . Bring ear plug ##s for sleeping and choose a higher - floor room . The rooftop bar is awesome at night . They make a great Old Fashion ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came downtown for a night out with friends and couldn ' t have been happier with our room and the location of the hotel . The hotel is wonderful ##ly located close to all of the Michigan street and nearby shops and restaurants . The room perfect - nicely decorated and well maintained . The work out room plenty big with all of the right equipment . Ad ##d the token ##s given to all guests for drinks in the early evening and I don ' t think you can beat it . We were very happy and will be guests again ! Well done Ki ##nz ##ie staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel really made our New Year ' s special ! Book ##ed NY ##E fireworks room which overlooked the river and city . First time doing this so didn ' t know what to expect . First , checked in online which was very easy with early check ##in option . G ##reet ##ed with ch ##amp ##ai ##gne upon arrival . A ##wes ##ome ! Used the online code to have keys made at the k ##ios ##k . B ##rill ##iant ! Got to our room on the 25th floor overlooking exactly what I booked . The room was comfortable and clean . Bed ##s perfect . The best part - the fire ##wo ##tr ##ks were right in front of our window so we had the most amazing view of the fireworks and the city I was really impressed with our stay and want to go back next year for NY ##E fireworks . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you want excellent service , respect for you as a customer , and time ##ly communication and response to questions , this is the hotel for you . Will never go to another hotel in Chicago and will heart ##ily recommend for anyone visiting the Wind ##y City . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room could not have been any more perfect , a true luxury hotel . Staff even more than at ##ten ##tive ! Excellent bed , bathroom was very luxurious ! Very large L ##CD TV mounted on the wall , with all HD channels . I came from the R ##itz which was the complete opposite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni hotel was a wonderful stay & experience with a room ##y bed and the excellent view of the corner room 1817 . The staff were at ##ten ##tive , including the kitchen , whipping up various foods for me at any time of the day . Off ##ering 24 / 7 room service , in addition to a bar on the 2nd floor . One of the only issues I had here was parking my car , due to the cost of my stay I considered v ##alet would be included , unfortunately this was $ 70 per night , but I took advantage of the $ 40 overnight parking at the adjacent hotel on East Huron s ##t . There is plenty of shopping , restaurants , and also a theater a few blocks south , and plenty more to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in the City attending the annual state school board member conference . I ' ve stayed at numerous hotels in the City . The location is excellent . Check in / out was very easy and quick . My wife and I felt the room was smaller than many of their competitors . It was clean and neat . We did L ##O ##VE the beds and linen ##s . They were extremely comfortable . Our shower temperature was hard to adjust . Also , they only have 4 elevators . On a busy Sunday morning , we had to wait for 5 cars to stop at the floor before we could get on the elevator . Overall , it was just average , compared to your options , on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Very nice bed and linen ##s , too few elevators , and the room was small ##ish . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was a pleasure to stay at the Grand , part of the SP ##G group . Very court ##eous and helpful staff . Excellent view of the lakes ##hore . Pleasant stay . The other best thing was the beautiful rivers ##ide or lake side walk where you could walk or eat enjoying the beautiful scenery . We had a meeting in one of the halls there and it was well served . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bailey checked us in and was a real joy . Knowledge ##able and efficient . Great buzz throughout the lobby with events going on . Sand ##wich at Chicago Burger Co was ta ##sty . Club Lounge attendant very persona ##ble - my wife and I enjoyed chatting with him , along with the great views from the lounge . It was our first time in Chicago and we enjoyed the location . We did an architecture river tour through Wendell ##a which was great too . . . walking distance from the hotel . Breakfast staff very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting - let us get an o ##mel ##et just as the b ##uff ##et hour was ex ##pi ##ring . Thanks for a nice stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pre ##pa ##id via Kim ##pton ' s own website for a suite room with a j ##ac ##uz ##zi tub . A ##rri ##ved at the property only to be told that due to a " g ##lit ##ch " in the system they didn ' t have the room type I had already paid for . Hotel attempted to contact sister properties to see if a similar suite was available and what they came up with was unacceptable . End ##ed up just going home as we live in Chicago and this was planned as a " romantic diversion " . Was promised a re ##fu ##nd , we ' ll see . I ' ll stay away from Kim ##pton properties from now on , I suggest you do the same . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Intercontinental was the perfect choice for winter in Chicago . The staff were all friendly and helpful , breakfast p ##lent ##iful with a great variety . The room we were given upon checking in did not have the view we would have liked so the very helpful gentleman at Re ##ception happily changed our room to 370 ##3 , this room t ##icked all of our boxes with its city and lake views and quiet ##ness . We were toast ##y warm the whole stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My friend and I spent the weekend in Chicago . When we went to check into the Hilton Chicago and the lines were crazy long . A Hilton employee called us over and asked if we were Hilton Honor members . We are both members . He immediately took my name and gave me points because he seemed genuinely concerned about our wait time . He asked us about what are plans were while we were in town . He told us some places to go check out while we were in Chicago . Do ##y explained that he had vacation packages that were very tempting to purchase . Although I didn ' t buy one I recommend staying at Hilton Chicago and stopping by to see Do ##y at Hilton Grand V ##aca ##tions . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My spouse was on a business trip and I tag ##ged along . This hotel is in a great location for exploring the city . I walked to nearly everything I wanted to see and do . Every member of the staff was friendly and helpful in answering questions and providing recommendations . The only negative I experienced was the noise level . When people close their doors , you really hear it ( the doors are very heavy and basically slam shut ) . It honestly wasn ’ t a huge issue , but wanted to mention it because I ’ d have given the hotel a 5 if the rooms were a bit more sound ##proof . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hot ##wire & Fair ##mont Chicago a completely disappointing experience ! Hot ##wire promised and did not deliver ! The Fair ##mont manager Cody Cory no help whatsoever ! A ##w ##ful customer service ! A terrible experience for our wedding anniversary ! Never use Hot ##wire or stay at a Fair ##mont property ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a room on the executive floor and Man ##dan ##a was very helpful and at ##ten ##tive . Very nice hotel suite and very clean . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful , pleasant and knowledge ##able . A very good hotel choice in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great trip ! H ##ya ##tt was well prepared for the large volume of crowds that were coming in . Everything ran smoothly from parking to check in to the overnight stay . Every staff member we talked to was very court ##eous and helpful . They went above and beyond to help . It was like watching a well oil ##ed machine work . The room was spacious and very clean . You can also tell the H ##ya ##tt is trying to be more green in their in room products and cleaning procedures . Overall a great stay and cannot wait to return as you are in the heart of shopping and sites . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l is a nice little o ##asis in downtown Chicago . Great service , gym , and views . Op ##ted for Swiss ##ote ##l over two head ##qua ##rter properties for the two different meetings I was attending . Much better choice and I got to see the sky each morning before being stuck in meeting rooms [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was fine . Good , just not great . The staff were pleasant and helpful , but no more or less than I expected . The hotel ' s location is great - river north , just a block off the river and pro ##xi ##mate to tons of restaurants , bars , and night ##life . Of course , that proximity also meant that there was a ton of street noise while I was trying to sleep - the windows do nothing to dead ##en the sounds . It was nice to have a breakfast b ##uff ##et on every floor , but the selections weren ' t that exciting , and I opted to go out instead . There just wasn ' t a lot of character to the place . In . City with as many hotels as Chicago has , I think a place should find a way to stand out , and I don ' t think the Ki ##nz ##ie did . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was disappointed with the H ##ya ##tt Re ##ce ##ncy Chicago . I have stayed at other H ##ya ##tt hotels and I am part of the World of H ##ya ##tt , but this hotel needs some up ##dating . We had 3 different rooms on different floors and was disappointed with all 3 rooms . The carpet was dirty and din ##gy in all rooms . The bathroom c ##log ##ged in one room and they had to replace the shower . Another room had 2 double beds when they paid for 2 queen ##s . Although we were up high our views were of an apartment complex . The location is not bad , but I think I would stay on the other side of the river next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ' t say enough about this hotel . Extreme ##ly convenient to the El and downtown . Very clean all throughout hotel , and rooms are very home ##y with super com ##fy beds / pillows ! We ##l ##coming and friendly staff - was able to get early check in and late check out ! We love Hilton hotels and this was one of our very f ##av ##s ! Won ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service in general has become so me ##dio ##cre that I seldom expect anything more . I was truly amazed at the level of personal service provided by the entire staff at The Palmer House . From the first greeting by the door ##man as he g ##rac ##iously held the door , to the wonderful girl at check - in , to the con ##cier ##ge , to the maintenance staff , the service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . The rooms are clean and well appointed . The amenities offered are second to none . I will stay here again without a second thought . Wonderful experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We absolutely loved staying here ! Not only it ’ s convenient ##ly located in the heart of downtown , but the staff is friendly , and the rates are reasonable . The eclectic de ##cor is f ##abulous ! ! The fact that it ’ s dog friendly is only the i ##cing on the cake . This will be our go to place whenever we visit Chicago ! Can ’ t recommend it enough ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The overall experience staying at the O ##m ##ni was great , with friendly staff and comfortable rooms . Breakfast was varied and delicious , I didn ' t see the gym or pool . The location was good for Chicago , nice restaurants and shops , [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great 5 day stay at Hotel Monaco . The location is wonderful . Easy access to Millennium Park , theaters , shopping ( both Michigan Ave . , and the less expensive State St . shops ) , tons of restaurants , river walk , and the L . The staff is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and our room had a window seat with a great view of the river . The de ##cor is very de ##co which was so much fun . The bed and the furnishings were very comfortable . We had free internet but I am a Kim ##pton Ka ##rma member so I ' m not sure if it ' s free for everyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was in a per ##fa ##ct location , we walked mostly everywhere . Easy access to public transportation . The hotel was very nice , our room was per ##fa ##ct . Everyone was nice and very helpful . . Would stay there again . I highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this hotel Be ##c we wanted a room with an excellent view of the river . It did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! Pro ##s 1 . Excellent room with a view . 2 . The beds were big , the pillows were comfortable , and the sheets were amazing ##ly soft . We just loved it ! 3 . They had a very fast check in . We were picking my mom from the airport and had travelled early to avoid the rush and we were able to check in early at this hotel , too ! 4 . The staff members were very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . 5 . This is just a 5 - minute ride to Millennium station via U ##ber . If I remember right , 30 minutes to O ' Hare airport as well . Con ##s 1 . There was not tooth ##brush or tooth ##pas ##te . Overall : Absolutely loved my experience at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel is op ##ulent in an old style . The rooms have been updated and are standard Hilton level rooms . Location is te ##rri ##fic and an easy walk to the Art Institute , Field museum and slightly longer to the Navy Pier . Reason for the rating is the misleading advertising for the hotel , which I am not sure is a problem from the hotel or from Or ##bit ##z where I booked . Book ##ing said free W ##i ##F ##i , but turns out it is only free in the lobby or if your are a Hilton Honors member who booked through the Hilton website . The amenities also list pool and fitness but these are a separate charge . Again , all this would have been fine if we knew that going in but to not disc ##lose these left a bad taste in our mouths . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont rooms are comfortable and well appointed , and house ##keeping is very good . I was disappointed with the slow elevators which can ' t keep pace with large conference traffic , and the decline in room service food quality and options . Lac ##k of a small hotel convenience shop is annoying , although C ##VS is across the street , and convenience stores are available in the underground retail system . The location is good , convenient to both the Loop and Michigan Ave . , but for the price other hotels are offering more amenities and a better overall experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 4 nights , loved the room with 2 bathroom ##s as it makes it easier when traveling with 4 people , was worth the extra small charge per night to upgrade . Location is excellent for the museum campus , and manage ##able walk to Willis Tower , and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Staff is very friendly and helpful , restaurants in the hotel are okay and are in the high side for prices . Room ##s are clean , depending on which side of building your room is on , can hear the train going by . Across from part of Grant Park . Very large hotel , over 1 , 500 rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the She ##rato ##n Grand for a business conference and had a very good experience . The hotel is located in a great area with things to do . But Connie who takes care of the lounge on the 33rd floor made me feel at home the whole time I was there . Even after food was cleaned up she went back and got me a plate of what was left . On a few occasions she even made sure I left with plenty of snack ##s . Her hospitality is the reason why I will keep coming back here . Made me feel like this was home away from home . I travel a lot for work and have never felt so welcome every time I came to get a few waters and snack ##s . The great thing is that she does this with all of the guests and makes everyone smile and laugh . You will not be disappointed when staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect for relaxing after business meetings . Room with com ##fy King bed , free w ##if ##i , included couch , standing desk and fridge . Staff was friendly and easily reach ##able by text . B ##fast included - available on each floor near elevator so quite convenient . Dec ##ent selection of yo ##gu ##rt , bread ##s , past ##ries . Happy hour was a lovely touch . Free drink per day and nice selection of finger food / snack ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , very clean , and free W ##i - Fi . Great location as well . They do have free coffee but only super early in the morning . The door ##men were very nice and friendly . The room came with a mini fridge , unlike the W . [SEP]
1	[CLS] To rate this hotel as " average " would be misleading but the standard room is really too small to be functional ##ly comfortable . I ' m 5 ' 2 " and pet ##ite and barely could move around the room , let alone use the bathroom comfortably . The de ##cor is g ##lam and the lobby makes you feel f ##abulous but the room is really a g ##lor ##ified closet . As a Kim ##pton member , the mini ##bar credit is nice but difficult to use since so many of the items are e ##g ##re ##gio ##us ##ly over ##p ##rice ##d . However , if your company allows you to expense it or money is not an issue or you simply find a great deal , don ' t hesitate in booking this hotel . It ' s better suited for the solo travel ##er or the business travel ##er who doesn ' t plan on spending much time in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked 3 rooms for our family trip to celebrate our 45th anniversary . Our room was a suite which was perfect for gathering to visit . The rooms were lovely , exceptionally clean , superior details and comfortable . Great location for dining and shopping . Will be returning on upcoming trips . [SEP]
1	[CLS] D ##wayne was awesome ! He is very persona ##ble and at ##ten ##tive the second you walk in the doors ! He has a very positive energy which makes you feel comfortable and well taken care of during you stay at the ta ##l ##bot ##t . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What an amazing hotel So ##fit ##el is . Everything is just picture perfect . What you see in the pictures at booking is how it really looks ! ! ! The views are amazing . The colors complement each other with so ##fi ##st ##ification . The staff is very at ##ten ##tive and court ##eous . The rooms are extremely clean . I would say they have topped the Conrad ! ! ! ! You will love the automatic d ##rap ##es too ! ! ! En ##joy ! Excellence ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Old fashion style hotel , good service and bar . The location is great but the rooms a little bit small for am ##eric ##an standards . You can walk for a lot of shops and restaurants as well to the lake , at summer time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed 5 days last week at this property and I had a great experience . In addition , I forgot some very important documents in the safe of my room . Karen Mo ##y and her team located the documents and are returning them to me . They communicated very well with me during the whole process and did an excellent job . T ##HA ##N ##K YOU [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a perfect weekend hotel close to parks and shopping ! The hotel is clean and modern with a friendly staff . We chose a room with two bathroom ##s which was great for the four of us . So close to Grant and Mill ##ine ##um parks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice rooms , good staff . Connie in the Club Lounge was particularly good . I checked in Sunday night ( March 26 ) and stopped by the lounge . There was a mother with a handful of kids in the lounge and the kids were running wild while the mother seemed disconnected from controlling the kids . Connie dealt with the situation with calm and restraint that was ad ##mir ##able while still doing her best to create a good experience for the other guests . I was very impressed with how she handled a very difficult situation - thanks , Connie ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel lobby is gorgeous and the rooms do what you need . But I wouldn ’ t stay here again . Upon getting to our room , it was hot - 75 degrees ! We instantly turned it down and by morning we had it set to 65 , but out most definitely was not that cold . The first glass we picked up had tooth ##pas ##te cake ##d on it . They sly ##ly hand you a piece of paper at check ##in saying there is a $ 20 “ amenities fee ” in addition to the room rate that covers a bunch of stuff you have to pay for anyway . Not sure why that isn ’ t part of the cost of the room , and you can ’ t op ##t out . Finally the elevators around check ##out time were insane . We waited over five minutes before we took the stairs [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has a great location just feet off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , with very reasonable prices . The rooms are beautiful and the service is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . I have stayed 3 times and will definitely be back next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##pen ##sive for the night . No fridge , nowhere to store my kids milk and food . parking in ##con ##ven ##ient if you have to drag two to ##ddler ##s in the middle of the night . Ok view if the city . Bath ##room clean , beds cleaned , [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for the first time and loved it ! Great location and beautiful views of the city . Love ##d the continental breakfast . Con ##cier ##ge Melissa was very helpful . Will def ##inate ##ly return to the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having stayed at the Kim ##pton Pa ##lo ##mar the previous week we opted to the Monaco for our second week . A great refurbished building , lots of character and well appointed rooms . The Kim ##pton beds are so comfortable . So much added bonus ##es from Kim ##pton including the free wine hour from 5 ##pm to 6 ##pm every night ( every hotel ) , free bike hire which we took advantage of and their front of house always very helpful . We must comment that a negative is their bars in both Baltimore and Chicago did not accommodate post ball game residents . We stayed in Baltimore last summer and returned after the ball game to find the bar shut , exactly the same thing in the Monaco this July . Get it sorted Kim ##pton , at least stay open until 11 ##pm ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked here for our first night in Chicago as I couldn ’ t get an extra room at She ##rato ##n Grand on the river . We didn ’ t eat here but used the bar that was nice and busy with many friendly and chat ##ty locals . We did pop over the shop at the end of the street for water and noticed that the area the Hotel is in was a little rough so evening walks would be out of the question as it ’ s not on any main streets . Our room was quite small as well so for $ 161 per night I think was way over priced but it was clean and that really does matter . We would stay there again as the better Hotels are on the River but it wasn ’ t bad , just a little over priced for us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a week during the 2014 N ##RA show last year , and really enjoyed it . Room was huge , bathroom was fit for a king ! Just a stones throw from the Trump Tower and other cool buildings , location wise brilliant . Would recommend , especially for a romantic get ##away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is tucked away from the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le of the downtown shopping area but still within walking distance . The subway is a block away . There is Te ##mpo Cafe serving comfort food in huge portions next to the hotel , and a grocery store around the corner . There are many other restaurant choices steps away . I was pleasant ##ly surprised to find a spacious room , especially the bathroom which comes with a bath ##tub and a separate shower stall . There is no need to pay extra for a room in the higher floors . The rooms are very quiet . A very enjoyable stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We took advantage of Hilton Honors " Christmas in July " special and booked rooms last summer for the holiday season . We had ex ##ped ##ited check in , very good service from the staff . Love ##d the swinging car ##ole ##rs in the bar . B ##UT our king room was small , paint pretty din ##ged up , and stuff ##y . I wish I would have taken advantage of the upgrade or booked a room with double beds . Free breakfast was part of the deal , but lines at the restaurant made this difficult . Very off putting to see a long line spilling out when you desperately need coffee ! In general , the hotel seemed liked it couldn ' t keep up with the crowds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gorge ##ous Hotel , love the antique of this hotel . . . . Staff was friendly and helpful , room was clean , bed com ##fy , and shower was great . " Close to everything and walking distance down the main road . . . Lots of shops in the area [SEP]

0	[CLS] The hotel was ok , I was expecting a far higher quality of room for the price I paid and the star rating . The service we all received was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , con ##ce ##ir ##ge very helpful and everyone else we met offered good service . Beautiful pool . The main issue for me with this hotel was the rooms , they were old fashioned , dated , dark and needed maintenance - far below what I expected from this type of hotel . When I complained I got moved to a nice ##r room but still felt unhappy with the other room my parents stayed in . The health f ##ac ##ili ##tes are good and breakfast was delicious and p ##lent ##iful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very Nice Hotel , very well located . Will the bell boys is very helpful with good advice . Our room was very comfortable , clean , service made every morning no waiting . Bath ##room little sa ##m ##l but very nice . I recommended this hotel to anyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] PR ##Os : location ( one of the most elegant areas of Chicago , away from Michigan Avenue - at walking distance , though ) ; fine rooms and splendid re ##in ##vention of its lobby , bar and restaurant area . Great food ; kind guys at v ##alet parking ; unique atmosphere , day and night . CO ##N ##s : self - awareness of a large number of employees is something that stands out . the place is famous , hosts celebrities , displays a wonderful bout ##ique hotel design and they know that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an amazing weekend at the Fair ##mont Gold - truly felt p ##amp ##ered . We stayed in a Gold suite which had the most amazing view of Millennium Park . We were there with our three kids ( all under 5 ) and had plenty of room with the provided c ##ri ##b . We spent a lot of time in the Gold lounge relaxing , playing board games and eating ! It was both me and my son ' s birthday and a huge cup ##cake was sent to our room in celebration . Also , my kids loved the freshly baked cookies in the Gold lounge in the afternoon , and sure enough that evening before bed , a tray of those cookies and milk were sent to our room ! The staff went above and beyond our expectations . We are planning to come back next year . . . if not sooner ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve been to Chicago over a dozen times and rarely decide to stay in a luxury hotel , but two weeks ago I decided to try something new . I am glad I did ! The room was spectacular and so comfortable yet luxurious , and I really felt like I made the right decision . Aside from the amenities , I also really appreciated the kind staff . While everyone was wonderful , I particularly enjoyed a bell ##man who helped me out named Is ##ma ##eel ! This young man so warm , friendly and funny I instantly felt like I already knew him . On top of that , he did an excellent job with my bags . Just a great example of the quality staff at The Ambassador ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located in Downtown , short walk to parks and museums . The rapid transit runs next door . The North ##end of Route 66 is two blocks away . Staff is very helpful and the restaurant is very good , excellent Bar . Room ##s are little tired and small . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location , just off the Main Street in Chicago . Bed ##rooms are small but have all you need , nice and clean . Staff are really friendly and there is a nice bar in the reception of the hotel . The gym is small but once again has all you need . I have been on a bicycle ride along the lake , to the beach , to the bean , shopping of course and they are all so accessible from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No ##is ##y , walls are thin , rooms are small but clean . Front desk un ##friend ##ly . I had a King corner Suite but it did not look like the one on the site . F ##als ##e advertisement . Great location , easy access to restaurants , shopping . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Having a nice view , especially for an extended stay , is very important to me . When I made my reservation , I made note of this . Because I was getting in late , I was afraid that the rooms with a nice view would be gone . I contacted the hotel in the morning to remind the front desk of my concern . When I arrived , the hotel reception ##ist was Rachel who was extremely helpful . I ended up with a great view looking at the Chicago River with multiple bridges and many of the famous buildings that are representative of the Chicago School of Architecture . Thanks again to Rachel for helping to make my 5 days in Chicago memorable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency is in a f ##abulous location . Our room was large , clean , comfortable , and had everything you need ! I would have preferred to have an empty refrigerator to one that was stock ##ed for over ##p ##rice ##s purchases , but I get it . It was quite expensive , but probably comparable to other hotels in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I took 3 nights away and stayed at Hotel Monaco . The staff was extremely friendly , as were all the others we encountered at the hotel . The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming . The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable . The location of the hotel is awesome . We took advantage of the hotel bikes to cover more area . You can cycle for miles along the lake . Absolutely no reason for a car if staying here and planning on hanging out in the city . We would easily stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve been coming to Chicago for an annual meeting for many years . Recently , the event moved to the Swiss ##ote ##l . We are very pleased with the venue facilities for meeting rooms , food and bar area for social ##izing . The location is great for dinner meetings at nearby restaurants . And Dan Jack in the event staff is exceptionally re ##sp ##ons ##ive and one of the best in the business . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for my son ' s wedding . Many of the members of the wedding party and close family also stayed here . We were all stressed out and in need of everything from extra lamps and bars ##to ##ols to plastic fork ##s . The staff fulfilled every request and kept our rooms clean and t ##idy all the while . Our best help ##ers were Rosemary Miller and D ##wayne . They made it a great stay during a busy time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I traveled here on business , so I am unsure of how much it cost , but it was clean and within walking distance to River ##walk , Miracle Mile shopping and great pizza . If you can , stay in the West Wing . The view was awesome if you ’ re facing the river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed there for three days . Very nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff . Great location and easy to travel around , either by foot or with U ##ber . Hotel bar was good and the bartender ##s sure knew how to make a mean g ##in and ton ##ic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town from Toronto for weekend of ball games . Dec ##ided to try the Conrad based on reviews . We were not disappointed . Very friendly and helpful staff . Room was large and well appointed . Bed ##s were very comfortable . Bath ##room was large . Lo ##ads of storage space . Hu ##ge t ##v . Love ##d the automatic blind ##s and light controls . Con ##cier ##ge gave restaurant recommendations and we were not disappointed . Located a block from Michigan Avenue which made it very easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go . Only down ##side was house ##keeping , they were a little lacking on attention to details - rest ##ock ##ing fridge ( executive room ) and toilet ##ries and left behind some trash . But not big enough issues to give a lower rating . If in Chicago again would stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the fair ##mont Millennium Park for 4 days with a great experience ! The room was clean and the restaurant made great food . The hotel was convenient ##ly located near The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and Millennium Park , so walking was pretty easy . To get to farther destinations , U ##ber was very easy because drivers could pick up right outside the hotel on the street . I would recommend this hotel to everyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited Chicago for a long weekend . We choose this hotel because of price point and location to many sights . Easy access to the train ( subway ) and walking distance to the bean , Grant Park , etc . Pro ##s : location , at ##ten ##tive room cleaning , fast elevators , mini fridge , friendly staff . Con ##s : bed a bit too soft , bathroom on the small side - although it ’ s updated , staff protest going on outside the main entrance ( we were told it was getting resolved soon ) . Hotel offers a breakfast for an additional fee , we did not eat any meals at the hotel . In the future , I would definitely shop around and see if I could find a similar hotel nearby . Nothing special to make me want to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great establishment . . . pet friendly . This was a business visit , the rooms were clean and comfortable . The restaurant was p ##ric ##y but if you ' re staying here you probably are not worried about that . . . the rooms are also on the higher end . The location pits you smack in walking distance or short cab ride to all attractions and airport . . . You will not be di ##sa ##point ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Fair ##mont Millennium Park for a business trip . Man ##dan ##a in the Gold Club on the 15th Floor was amazing . She somehow remembered everyone ' s face and what they were most likely to want to drink . . . w ##ow . Can ' t wait to visit again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A beautiful new hotel well situated in downtown Chicago . Very comfortable bed , great TV offerings , beautifully appointed bathroom with shower . Fine staff . Friendly and personal service . For us however , very expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] very con ##vie ##nt and comfortable . staff was wonderful and the food and beverage service excellent . we attend a con ##fer ##ience every year in ch ##ica ##go , this is the first time at the h ##ya ##tt re ##gen ##cy , but it won ##t be our last . [SEP]
1	[CLS] this location is perfect rush and mi ##chi ##gan a ##ve just a few feet away . train across the street and bus stop at the corner . across the street from p ##f ch ##ang and one block from web ##er g ##rill and rock bottom brewing . can easily walk to all the stores on mi ##chi ##gan or down to the navy pier . mill ##eni ##um park is also a short walk . breakfast every morning which is pretty basic but convenient . dinner mon ##day th ##ru th ##urs ##day . . . also basic but convenient also . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment we stepped foot at this hotel we were taken care of . Great customer service , very clean , all the amenities you could ever need and the perfect location ! This will be our home away from home from now on , can ' t wait to come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in the past and service / rooms were me ##dio ##cre . . . not bad not great . Had to do another trip and received a great email offer for the con ##cier ##ge floor club gold . For the right price we upgraded and immediately got a great con ##cier ##ge check in before our trip . Mad ##ona was amazing at breakfast our private assistant mug ##i assisted with all our con ##cier ##ge needs and even did an elaborate tea demo with their manager Corey . Gold staff all around was good to great and we had a great stay this time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel ! Perfect ##ly clean , big room , huge comfortable bed , nice relaxing sleeping . Nice bar , quite good restaurant . A couple of occasions the bar was not available due to private events . Perfect ##ly located if you want r ##o visit the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and if you want to have great shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a 4 day business trip . Hotel is quite new and modern . Room ##s are a good size and beds very comfortable . G ##ym reasonably well equipped with very modern machines . Restaurant ok but a bit price ##y for the food they offer . Limited dinner options , but lots of alternatives in the surrounding streets . Overall a good quality hotel and I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , view to the river and customer service were amazing . The only draw ##back is the somewhat older building , which of course is typical for downtown Chicago . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great spot with great service ! Steps from Michigan Ave shopping and many wonderful restaurants . Fitness center was well done and has lots of options . Looking forward to trying the rooftop restaurant / bar in warmer weather . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful , clean . Fast and efficient check in . Large lobby . Re ##fill water station by the reception desk ##s . Indoor Market with reasonably priced salad ##s and sandwiches . The only slightly negative experience was the lady at the Con ##cier ##ge desk was busy on the phone when I stopped by . I stood there for about 10 min and she never made eye contact with me , smiled , or acknowledge my presence in anyway . I finally gave up and walked away . Another customer came by and also was ignored . Even though she was busy on the phone , a little eye contact and smile would have indicated that she acknowledged the customer ' s presence . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wanted to see Chicago because I had never been there before . My friend I invited got us tickets to see Hamilton . We didn ' t know Lo ##lla ##pol ##lo ##oz ##a was that weekend . It made for some interesting people watching . Shopping on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile was amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very central to many downtown restaurants and the red line which takes you to W ##rig ##ley in 15 min . Around the corner is the ex ##pan ##sive Eat ##aly which you might want to check out for dinner . We also ate at Ma ##stro ' s St ##eak ##house at 520 N Dear ##born . Great place , entertainment in the lounge area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Rep ##ulse ##d by the relentless so ##licit ##ation to buy times ##hare vacation packages ! It started at check - in and continued by elevators , lobby , coffee shop , etc , D ##A ##IL ##Y throughout entire 3 day stay . Please allow a guest to at least get into their room before trying to s ##wind ##le more money out of them ! This is not hospitality or a practice I would expect from a name like Hilton . On the plus side , the location is good and the hotel has historical significance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice and clean . Updated . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and did everything possible to make our stay pleasant . The room with two beds seemed a little small so we changed our minds at check in and got a king room . Very nice . Room ##y . Two comfortable side chairs . Very comfortable bed and pillows . The con ##cier ##ge Willie was very knowledge ##able and available to answer our questions as to where restaurants , shopping , and sights were . They kept our bags after check ##out until we left for the airport . Staff was excellent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was probably the no ##isi ##est hotel I ' ve ever stayed in ! I know its Michigan Avenue but they really need to sound proof their rooms ! ! ! And whatever you do , don ' t stay in the old section of the hotel - its dark , de ##pressing and has a rank smell . The newer section is more acceptable but its very dated and ordinary . You can hear sire ##ns and horns 24 hours a day ! ! ! There ' s no club lounge here for I ##H ##G guests . All of the staff seem tired , i ##rri ##table and di ##sin ##ter ##ested . There ' s very few benefits for Royal Ambassador guests . Overall a very disappointing and un ##in ##vi ##ting hotel - so much potential but nothing else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was good but sheets weren ' t the soft ##est . Good location near museums and shopping . Hotel was clean . Lake ##view room offered a beautiful view especially in the morning during sunrise . Would stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] My teenage ##d daughter and I stayed at Hotel All ##egro over Memorial Day Weekend as we were in town for a conference . Pro ##s : At ##ten ##tive customer service , clean , hot water and nice toilet ##ries in the bathroom , decent amenities on site , good location in the middle of the theatre district . Con ##s : Very small room , Bed was hard as a rock Overall , it was a fine accommodation especially for the rate we paid . We had an issue with loud / screaming neighbors and customer service immediately handled it and we never heard a p ##eep from that point onward . Honestly the only reason I rated very good rather than excellent was the hard beds . Both my daughter and I woke with back pain each morning because of the uncomfortable beds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place has gone down hill . First and foremost there is no pool here . So they have some major false advertising on apps like price ##line stating there is a pool . Food is stupid expensive for room . Service . An example , a salad will run you 20 bucks and simple chicken tender ##s are the same price . Fr ##ies are 9 bucks . Also . When I checked in , I had to change rooms due to the room light bulb ##s not working , dead bugs on walls when they where killed . The bar is not open either . This place blows . It ' s run down g ##hetto and you will be paying 4 . 5 star prices . I stayed for 4 days 3 nights and that was around 700 bucks . A week after the 4th of July . You would think its kinda off holiday and season to get a decent deal but ye ##a that was also false . Last time I ' m coming here for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff were very helpful , v ##alet parking was excellent . The room had a river view which was great . The weather was unusually cold for the time of year so we didn ' t do much outdoors . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I didn ' t know what to expect from the hotel since it will be my first time to stay with Swiss ##ote ##l and I was not disappointed . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The room was so big and have over supply of amenities . What I love most was that they have an offer to give you if you want to op ##t not to have your room cleaned . . . very practical and beneficial not only to them but to their guest and to the environment . Their location is so accessible to ever ##thing and we do not have to worry about how to get anywhere . I am also impressed with their staff especially Bernard of the con ##cier ##ge . He was so helpful ##l giving me directions and best places to see . The front desk staff did their job very well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] For our first visit in Chicago , my wife and i spent 3 nights at this Hotel in first week end of f ##eb ##ru ##ary . An hotel with a lot of history and really well spot right downtown . About few minutes walking from House of Blues , a lot of typical Chicago restaurants , ( Also a real good one in the Hotel ) . We spent the week end walking downtown , and lo ##od at the really beautiful architecture around there . Also , few minutes from principal attraction in Chicago , as the cloud , the sky ##de ##ck , The pier and many other activities . You will need more than 3 days to visit all the attraction around this Hotel . The room are a little bit old and would need some re ##f ##resh but really clean and con ##fort ##able . If you like to be near downtown life , and shopping , you have to be at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was very large , had a bath and a separate shower . I had a corner room with views of the lake and of the river . It was very quiet , had a comfortable bed and a large TV . It was easy to control the heating system . Show ##er had good pressure and the bathroom amenities ( soap ##s , s ##ham ##po ##o , body lot ##ion , etc ) were of very good quality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All the staff were wonderful . We upgraded to a Delaware Street view room - definitely worth the extra cost . Clean and comfortable . Great location right near Michigan Ave . Our only negative was is that we were only able to stay one night . We will return for a longer stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our “ go to ” and “ stay at ” near luxury hotel in Chicago . We have had mini - family reunion ##s here for holidays where family can fly in or drive in . The rooms are all suites which is nice when one of us wants to nap and the other compose T ##A reviews . . . Some of the rooms are a bit tired . Small things include an automatic coffee maker with decent coffee . Um ##bre ##llas this weekend were a great touch given the d ##riz ##zle ! We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This very nice hotel in downtown Chicago is walking distance from Millennium Park , River Walk , and Willis Tower is about 26 min ##s away . Our room is comfortable for a family of 4 people . There are good restaurants specially along Michigan Avenue which is 2 blocks away . Ask ##s for a room on upper floors for nice view of Chicago . The hotel have taxi ##s waiting on the corner if want to go somewhere and don ’ t want to walk . It ’ s an alternative to paying one of those hop on / off buses or U ##ber . Only thing not too happy about this hotel is the breakfast b ##uff ##et was a bit too price ##y . Other than that it ’ s a hotel I will definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here with my husband for a quick get ##away weekend . Hotel is in a great location for shopping , casual eating , theater , etc . I contacted the con ##cier ##ge to have some food / wine brought to our room so it would be there upon arrival ( late check in ) and all was as planned . I would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had girls get ##away at this A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E hotel . Free happy hour , very com ##fy beds , large bathroom and coffee / continental breakfast compliment ##ary on our floor each morning . Drake and Gerry at the front desk were super friendly and helpful with getting us dinner reservations . Great location a block off Michigan Ave . Hotel room was im ##ma ##culate and large . Vale ##t parking attendant was speed ##y in getting my car at check ##out . I will definitely stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie the next time I am in Chicago for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stopped for a weekend in Chicago . The suite type room we rented was huge and class ##y . The modern feel and premium furnishings made our stay perfect . The location is in the heart of the magnificent mile . There is shopping , restaurants , museums , and the beach all walking distance . The staff are a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . A great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I took advantage of an excellent offer and enjoyed a nice luxury stay ##cation for Christmas Eve . We usually stay at R ##itz ##C ##ar ##lton , St Regis , Four Seasons or And ##az properties , so this was our first Conrad stay . It was excellent . Interior design of the room and common spaces were very much our style , in - room dining was great and the service was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely hotel . Most of staff was wonderful , especially Erin who happily accommodate ##d my requests for pillows and ice . She went above and beyond and did it with a smile . My room was comfortable and clean . Located perfectly within walking distance to many restaurants and stores . The compliment ##ary evening reception food was pretty good with a variety of food options , beer and wine . The compliment ##ary breakfast was just okay . Standard bread ##s , o ##at ##me ##al , bacon and scrambled eggs . Whole fruits were also available . I will certainly look to stay here again next time I am in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in room 122 ##8 which is a corner king . It was large , comfortable and quiet . We stayed a week and it was nice having the extra room which included a small changing area by the closet . The bathroom was a pleasant surprise with a lovely rain shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Me and my family stayed at this hotel July 3rd . And we truly loved this hotel for its beautiful d ##é ##cor , great location by the Chicago river and very close to Navy pier . We had taken a room facing the river and enjoyed the views very much so . We used She ##rato ##n restaurant and the food was decent . We also used sa ##una and pool . Sur ##p ##rising ##ly though for this luxury hotel , there was not a hot tub which was kind of disappointing . Front desk staff was very court ##eous . I definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always stay at the Hilton on South Michigan Avenue with our children , because of its location to the park and the She ##d A ##qua ##rium . There ’ s a great swimming pool and a work ##out facility in the hotel . The hotel lobby is very nice and our room was clean and decorated nicely . Friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We reserved 4 rooms for a trade Show , paid the 1st night for the deposit . 3 of the rooms checked in on the agreed upon date , 1 did not . When the last room checked in the next day , we were told is was not available and the reservation was cancelled . The Hotel was “ sold out ” no rooms available except for 1 night . We were left to find accommodation ##s by ourselves . Staff was not interested in helping us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the So ##fit ##el is just perfect , the staff is very court ##eous and efficient the con ##cier ##ge desk particularly helpful . The suite was great and we definitely recommend the upgrade , it is really Worth it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is one of the best hotels I ’ ve ever stayed in — and I ’ ve stayed in a lot of hotels . The rooms are so spacious which is so unusual for a city . It had great closet ##s so it ’ s perfect for an extended stay . The toilet ##ries provided were really nice which is appreciated . The gym is f ##abulous and they have free water bottles on all of the equipment which is a nice touch . Having a good gym while on the road is really important to us . They even had a power plate machine . We spend a lot of time in hotels so these extra touches were really nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This beautiful hotel is located by the river . It happened to be beside the spot I was going for business but it would be convenient for any stay . The staff there are friendly and very helpful . My room was nice with everything necessary for a comfortable stay . I had room service a couple of times . Food was delicious and was delivered at the minimum time I ' d been given . The Lo ##bs ##ter Roll was great ! I also ate in the restaurant and would highly recommend it . Oh . . . silly of me , I know , but I loved my [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently drove up for a long weekend with our pre ##school / elementary age kids . We found our room a great size and convenient for having a separate area for them to play while we cooked , were online , etc . The rooms were fairly quiet for being in middle of town . We did have a few outlets that were not working . Staff was friendly and helpful . Park ##ing was price ##y but also convenient and took the stress out of figuring out to do with your vehicle . We used the pool and ate the breakfast . All met our needs . Walking distance to nearly anything you ’ d want . We would definitely come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cars ##arra checked us in and in no time at all we were in our wonderful room with two bathroom ##s . Would you believe ? Brandon at the door was very helpful with directions for our rental car return . Thanks . We shall be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ty ##rell is the worst most in ##com ##pet ##ent di ##s ##res ##pect ##ful customer service agent i have ever met in my entire life . He is rude beyond belief . The entire front desk staff are in ##com ##pet ##ent and di ##s ##res ##pect ##ful . I have be ##aver been so di ##s ##res ##pect ##ed at any place I have ever stayed at . I would never recommend anyone to come here . Pay ##ing $ 400 a night for a standard room and getting treated as if this was some Mo ##tel 8 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed one night in a superior king room . Check in and check - out were pro ##mpt and pleasant and our room was comfortable with a great bed & shower . We attended a wedding reception in the lovely ballroom where the food and drinks were outstanding . We wish we could have stayed longer ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room the ##rm ##ost ##at was set at 72 degrees . Impossible to make it higher , it returned to 72 setting after few minutes . Very cold in the room . Good hotel otherwise : clean room and very good location ( Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ) . Re ##ception on the 3rd floor , need to use two elevators to get to your room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room , view of the river . I ##dea ##lly located bring able to walk to shops , transport & restaurants . Very helpful con ##cier ##ge who have coup ##ons & discount ##s for many local attractions & Rest ##ua ##rant ’ s . Hu ##ge hotel with many conferences being Tom but did not interfere with our stay [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have never stayed at a hotel which had such an exceptional staff . Everyone was very friendly and helpful . Our suite was clean and very comfortable . It had a nice pool area , which the children really enjoyed . The compliment ##ary breakfast and social time were enjoyed by adults and children alike . This is a great place to stay when visiting Chicago . We will certainly return . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel really made the case for staying in an Air ##b ##n ##b . For the price I paid and being a Hilton property I just expected more and was disappointed upon checking into my room . The rooms are tiny , dark , and showing their age . My room was minimal at best - not even having a coffee maker . I was in town for the Chicago marathon and it was really close to the starting line but that was about the only thing that impressed me about my stay here . I would op ##t to stay somewhere else and come to the Palmer house for a drink in the lobby , it ’ s beautiful and worth seeing . If you do end up booking here make sure to sign up for the Hilton rewards program if you want to be treated like more than a second class customer by the front desk staff [SEP]
1	[CLS] Home ##wood delivered as usual with nice rooms , warm clean pool , and a great b ##uff ##et at breakfast and evening social . The location is perfect , especially in February , you can walk to a great deal of restaurants , and the parking garage is steps away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The de ##cor is a little dark for my taste , but the bed is like a cloud and water pressure is like a fire ##house , which are the two most important aspects of any hotel . Being a k ##im ##pton ka ##rma member adds in free W ##i ##F ##i and a $ 10 mini ##bar credit making this a great stay . Personal ##ly I wouldn ’ t choose this for a romantic weekend , it ’ s too dark and the lobby on the second floor makes an under ##state ##d welcome . For work , or meetings bags in the Loop , however , this is a great choice and the price is often very competitive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel staff treated me like family and made me feel at home . All of my questions were answered quickly with a smile attached . Food was good and the experience was great ! Would stay with O ##m ##ni every time I could get to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was fantastic . Staff and service was great . Room ##s had a lot of space and everything was laid out nicely . I felt very secure in this hotel . Everything was up - to - date . Love ##d everything about my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very new and more towards the ups ##cale . Modern de ##cor . We stayed two nights w / our kids , felt very welcome . Great location for shopping and popular restaurants . Excellent service . Room ##s have ups ##cale amenities and the rooms were very quiet for being in the city . No pool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##able stay , friendly staff - b ##uff ##et breakfast was worth the trip in the morning . Nice comfortable suite , very clean . Very good door service . Good value for what you pay for . I would stay at this O ##m ##ni our next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at the Conrad in Chicago . The staff was great and really made us feel welcome . Our room was perfect and comfortable . The location is great as well . Will definitely return . We ate at the restaurant on the top floor for both breakfast and dinner . Very good ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of the friend ##liest hotel staff ##s in Chicago ! Excellent location , amazing service and dog friendly like all of the Kim ##pton properties . L ##O ##VE this place , especially for the people who work here ! Close to everything , 1 / 2 block from Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a beautifully designed hotel with a luxury bout ##ique feel . I stayed two nights on a business trip and really enjoyed the extra touches like the H ##H upon arrival and luxury sheets . It is also perfectly located for walking around downtown and access to the El and airport train . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is an outstanding hotel with a wonderful staff . Ms Ya ##vis Soto assured that our every expectation was met . A wonderful Chicago lake side location and beautiful facility . I would highly re ##cco ##men ##d this hotel to someone visiting Chicago that would like to enjoy a premier travel experience . Beautiful rooms and again I can ' t stress the excellence of the staff in particular Ms Ya ##vis Soto . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I had a wonderful time at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal . The rooms a spacious and up - to - date . Everything was very clean . They also have a Star ##bu ##cks connected to the lobby . Vale ##t service was $ 75 a day , which is a bit price ##y , but the closest public garage was a couple blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is in need of maintenance but a great stay for the price and in a good location . Car ##pet ##s were a bit worn and the bathroom showed r ##ust on some of it ' s fixtures and seemed to be barely cleaned . I wore socks in my room just in case . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just got back and loved loved this hotel , staff was amazing and the hospitality was top notch . Everyone was very at ##ten ##tive and always had a smile . Great del ##i market less then a block away , and so many good restaurants close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly and helpful staff , and large rooms . W ##if ##i is very slow and no business office . Free wine happy hour is nice . Not ##ice ##able dust under bureau was disco ##nce ##rting but rest of room was very clean . Location was good as we could walk to theater and quality restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for the weekend . It was a G ##RE ##AT location close to many bars and places to eat . Room ##s were nice , phone did not work to call and the v ##alet service was very slow on Sunday . Staff was polite and had food every morning on all floors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d my time here . The location is better than I had hoped . It was right there by everything or easy to get to everything . The room was nice and well kept . The staff was friendly and helpful . There were still some CO ##VI ##D restrictions in place so I cannot speak to the dining or bar like I would like to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed just for a couple nights on a quick trip . We had a lake view room and the sights and sunrise ##s were amazing . The room was clean and co ##zy . There is a tablet in the room that you can take with you for help guiding yourself around the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel in the heart of Chicago . Professional staff and excellent amenities . Dec ##ore a little tired but well made up for in excellent service . The Fair ##mont gold service was excellent as usual . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a repeat visit next trip to Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location and service . Ex ##er ##cise equipment and w ##im ##ming pool were fantastic . Room service was quick and all food and drink items were well prepared . Had fun walking the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and the river walk . Excellent value and plan to visit again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been visiting this wonderful hotel since 2015 , and my experience here has been perfect . The executive club lounge is an beautiful experience . Since you have a lady that works here name Connie that is so nice and makes you feel like you are at home here . Excellent views and refined rooms makes for an pleasant experience . Thank you She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at Swiss ##ote ##l was a pleasure to work with . The conference room was clean and bright and the staff was at ##ten ##tive to our every need . Their catering staff is top notch as well ! My experience with conference food has been lack lust ##er in the past , but Swiss ##ote ##l prepared meals that all our attendees loved . If you have an event to plan , I highly recommend the staff at Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Do not let the v ##alet park your car ! After charging $ 65 for v ##alet service they were reckless and ne ##gli ##gent in having our new rim ##s severely damaged by scraping against the curb . The hotel manager will not accept responsibility nor assist in re ##ct ##ifying the situation . It is the lack of customer service which is also app ##all ##ing and we are very upset by this . A claim form will be submitted with the 3rd party v ##alet company but P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago is poor at offering any help in re ##sol ##ving our complaint . Un ##p ##ro ##fe ##ssion ##al and we will not recommend a stay at this establishment to anyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here this past weekend for a wedding we were in town for . We were on the 34th floor of the West Tower . You could see the river from our room . The hotel room was larger than I thought it would be . Was clean , bed com ##fy . Pi ##llow ##s weren ' t the best as they are that kind that sinks with your head but I find that fairly common at most hotels and not a specific thing to this hotel . But you cannot go wrong with this location and price was fairly reasonable . Thank you for a wonderful weekend . I ' d definitely consider staying here again if I find myself back in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A pick from the internet turned out great . Get a GO ##LD ##EN room , breakfast , after ##nn ##on snack ##s and after dinner sweet ##s are include ##t . You can walk to many interest ##ng locations . Use a taxi to get a ##rro ##und ( Car rental is about $ 60 . - per day and hotel parking $ 50 . - ) You have $ 110 . - to spend on cab ##s . No worry about parking or how to get where you want to go . The hotel is mid range but better located then some of the more luxury places . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay . The location was excellent and staff were very nice . Excellent gym . Transportation to and from the hotel from O ’ Hare was easy as well . Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile shopping was close by along with multiple great restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 3 nights at the H ##ya ##tt Regency . It ’ s in a great location and we had a river view which you should definitely pay for ! Photo shows view . It ’ s a big hotel with many business guests and didn ’ t see many families but the location suited us . Room ##s are a bit tired and the lighting was awful with only 2 mirrors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for two nights recently on Fair ##mont Gold floor . It was amazing ! The staff , Mu ##gi and Sharon , made sure that I was well cared for , that I had absolutely everything I needed for a comfortable , relaxing , and enjoyable stay . With the exception of going to a conference during the day , I did not need to leave the floor and the incredible lounge and staff . Cody , the Manager , and the woman at breakfast also added to the personal ##ized exceptional experience . I have already booked my next trip and will recommend to anyone visiting Chicago . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] With one exception of the approximate 10 or so staff I encountered on the stay , all were exceptionally polite , helpful , positive . Always ask about room view requests in city hotels - I had a good city view . I didn ' t try the restaurant in lobby level or the bar , but the lower level layout including bar , restaurant , and check in area , is great - very open and attractive . Con ##ven ##ience in easy walking distance if you forget something that hotel can ' t supply . Would stay again if in this area of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family stayed at the Hilton Chicago on our visit for a Cubs game . Located across the street from Lake Michigan . Just minutes from Mill ##ennial Park . Robert did a great job checking us in and explaining the hotel and services . The staff was phenomena ##l ! We enjoyed the breaks ##fast b ##uff ##et as well as app ##eti ##zers in Kitty O ' Shea . The server Dana was super friendly . Guest service is definitely a priority with this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My daughter and I stayed at the Chicago Swiss ##ote ##l in January . I had flown out to be with her after a painful breakup with her boyfriend . The trip was very difficult overall , but it was made so much better by the front desk employee Lane ##tte . When we checked in , Lane ##tte was able to find us a great deal on a beautiful room , but even more so , she took a personal interest in my daughter and her troubles . Trying to make light of things while we were checking in , My daughter asked if the hotel had a " just dumped " discount . Lane ##tte immediately offered her a hug , and then shared sympathy as well as supporting advice . She became my daughter ' s cheer ##leader ! Thank you so very much , Lane ##tte , for making the start of a difficult time in my daughter ' s life better . You made a real difference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My friend and I stayed overnight here . Last year he had a reservation while traveling alone and was une ##x ##ped ##ly upgraded to Room 250 ##1 , the Presidential Suite , which he r ##ave ##d about . We had a reservation for a regular room , but I got into a phone discussion the day ahead with the staff , and mentioned my friend ' s experience , and she said that room was available for a reasonable upgrade . So , I grabbed the opportunity and certainly enjoyed my stay . It is a large suite with a separate bedroom and living area and two bathroom ##s , and is also connected to another guest room on the 25th floor . The de ##cor is rather minimal ##ist , but spacious and comfortable . I could get used to this ! The staff was most g ##rac ##ious and welcoming . Overall , highly pleased with our brief stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ok . I read some of the posts . This is a nice place . Yes the hallway ##s and the rooms are a little out ##dated but it was clean and quiet . The lobby is busy and a little loud but we didn ' t stay in the lobby ! The bell ##men were exceptional - no problem getting taxi ##s or recommendations of restaurants and activities . The con ##cier ##ge desk was very helpful each time we asked questions or for services . The housekeeper ##s were very pleasant . We would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! It ' s convenient to walk to the ma ##g mile , navy pier and lots of restaurants . The rooms are nice and spacious and have the amenities your family will need to stay a few days . They have compliment ##ary breakfast which I didn ' t get around to trying and evening social ##s on some nights with compliment ##ary snack ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d this hotel , good location , , quiet street , day and night , nice co ##sy atmosphere , , nice size room , , staff very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , happy to make the stay comfortable , , would go again and recommend ! ! ! Thank you Talbot ##t ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small rooms but clean and comfortable bed . Got a great rate on hot ##wire last minute . . Under $ 100 / night . Good location but D ##O NO ##T bring your car ! $ 68 / day v ##alet Would stay here again , staff very pleasant and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel and good price Amazing location Excellent service Breakfast was great View was just ok , but we weren ' t in the room long The b ##L ##ack out shades made for a good nights rest so we could explore the city [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed here for a convention in Chicago . Location is one block from the River Walk and a short walk south and onto State Street there is a lot of shopping . Staff was very helpful and nice . The bed was very comfortable , and the room reasonably large . I also liked the fact that my room had a ch ##ais ##e lounge next to the window where I could sit and eat my breakfast while looking out on the street . You are given a tray to grab items from the free continental breakfast laid out on each floor to bring back to your room for consumption . One can have breakfast in bed if you are willing to run down the hall in your p ##aja ##mas to grab the food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] despite the great location and elegant hotel with impressive furnishings , the rooms often noisy corridors . ours was next to a service door that banged through the hall late at night and early in the morning . this is not the staff ' s f ##al ##t - rather a badly laid out hotel , which is really an average hotel ma ##sque ##rading as a fancy hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , excellent amenities and friendly staff . Lots of eat ##eries close ##by and convenient ##ly located near the train station . If you ' re downtown for business or personal trip , you may want to check out this place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ m pet ##ite and can fit in most spaces comfortable , but the bathroom ##s at this hotel are ridiculous ##ly small . Not practical . I felt like I was in the bathroom on a cruise ship . Had no hot water the first day and when I reported it , the front desk associate , said I wasn ’ t the first person to report the issue . Re ##ceived no follow up on the matter , but it did work the next day . The elevators are very slow . Stay on a low floor and use the stairs . It will be faster . I ’ ve stayed at other Kim ##pton ##s and was extremely pleased , but when in Chicago there are better options . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is truly a g ##em . El ##egan ##t , ch ##ic , and luxurious . This landmark hotel is in an exceptional location . ( If Y ##K ##Y ##K ) The staff are absolutely wonderful . Not just because of their high quality of service and discretion , but because they truly look after their guests . I travel a lot , and this type of service is disappearing . They p ##oss ##es a knowledge of the city that is first rate , and work hard to make your stay as sea ##m ##less as possible . I must single out one it ’ s te ##rri ##fic staff members in particular , B ##re , who was delight ##ful . She truly knows the city and had wonderful suggestions . More importantly , They made sure . I was properly looked after . She and her colleagues took wonderful care of me , and are the main reason I will stay here when I am in Chicago . High ##ly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel represents old Chicago . It ' s nice clean , walking distance to shopping . rooms are ok , small . There is no pool , limited am ##ent ##ies . The con ##cer ##ige ##s were great in helping you plan your visit . The staff was wonderful and very friendly . If I went back , I would find something more central ##ly located . Breakfast was o . k . . but expensive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago and it was a wonderful stay . The room was on the 30th level and was super quite and great for a business trip . Hotel is close to many attractions and fantastic restaurants within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here on the way to LA and it was excellent . We had a large dog with us . . . they brought him a dog bed and bowl without us even asking . Room was beautiful and S ##O C ##LE ##AN , beds super comfortable . So perfect especially considering the price . The front desk staff was S ##O great at check ##in . So nice to have people who don ##t hate their no ##bs checking you in . We will be back in ch ##ica ##go for the marathon and already booked our rooms here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful old hotel in an ups ##cale neighborhood in the heart of the Gold Coast ! But what made our trip exceptional was the staff ! ! Our bell ##hop , Wayne , asked why we were in town and we shared that it was to celebrate our 35th Anniversary . He co ##yl ##y arranged an upgrade to a larger room and he and the desk clerk , J ##ac ##qui , also surprised us with a compliment ##ary bottle of wine , straw ##berries with warm chocolate sauce and a $ 25 gift card to the hotel ! What a lovely gesture and delicious too ! All through our stay he would ask us what we were doing next and offer his assistance . Wayne is synonymous with this hotel , a true Ambassador ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the O ##m ##ni Chicago several times and the service has always been top notch . The rooms are very nice , room ##y , and clean . High ##ly recommend the corner suite . Room service is pro ##mpt and food has been very good . The advance check - in and express check - out is fantastic ! Also , the hotel is central ##ly located . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk not particularly helpful , everything seemed to be such an effort for them with basic requests . Good location but to get round the sights without ruin ##ing your legs use the buses / CT ##A train ( get a day pass at the stations to use on both buses and trains ) . Dec ##or a bit past it ' s best but kept reasonably clean . Co ##m ##fy big bed . No free W ##i - Fi in rooms . Bath ##room needed modern ##ising as it was very worn and the shower was just a trick ##le . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Right in the heard of the Chicago theater part of town , this place has a very , old - Hollywood v ##ibe to it . Great bar , have not tried the restaurant yet but I was told it is very good . Room ##s are a bit funk ##y , at least mine is , with a very re ##tro feel to the room . Speaking of the rooms , mine is huge . Nice sized sofa and chair , big TV and com ##fy bed . But the bathroom is T ##IN ##Y ! I basically had to stand on the toilet to s ##have because there is no room between that and the sink . B ##rough ##t to mind some of the hotels I stayed in when in London where space is at an absolute premium . But aside from that , the location is great . Even on a night when it was 18 degrees out , I was able to quickly walk up to Three Dot ##s and a Dash ( see a previous review ) for a class A Mai Tai . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a good hotel which I stayed twice . It is just 2 minutes from the Grand station of Red line , and very close to several bus station , convenient to sights ##ee ##ing for this city . Just one block from the Mi ##cha ##gen Avenue , dining , shopping are very easy . Food for ever ##ing social is good , not just taking a sip . The only issue is that the lift number is 2 , which is not enough for this hotel , in rush time , you have to wait a bit longer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Another great stay at the Monaco last week . This hotel , and Kim ##pton in general , are always well worth ##while ! I ' d like to try the Grey or Pa ##lo ##mar , but usually stay here because of the location . Friendly staff , comfortable beds , de ##cor that is NO ##T cookie cutter , fun social hour with wine in the late afternoon . Will return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location with friendly and helpful staff . Staff in every area was excellent . My grip ##e is with the clean ##liness of my room . Dirty floors and dirty comfort ##er . House ##keeping needs to step it up to make this an excellent hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] The one thing I can say that is 5 stars is the views . If you can , you should upgrade to the water side views instead of the city side . Sunrise in Chicago is a must - see . Our room was on the 20th floor . We had a spectacular view of Lake Michigan and the Chicago River and downtown . The hotel is a bit dated - its from the ' 80 ' s . Its doesn ##t smell or anything like that , but the furniture and the bed was all very ordinary . The hotel is very close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and all of downtown ' s activities . Its close to the Navy Pier , too . I would have given 5 stars if the de ##cor was more updated . All - in - all a nice stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel with great spacious suite rooms . Right on Michigan Ave . with lots of fun & food things to do . Next time in Chicago I will try to use this hotel again . I was there during an exhibition , so it was as usual over ##p ##rice ##d during that time . But that ' s normal in Chicago , so not really a negative thing about the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is the friend ##liest , clean ##est , nice ##st hotel I ' ve been to in a long time ! ! And I ' ve stayed at numerous five star hotels . The staff is great ! They are very helpful . The rooms are wonderful . I will be back soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gorge ##ous , comfortable , awesome blend of modern and historic styles . Co ##m ##fort ##s , luxury beds and service with good price . Staff friendly , helpful well trained . Really clean . Eva Shen was efficient and polite with hotel service and had in - depth advice about all things Chicago . She made our stay that much better ; can ' t get that staying in a private residence . Great location . Dec ##ora ##tive details in this modern hotel make you feel you ' re visiting the best of Europe - some original ceilings etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for our work yearly meeting . The hotel , staff were on point ! Would be happy to stay there anytime . The hotel is beautiful , clean . The meeting rooms were comfortable and the water was kept re ##ple ##nish ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located close to subway , Big Bus Stop , restaurants , John Hancock Tower , Water Tower , and so much more like a 20 minute walk to Navy Pier and 30 minute walk to Mill ##eni ##um Park . The staff was helpful , got early check ##in , late check ##out and luggage storage while we walked the city before too was ready and after check ##out . The rooms were very clean , beds / linen ##s very comfortable , bath robes , slip ##pers , Ke ##uri ##g coffee pot / pod ##s and a water provided . Modern motif . Large and we ##l ##com ##8 ##ng lobby area . Po ##sh stores , bout ##iques , etc . north of hotel . Quiet rooms . Quiet location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Stay ##ed for recent business trip and familiar with area and nearby 5 star hotels . The Talbot ##t Hotel is an excellent choice and excellent location . Near Rush Street , Water Tower area . 5 minute walk to John Hancock and Water Tower Place . Great price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Inc ##red ##ible classic hotel . The lobby and bar area are beautiful and reminiscent of time gone by . G ##igan ##tic painted ceilings . The con ##cier ##ge level serves a nice breakfast and evening snack ##s . We were upgraded to an executive level king . P ##lent ##y of room and nicely appointed . The fitness room has plenty of machines and weights . I ’ m a constant visitor . Great location as well . Right on state and Monroe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I would just like to say that I had an outstanding experience from the moment I arrived ! ! ! I was greeted by K ##wa ##me and Edward at the front desk and they were phenomena ##l and very knowledge ##able . They got me into my room quickly and were able to provide information in regards to the surrounding area . She ##r was great as well when trying to arrange evening events and car services ! ! ! I ' ve stayed at many hotels and this was and experience that in my opinion would be hard to du ##plicate ! ! ! Job well done ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our second time staying at a Kim ##pton hotel . Excellent experience ! We asked for an early check in 2 : 00 pm last 8 / 29 / 15 , front desk was very court ##eous . The v ##alet was pain ##less . Bell ##hop was very friendly . Our room had a great view of the river . Lucy , our dog loved the bay window ! Happy hour , price ##less ! The restaurant is indeed Chicago ' s best kept secret ! Breakfast in the room was sum ##pt ##uous . Love ##d our stay and would stay in this hotel next time we ' re in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was just a fun girls weekend in Chicago to see Hamilton , explore the city . The hotel was perfect for us . You can ' t beat the location ! Great rate , service and property ! Everyone was so nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Our room was on Delaware Place and it was quiet . The rooms are surprisingly spacious . You can walk to almost everything or just a quick U ##ber ride away . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our second stay at the Palmer House . We really like the location . But , this time the bathroom in the room had not been thoroughly cleaned . And the tub drain seemed to be c ##log ##ged or backed up , as the water did not drain well . Additionally , there was dust on the furniture in the room and when I was searching for a missing so ##ck I looked under the bed where I saw c ##rum ##bs and dirt . Next time we visit Chicago we will pick another hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful , the lobby is amazing and the employees were also very nice and helpful . We were there celebrating our Anniversary and couldn ' t p ##f asked for a better stay . We only wish we could of stayed longer . The hotel is nicely located to everything , the views are amazing as well . They have a bar that is so ups ##cale and a new restaurant that opened across the street . At check in they let me know that there will be a $ 125 credit hold ( I was only there one night ) I just forgot to ask how long it will last . We booked through hot ##wire so we paid in advance for the room and were only charged $ 13 at check in . The hotel is so close to the Ma ##g Mile that we shop ##ped and had dinner with out needing a taxi . I definitely recommend this hotel . Everything was amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great location across from the Trump Towers , right off the magnificent mile with access to everything . Park ##ing is additional , can ’ t get around it in Chicago . Love the kitchen ##ette , perfect for our family of 5 we could store g ##ro ##cer ##ies and keep snack ##s . Big rooms . Indoor pool . Will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , for the price , this is a very good hotel . The location is extremely central to shopping and sights . Service was excellent . The room design in my room was a bit funny - the bathroom door swung open into the main hallway in a way that made it awkward if you didn ' t keep the door all the way open or all the way close , but my family member ' s room next door was laid out better . The safe in my room didn ' t work , but didn ' t matter because I just used my family member ' s safe . The beds were very comfortable , and the free wine in the evening is always nice ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the 3rd year in a row that my family has stayed here for our Christmas Family V ##aca ##tion . We would recommend it to any families that are visiting Chicago . . . . . especially during the holiday season . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed my stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago . Great location to walk around for shopping and attractions . Room ##s were excellent and clean and modern . will definitely stay there again . Free fresh coffee in foyer every morning was a god send [UNK] [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I stayed here a couple weeks ago . This is truly a lovely hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago ! We enjoyed the fantastic views of the city and the river , the gorgeous , comfortable , and quiet room , the well - appointed work ##out facility , the top - notch professional and friendly staff , and the ease of checking - in and checking - out . I highly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Amazing experience , highly recommended . Staff was the best I have experienced from the moment I arrived to my departure . The restaurant was amazing , the food was delicious and the wait staff was professional . I will return [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was attending a Me ##rger ##M ##ark ##et s ##ym ##po ##sium in Chicago on Middle Market and Private Equity outlook at this hotel . I was pleasant ##ly surprised how hip this new hotel is in the heart of the loop and next to the Palace Theatre . I would encourage all visitors and residents of the city to check out this new venue . Very welcoming , hip , and areas within to have more private conversations ; I WA ##S I ##MP ##RE ##SS ##ED ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The best trip ever . Hotel was wonderful . Coming back again in two months . De ##fin ##ite ##ly coming back to this same hotel . Location was perfect , next to the beach and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It is also a block away from the 360 Tower . Price was also excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Breakfast was the worse every day we stayed and we stayed 4 days ! The location of the hotel is amazing for popular tourist locations . The overall suites are decent size and the view was amazing from my room of the city ! I love the fact of having a kitchen and mini living room ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a bust ##ling hotel with great service and great rooms . Beautiful view of the river and the lake ! The elevator system is kind of like magic - you enter your desired floor and it assigns you your elevator by letter - got to stay alert ! Room ##s are large and clean with excellent work desk for business travelers and a nice mini fridge for drinks and snack ##s . I highly recommend the beautiful supermarket a short across the park from the " back door " of the hotel - Mariano ' s - a full service grocery story with f ##abulous salad bar and other prepared foods . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel location is great but I was told due to their online pricing policy , the hotel sells out and they WA ##L ##K customers to another hotel . When I got there they said o ##ops we sold out and have to put you in a room next to a family ( noisy kids ) and zero upgrades and the breakfast area was PA ##C ##KE ##D with people ( had to go eat outside the hotel ) and the food was really cheap and re ##heat ##ed from a packet , bag or box . Not a good hotel , just a good location . Sad : - ( [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##ruly enjoyed the site for meetings ! Had a wonderful visit at salon [UNK] and at gift shop ! Lu ##nch and dinner ##s were excellent value for the cost . Being on a per die ##m we had options for b ##uff ##et or order from menu ! Service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location for exploring Chicago We had a bedroom as well as living room area The staff at the front desk was amazing - - we had a problem with room and it was corrected immediately by Ba ##sia Ka ##rp . She and Inn ##a were efficient , friendly , and so nice - - we really felt welcomed at this hotel . We also need to mention Maria - - evening housekeeper who went out of her way to show us the " nice ##st " spot on the rooftop to see Michigan Avenue at night . We also utilized the services of Melissa and Marcus , con ##sie ##rge , who were very helpful . Everyone at this hotel went over and above . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I spend 60 - 90 day a year traveling . H ##ya ##tt ' s are worth checking out . The H ##ya ##tt Chicago Regency was clean and the service was top notch . The drinks at the hotel bar were pour generous ##ly and the front desk always met us with a smile . . We look forward to going back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was with a group of friends - hotel was chosen because of the location , which was great . Pi ##llow ##s were comfortable . We loved the window seating and layout of the room . The check in staff and door ##men were wonderful ##ly friendly . The lobby was nice . The only 2 draw ##backs were 1 ) in a double room , only one bed had a nice comfort ##er - the other was basically a sheet . 2 ) we had requested 2 rooms with river views . Although both rooms had the same number , only the higher floor actually could view the river . I would recommend and stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a girls long weekend and this hotel and staff could not do enough to help us enjoy our time . D ##wayne was on spot getting baggage , tables in restaurant , suggestions on places to go and just was a friendly face whenever he saw us . He ’ s a great team member . Room ##s was large and bed ##ding was so comfortable . The hotel is a great location to walk safely around near shopping , Gibson ##s ’ s steak ##house and so much more . We couldn ’ t have asked for a better place for our get ##away weekend . The only negative was the bar and restaurant service is totally lacking compared to the rest of the service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent a week here exploring Chicago . Great location . Very helpful con ##cier ##ge desk and Bell Stand attendant ##s . All our questions ( and more ) were answered . Our river view king room was comfortable and clean . We couldn ’ t fault the hotel . Would certainly return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is nice and clean with spacious room in a very good location . First of all , the front desk person could not tell me how to go to the house of blues which was liter ##ately less than half a mile a way . My girlfriend ' s underwear disappeared from in the bathroom door ( no towels around , so it could not have been taken away by mistake ) . The hotel manager was nice enough to apologize and she gave us cash to replace the item . Later on , I found out I was charged for din ##ning at the hotel ( which I never did ) . I called the hotel bill ##ing department , left a message twice and they never called me back , so I had to dispute the charge with the credit card . Un ##ne ##cess ##ary in ##con ##ven ##ience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had never stayed at the Hilton Chicago . Given its age and size I did not know what to expect . The hotel was really nice . My room was large and completely up to date . Everything was nice . The check in experience was the best I had ever had . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed only one night in connection with a conference on the property , but I will happily look to stay there again the next time I am in Chicago . The room was very nice , the location was convenient and the staff extremely at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed into the Conrad for a two night stay and was very pleased with everything . The lobby is on the top floor , thus the entrance is a little awkward as it doesn ' t feel like you are entering a hotel - as a matter of fact their are a couple ladies near the elevator banks to make sure patrons know where to go . Nevertheless , once in the room I was very impressed as their is plenty of space and the room had all the finest touches . Last ##ly - the work ##out facility was top notch and I really enjoyed working with the battle ropes ( you don ' t find those in any normal hotel gym ! ) . Great stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great view . I had a good price point from hot ##wire and upgraded to a room with a view . I didn ##t like the location , but it was okay with L ##y ##ft and U ##ber . I felt safe . The staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful . I ' d stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After entering the beautiful lobby of this historic hotel I was excited to be spending four nights here . When I entered the elevator I felt that I was in the t ##wi ##light zone . It was small and in poor condition . Exit ##ing the elevator into the lobby the carpet was dirty and din ##gy . The lighting was a ##by ##sma ##l . Our room was off of the main corridor - when we opened the door we encountered all white walls with three small photographs . Two of cows and a tiny one on the main wall that upon close inspection was a saxophone player . The bathroom was equally white . Tiny square awkward sink . After one night in this hospital looking room we checked out and went to the lovely and colorful in ##digo hotel around the corner . Di ##fference was night and day ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ' t beat Palmer House location . Lo ##bby the most civil ##ized interior in the city . Room ##s always neat and clean . Good beds . Fine service . Extra bed was no problem . House ##keeping staff efficient , friendly , and un ##ob ##tr ##usive . There are newer hotels , but none so " right " as P . H . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed in the Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago and I can only say the service was horrible if it is even considered service . We stayed from Thursday to Sunday and our room was cleaned only once , even though we asked them repeatedly if they could clean it or at least make the bed . We would leave the hotel early to visit the city and when we would get back late at night , we always found ourselves with the surprise that they hadn ’ t cleaned the room . I think that given the price and “ status ” of this hotel chain , this would not be a problem . This made our stay here very unpleasant , specially considering that we had to tell them everyday at least twice and they only seemed to listen to us once . A real shame , I won ’ t be coming here again and I wouldn ’ t recommend this hotel to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our party of four all loved our stay at this convenient ##ly located historic hotel . We were all impressed with the clean rooms , comfortable beds , and updated wash ##rooms . Good value and with a very friendly staff full of some great advice . Would stay here again in a minute . Easy walking distance to many great restaurants , attractions and shopping . The John Hancock building is only a block away and across the street is " Rose ##bu ##ds " , one of the best steak restaurants in the city . Not the cheap ##est place , but everyone splits the large 14 oz . mouth ##water ##ing steak ##s . Fe ##lt that the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker exceeded our expectations ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was not impressed by this hotel . Over ##p ##rice ##d and in need of some updates . Be prepared to take 2 elevators as lobby is on 3rd floor . Had a suite , and although it was large , their could have been a better floor plan . The bathroom needs up ##dating and should have 2 sinks in a suite . The rooms are dark and have a s ##tale smell . Unfortunately we were on the 4th floor , the same as the gym and pool . Hotel design should always avoid having those amenities on the same level as rooms . The hotel bar is a nice space with food views but the drinks are expensive and cocktail ##s are und ##rin ##ka ##ble . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed overall . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our recent stay at the Chicago O ##m ##ni was superb . Our room and other facilities met our need perfectly and the hotel and 67 ##6 restaurant staff were among the most court ##eous , kind and professional that we have ever experienced on our domestic or international travels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location of many places to eat and night entertainment . Front desk staff ( Amber ) was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful . I would recommend this hotel to others and will be staying here again in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] confusion with room house ##keeping when asked for more coffee capsule ##s it took two trips to comply correctly , no NY ##T or W ##S ##J as asked for , cups for coffee not replaced after use , same for wine glass . All service very polite but not well implemented Con ##cier ##ge helped but promised follow up information never delivered . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time visit to Chicago was enhanced by the Talbot ##t hotel . From check - in to check - out every aspect of the hotel exceeded our expectations . From Gene the most helpful con ##cier ##ge to the fantastic location this was a f ##abulous place to stay and I wouldn ' t hesitate to stay again or recommend to friends and family [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is old but historic . Beautiful lobby and the hotel employees are at ##ten ##tive . The best part of this hotel is the location . Walking distance to the Park , Art Institute , and shopping . Right next door is a very cool old pub , Miller ##s . Around the back is a great take ##out Max ' s . And across the street is a theatre with the show " Hamilton " . T ##ick ##ets are easy to get online at regular prices and it is worth the trip to skip Broadway and stay at the Palmer to see the show . Executive Lounge leaves a bit to be desired but is adequate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just checked into our hotel tonight to discover that we are here right before a major renovation . The rooms are looking old and the leather chairs , head ##board and bed frames are p ##eel ##ing . The sheets and towels are like sand ##paper . I would expect more from this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco is a beautiful bout ##ique hotel in the Loop with an excellent staff that we found always a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and pleasant during a four day stay in Chicago . Our room on the eleventh floor gave us a view of the river . We found the location central to our walking tours of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am from out of town . If you are from out of town and going to Chicago this is the hotel for you . Joshua runs the happy hour and he did an AM ##A ##Z ##ING J ##O ##B for everyone ! , Great Guy ! Christian and anyone on staff will text you any recommendations you need while you are out . I spoke to the Manager Martin who was also very helpful . Great Hotel , if you need to stay somewhere this is worth checking out . Thanks Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel Peter Si ##bil ##ia [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay here . The historic pool renovation is worth the price of admission . The room was clean and new but small . Very cramped for two adults and two kids . Had a room with two doubles . Just not much floor space . The pool is beautiful but has a minimum depth of 4 feet so bring your pu ##ddle jumper ##s for your little ones ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay in many business hotels but never in a So ##fit ##el before . If ##ou ##nd it to be as good as any top rated hotel like the four season , man ##dar ##ian etc I will certainly consider this hotel chain going forward . It has enough b ##ling w ##o being over the top . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I must say that once again I had a Great Experience at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago from check in with Ms . Ki ##a who was so professional and kind with a few Star ##bu ##cks pro ##mo gift cards . The staff from Vale ##t Jim to Ms . CA ##ND ##Y in the Regency Cafe continue to ex ##em ##p ##lify E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##CE on behalf of the hotel . Thanks to each and everyone for all that you do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good overall stay . Bed was very comfortable and room was co ##zy . Apart from little bit of construction going at the hotel back didn ' t have any issues with the stay . We were also told about the construction while we were checking in and hotel staff clearly mentioned if we faced any issues they would work something out for us . But , it didn ' t bother me much as I was out for work during daytime . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel in a great area . Just a block from water tower place . Close to restaurants and shopping . Very nice staff . Clean room and hotel . About a six dollar L ##y ##ft ride to the train station . Quiet streets . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in was a breeze , the room was clean and spacious with minimal noise . The breakfast served on each floor every morning was a bonus . All of the staff were at ##ten ##tive without being overwhelming . The only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars was r ##ust around the tap in the bathroom . For a recently renovated hotel this should not have been there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has integrated a modern feel into a historic building very well . The Library Bar is one of my favorite places in this hotel . The location is perfect , just on the North side of the city , so it is not so loud as many of the directly downtown hotels ( if you are staying overnight ) . . . and yet , it is just a short walk through beautiful historic homes to Gold Coast area shopping , restaurants , and a bit further and you are into the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le of Ma ##g Mile , etc . Close to the lake , shopping , food . . . it is comfortable , welcoming , and I think an overall great value for ch ##ica ##go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel itself is a little aged , but it is in a great location and the staff is incredible . Have stayed here twice in the past 4 weeks . Would definitely come back again . The lobby and restaurant look to have been renovated recently , the rooms are still a little old with years of paint and base ##boards that have not been replaced in 20 years - but overall , nice place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Home ##wood Suite ##s is convenient ##ly located in the River North area , across from Nord ##strom and the attached shopping complex . The service is excellent , from sales , to front desk , to v ##alet , to house ##keeping , to the attendant ##s at breakfast and happy hour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was very small . None of the amenities were available during our visit . No breakfast was offered , not even continental . To add insult to injury we were charged a $ 100 smoking fee , neither my husband nor I smoke . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room on 23rd floor overlooking river . Very spacious and comfortable . Staff were excellent and assisted in every way from arrival to departure . We used the Club lounge and found that excellent with very friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for a weekend for a personal trip . Overall is okay , but I did not like their executive lounge or the fact that they have limited availability for executive floor rooms . The location is great , and loved the bar in the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The title says it all . The location was perfect . It allowed me to shop and din ##e in areas throughout the Gold Coast and River North neighborhoods . My room was further away from Michigan Avenue , so I enjoyed lots of peace and quiet . The staff was professional and court ##eous . I had left my eye ##glass ##es behind while rushing for my return flight , After a quick phone call , the O ##m ##ni staff was able to find and mail them back to me in Arizona . For that alone , they earned my business ! : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in Fair ##mont Chicago during a business trip and had a great time . The location is very convenient - walking distance to the Millennium Park , Chicago Art Institute , the magnificent mile . G ##ro ##cer ##y shops and restaurants near . The room was spacious and modern . I stayed on a Gold Floor and compliment ##ary breakfast was amazing ! There ’ s a well equipped gym in the hotel that was empty when I visited . The hotel also offers bikes . I would glad ##ly return to Fair ##mont Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location for a girls weekend get away ! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful ( when leaving Sunday am , the door ##man asked us if we grabbed everything , including our charge ##rs , g ##ad ##gets , curling iron , etc . ) . For someone who generally leaves something behind , this reminder was very thoughtful ! ! We also missed the free wine social by an hour . . . so the front desk gave us a credit to the At ##ta ##ched restaurant / bar . The room had two queen ##s and plenty spacious ! ! Two com ##fy window seats made for a great relaxing space while still observing the city below . Will definitely stay again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very convenient to A ##on Center . Room ##s are modern , well kept and comfortable . Con ##cier ##ge lounge on 15th floor had an excellent array of food and beverages throughout the day . Hotel staff was persona ##ble , at ##ten ##tive and helpful for all requests . Thank you Fair ##mont Chicago for an excellent stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved staying at this hotel ! Staff were so helpful right from check - in , very polite and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting even with a pretty long check - in line ( which I think usually happens when conferences are held here ) . The lobby area is stunning and very pretty ! I had a room with a lake view and it was absolutely gorgeous . This is a great location if you plan to walk around the city . Within 20 minutes , you can get to the bean ( Cloud ##gate ) , G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s pizza , other great food and shops . Grant Park is literally across the street , the Field Museum is ~ a 20 minute walk . More pizza and restaurants are within 5 minutes . It ' s great to get to experience so much in a safe area without needing to worry about paying for a car to take you everywhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The best part of this hotel is location . You can walk almost anywhere . The view we had was the on the River Walk , lovely . Very expensive to park your vehicle . Park ##ing in the garage was difficult . . Hard to find which garage went to our hotel . Wish there was more info in the hotel on the hotel and area . Staff was lovely . Room was clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful property with excellent location right across from the C ##IB ##C theatre . Best hotel in the downtown loop area . Excellent executive lounge and business facilities . This hotel has something for everyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in Chicago ’ s theater district . Easy access to Broadway shows , the River walk , Millennium Park , restaurants and public transportation . Do not hesitate to host your next meeting in their conference rooms with natural light . The staff consistently goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need . Do not miss the daily Pro ##se ##cco hour in the beautiful lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You wouldn ’ t think a bell ##man could have a lasting effect on a hotel stay , but this guy was amazing . The hotel is lovely , I could see the lake from my room on the 25th floor . The bathroom was spacious with a nice makeup mirror . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From check - in to check out the staff was awesome . Everyone , you came in contact too always spoke to you and asked how your stay was . Check ##ed in via text and by phone to see if the room was fine . Can ' t wait to stay there again this coming Jan 2020 . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Han ##a De ##yes gave us an excellent service throughout our one week stay . My husband and I found her helpful , always graceful , does her job with a very positive attitude , and always with a smile . She was wonderful ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago Hotel every Thanksgiving when we are in town to visit relatives . I recommend getting a superior corner suite bundled with parking and breakfast for the best deal and quiet ##est room setup . This hotel is near Northwestern Hospital so you can expect to wake to the occasional ambulance in the middle of the night . This is really the best balance of luxury , afford ##ability , and location in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was clean , nice , elevators were modern , fast , and promptly available due to new technology of pre ##sel ##ec ##ting your floor . The front desk personnel were very pleasant , and helpful ! The location has a lot of appeal , food , the river , the lake , and beautiful views . I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Chicago , especially the trade shows , it is very close to McCormick center . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was staying at Hilton Chicago for a week with my family to attend a conference at M ##c Co ##rm ##ick . This hotel is very central and easy to access . The stay was great in this particularly large hotel . Staff was nice and helpful . I must particularly acknowledge Matt from the registration desk and Si ##l ##via , the Director of Reservation ##s , that were both really aware to our requests and made our stay perfect . I fully re ##com ##mand for family and b ##ui ##s ##ness trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location . It is a nice place to relax and un ##wind . The lounge / bar area was nice . The beds were comfortable . The rooms were older , but nice . This is a hidden g ##em . I would highly recommend staying here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This place is decorated so beautifully , the staff is so incredibly wonderful , and compliment ##ary drinks at happy hour ! What ' s not to love ? ? I travel a lot for work and have stayed many places . There is something special about this place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted this hotel for 5 nights from July 25th - 30th . Staff were fantastic , particularly some of the breakfast staff ( Rafe ##lle ##o ) was very kind to us . Room ##s were lovely with very comfortable beds and pillows . W ##i - Fi wasn ' t free in the rooms , which it should have been , but was free in the lobby . The bar in the lobby was fantastic also and we couldn ' t possibly have asked for a better location . High ##ly recommended [SEP]
0	[CLS] The on ground experience at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago is fine . It ' s the booking that is a problem . Not all A ##cco ##r hotels participate in the Re ##ward ##s program . we were unaware of this until after we had booked . So be wary ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t stay here if you want a good work ##out . The gym is small and has little to recommend it . The hotel is nice . They have a nice wine event in the evenings that ' s a good way to relax and maybe meet a few people . Room are fine - - nothing fancy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 2 nights here with our dog . The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful , from Ricky , the door ##man to Gene , the con ##cier ##ge to everyone we met . The hotel is in the center of everything and the room was spacious and comfortably furnished . Will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location and had excellent amenities . The room was comfortable and clean . It came with a kitchen and decent size refrigerator that actually worked . The hotel was near everything we wanted to do ; shopping , theaters , restaurants , bars . I will absolutely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Charles and D ##wayne are the sweet ##est and it was a joy to encounter them daily during my stay ! Rest of the staff were friendly as well , but those two stand out . I enjoyed the size and comfort ##ability of my room - I just didn ’ t like the construction directly outside my window . Generally I woke up just before it started , but boy was it loud ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very nice . The views on the lake and river sides are amazing . Some of the best I ' ve seen anywhere . The main restaurant needs improving . Very b ##land menu . Nothing creative for dinner service . Nothing healthy for breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed 2 rooms at this hotel to celebrate Christmas with our adult daughter , overall fantastic experience . Room ##s are outstanding , providing many detailed items for ones convenience . The view of Chicago is f ##abulous , the breakfast b ##uff ##et was excellent . ( However not much to choose from if your avoiding car ##bs / sugar / dairy , they do serve bacon but it ' s the super thin type ) They do have a pool and it was warm but no w ##hir ##l ##pool . Overall , for the cost , it ' s well worth the stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience from check in to check out . And team members that remember you with a smile . Had to play luggage games the last day with messed up flights and Bell Des ##k was on point for the duration . Can ##t wait to go back , [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is our second visit to So ##fit ##el and it ' s an amazing location and beautiful hotel I would recommend it to anyone whether it ' s a date night , going downtown for a show , or just a weekend away ! The beds are comfortable and the hotel has an amazing view [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for sights ##ee ##ing . Hotel is close to hop on hop off bus stop , public bus , and river architecture tour . It is an easy walk to Millennium Park and Michigan Ave . The lake view was spectacular ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I arrived . . . the people at the front desk could not have been nice ##r . I had asked for an upgrade . . . got it . . . and then they gave me another upgrade . Great room in an amazing location . I will definitely stay there again . It ' s nice to stay at a place where everyone has a smile on their face and is friendly . Thank you all ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister and I had a mostly great experience at the Palmer House . The best part was our room . We had two queen sized beds and two bathroom ##s . All very comfortable . Unfortunately , the Palmer House has put all of its site information on tablets in the rooms . Our tablet had a fault ##y connection and wouldn ' t charge , S ##O we couldn ' t get any of the hotel info . The company the hotel hire ##s for the tablets was closed and couldn ' t deliver a new one until morning . Other than that , we had a good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I found this a quite basic hotel and not up to expectations of the brand . Be aware they charge for late check ##out , even if all you are asking for is an extra 30 min ##s after a 5 night stay ! The cleaner ##s also don ' t respect the P ##ri ##va ##cy signs ( this occurred twice in my 5 night stay ) and not something I ' ve experienced at any other major hotel . The hotel is however in a convenient location and close to the river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very Good Stay , Very Big Room ##s , Clean , however , we had 2 rooms and the TV in our Daughters room did not work . 2nd problem was not really the hotels fault , but impacted our stay . We had a Man and Woman next door that were very loud , and you could hear them well down the hallway , if you get my meaning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay here , very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful . I had a leg injury and the team here went above and beyond to help me with anything needed . Very friendly , always smiling , and great v ##ibes . Kay and B ##re were particularly helpful from guest services for any specific requests I had during my stay . Hotel has a nice lobby , with some open works ##pace , co ##zy feel . Room ##s are com ##fy and well appointed . Great location . Overall would highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Solid hotel with a great location . Contemporary design with upper scale services for a Hilton . Staff was extremely professional and helpful , overall a great place to stay if you want proximity to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was here to celebrate my partners birthday , and N ##est ##or was far and beyond with our expectations . He personal ##ized our services at the spa with a top notch customer attention . He provided more that I was expecting to have for my partner and I was very pleased . The massage ##s were fantastic with Ally , she has angel ##ical hands . I definitely wanted to mention this because when you find people who are genuine you want them to be recognized . And that ##s how i felt when i was at my spa . A genuine customer service . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ing here for Chicago Marathon . They are charging almost 400 us ##d per night and officially marathon hotel but they don ' t provide water bottles . . Its height of g ##reed ##iness . . Even you stay anywhere in the world in a 100 us ##d room at least every one provides 2 / 4 bottles of water . . At the check - in time guy was more interested in selling upgrades rather than brief ##ing about hotel . . I stayed 2 weeks in USA different hotels but this is the most less customer oriented hotel . . They need money in everything even storage bags is charge ##able . . S ##hame on hilt ##on for providing such a third class service . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything was perfect ! The room was lovely and huge ! They didn ’ t have a coffee machine , however they offer compliment ##ary coffee during the morning ( it would be better if coffee could be offer all day long ) . We receive v ##ou ##chers for a compliment ##ary glass of wine in the bar . They had great selection of wine ! Great taste , nothing cheap . I would totally recommend this hotel and can ’ t wait to go back when I visit Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great location and a hotel with a lot of History . Room ##s are spacious , comfortable and clean . A older look but kept up and all the amenities you will need are located in the room . Executive floor for Diamond members with cocktail hour , compliment ##ary coffee , tea and pop and breakfast from 6 ##AM - 10 ##AM on the 23rd floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Drop ##ping my son off for college at MB ##I , welcomed by Ricky out front who was warm and very helpful . Room was large and the hotel is in a great location near Michigan Ave and MB ##I . Restaurant had a great v ##ibe and good food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Business travel for four nights . Initially thought the soft bed would be problematic yet slept sound ##ly for four nights . Zero hallway noise . Zero H ##VA ##C noise . Zero neighbors noise . Virtual ##ly no city noise ( was on 22nd floor ) . Very clean - including room , bathroom , public areas . Friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . I was very impressed and pleased with this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was perfect ( unless the snow outside ) . . . room is great ( and big ) and all the employees are very educated and ready to help . Food was great and all the meeting rooms were good enough for a big group . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great time at Hotel Monaco . I loved the window benches and large shower in the corner suites . The hotel , service , and city were all amazing . De ##fin ##ite ##ly check out Eat ##aly while in town . I look forward to the next Chicago trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , close to mill ##eni ##um park , mi ##chi ##gan avenue , the bean , rental bike rack around the corner , walking distance to AMC movie , Navy Pier and great restaurants like Vol ##are , St ##eak 48 , London House roof ##T ##op , Athletic club , etc . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Intercontinental is typically a very nice hotel . However , I have to rate this location a 3 because of the awful stench that hit us upon entry . It smelled like very rotten meat or a dead body in the lobby . I ’ m not ex ##agger ##ating . When we asked an employee about the smell , he pretended he didn ’ t smell anything . The smell was in the lobby , only , thank God . The rooms were nice . We had a view of Lake Michigan from our room so that was a plus . After complaining about the smell the next day , it was finally gone the following morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to return to this hotel after staying here the year prior . The staff was great and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , the food was good and the pool was clean and warm . We had a corner suite and the views were phenomena ##l . It was clean and well maintained . It ’ s in a great location and will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great time staying at the hotel to say the least . Everyone was very nice and helpful . The location is perfect . We highly recommend hands down . Everything was perfect . Looking forward to returning in the near future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I tend to stay away from bout ##ique hotels ( I think it calls itself a bout ##ique ) - normally they seem cutting edge and cool as far as de ##cor but a little short on amenities / service / size . If you need a pool or spa ( they do offer in room spa ) , then you ' ll probably want to pass . But , as far as service , helpful ##ness , courtesy , friend ##liness , they ' re right up there with the best ( plus the de ##cor is very cool ) . Oh , a shout out to Javier - great door ##man who ' s helpful and makes you feel welcome ! Location : F ##abulous . I was born and raised in Chicago - worked and went to school in the loop - and I was impressed with the location - right off the river with a great view of noted buildings along river north . This is truly a great spot located to so ##oo ##o much - definitely recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##w ##ful room , uncomfortable bed , ragged bench in the room , broken down tub ##s - D ##IS ##G ##US ##TI ##NG place . Will never ever stay here again . The hotel staff especially at lunch with the Conference was rude and o ##b ##no ##xious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our children blessed us with an early Christmas gift to Chicago . Our accommodation ##s were excellent on the 19th floor . A huge room with 2 bathroom ##s and 2 very large walk - in closet ##s . A b ##uff ##et breakfast was included along with compliment ##ary coffee or hot chocolate with our special Hilton mug ##s . We enjoyed a hot chocolate on Thursday evening , the 15th in the exquisite lobby . When we came down for Friday ’ s breakfast - w ##ow what a surprise . Christmas had arrived while we slept ! A special bonus was the tree lighting ceremony on Friday afternoon . The Palmer House is still the “ Grand Lady ” of hotels . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I stayed here this past weekend and we were impressed with the hotel for what we paid . Nice , clean , and friendly staff . The hotel was very close to a number of great bars and restaurants that we enjoyed . I would definitely stay here again . Good value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were perfect , I recommend the river view rooms . Also upgrade to the club room ( they offer free non ##al ##co ##hol ##ic drinks , breakfast , hot snack ##s as well as fruits etc in the afternoon ) . There is a pub behind the hotel ( Irish Pub ) good food . The Door ##man Mike knows all the good places to eat and entertainment . This is an easy walk to The Navy Pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was great , off Michigan Avenue so you don ' t get all the traffic noise . Staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Everything you need is within walking distance . At ##e at Di ##t ##kas a few blocks away . Great food and dessert ##s there . Also ate at Co ##co Paz ##zo an mid priced Italian restaurant . Room ##s are pretty small but completely updated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I liked most everything about this hotel . Beautiful building , lots of elevators , good location . My only problem was paying extra to use the fitness room . I was not aware of this fee , and I don ' t think they should charge extra to use the fitness room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was able to walk to just about all the attractions in the area and the view of the river was great . I went to Millennium Park , Grant Park , Buckingham Fountain , and Navy Pier in one afternoon . The whole experience was great . You can also check out the University of Chicago : G ##lea ##cher Center , NBC Tower , and great shopping off N . Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful personal service . Smile ##s and courtesy from E ##VE ##R ##Y ##ON ##E ! ! ! Came for I ##MT ##S - booked through their Connection ##s service . The only down ##side was the price of breakfast - $ 30 , too much but everything else was wonderful , from the views to the linen ##s . Thanks ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] They are truly the best , I don ' t know from where to start . They made my birthday an un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble experience . From the moment we checked - in they greeted us and they were really nice to us during our whole stay . The staff was really professional and nice . Food was g ##rate and room was cleaned properly . They even assisted us when we needed to extend our stay for a night due to flight delay . Special thanks to Casa ##ndra who helped us in checking - in and to the manager who assisted us in extending our stay . Thank you so much for caring about us and making us feel appreciated and special . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hands down one of the best hotels in the city of Chicago . From the So ##fit ##el scent to the amazing rooms . Even though I was not recognized for my loyalty or given my welcome drink the hotel location and view are worth it . Steps from the best shopping and even better restaurants . I wish the staff enjoyed their job a little more as the hotel itself is great . Will be back again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely gorgeous ! Old world , turn of the century charm . . the bar was popping , had a lot of great conversations . . . felt normal like pre - pan ##de ##mic times . . I will definitely stay at the Palmer house again my next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was small but nice . The bathroom could have been a little cleaner but I ' ll chalk that up to CO ##VI ##D - 19 and social di ##stan ##cing . I had a view of Ki ##nz ##ie Street as well as the Trump Hotel after I requested a high floor with a view . The staff was very friendly and inform ##ative , all except the v ##alet which seem to take at least 30 min ##s and cost $ 73 a night which was almost the price of my room ! That being said , I had a decent stay in downtown Chicago for a fairly low price ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good hotel experience , but be ##ware the additional " Man ##da ##tory Hotel Fe ##e ' , It is not clearly disclosed until after you have completed the booking . The rest of this is fill ##er so I can meet the 200 word minimum . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not cheap , but great views , nice folks , good in and out with the car , and a ton of fun activities , good restaurants and great parks , including Mill ##eni ##um and lake ##front , nearby . Had ##n ' t been there in 20 years . . . I ' ll be back in less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ##m a gold a member and i have never experienced such a bad treat like in this hilt ##on . Dirty , over ##rated and rude working people . Price is ridiculous for what you get . Never back here for sure . Despite i am a gold member i did not get any of the benefits ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Girl ##friend and I stayed for a night recently on an enjoyable evening downtown . Wonderful location . F ##law ##less check - in . Over the top friendly staff throughout . Nice view from our room . The evening reception with two compliment ##ary token ##s was a nice surprise . The continental breakfast was typical but really convenient on each floor . Park ##ing also typical for area but no trouble getting a spot in nearby garage . High ##ly recommend and would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the second time I have stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie . Very nice hotel with great customer service . Some changes from last year . . . . continental breakfast now only on the 6th floor instead of every floor by the elevator . This was actually nice ##r . . . made me eat with others instead of alone in my room . The other is happy hour . . . no more Ki ##nz ##ie coins but plenty of wine and beer . No longer heavy ho ##r d ’ o ##eu ##vres but light snack ##s . Wait staff during happy hour were very friendly ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , amazing staff , comfortable beds , hope to expand our traditional weekend next year to our friends and family for added fun . Re ##com ##men ##d this hotel to everyone . Make this one of your traditions . [SEP]

My son and I were staying for a night on way to Milwaukee while my wife and daughter were supposed to fly home . When flight got cancelled , I needed larger room . The staff was extremely understanding and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and moved us into a larger room . I really te ##rri ##fic experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A funk ##y bout ##ique hotel . Hotel reminiscent of the She ##rato ##n Palace in San Francisco with eclectic de ##cor and very small bathroom ##s . Good location . Extreme ##ly quiet which is rare in the city of Chicago ! Close to the el . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Center of it all , easy walk to downtown , to solid ##er field . Restaurant ##s nearby . C ##ab ##s always available which is great . The river cruise is a must , along with the She ##dd A ##c ##qui ##rum . Pay the $ 57 to upgrade so you can use the 15th floor for breakfast , drinks , sweet ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] hotel is located near Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile two blocks away and great restaurants like g ##ib ##son ' s steak ##house the staff were helpful and friendly the hotel has a small restaurant which is ok and a separate bar which was fun for last call [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this historic landmark hotel is excellent with a number of attractions within walking distance . Room ##s are spacious and the decorations are just as generic as you would expect in a Hilton hotel of this size . Co ##m ##fort ##able but not very exciting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed here before but continue to go back to the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . Room ##s are great and the service is outstanding ! You cannot go wrong with choosing this Hotel . Great location on the North end of the Ma ##g . Mile and easy to get to Water Tower Place , eating spots and bars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love Kim ##pton ##s . They are all very different but have the same standards . I was in town for meetings , all of which were walking distance of the hotel . The front desk staff was very friendly and checked on me via text during my stay . The bed was very comfortable . The room wasn ' t very big and no view , but they let me check in at 10 : 45 am so I can ' t complain at all . I wish they served red wine at happy hour instead of prose ##cco , but I also can ' t complain about free wine . There is a Star ##bu ##cks attached to the hotel and a nice small bar in the lobby . Plus lots of free daily newspapers . I ' ll stay here again on my next work trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great bout ##ique hotel central ##ly located close to the heartbeat of the downtown . The team at the Talbot ##t sets the bar very high for customer service , clean accommodation ##s at a reasonable price . From the moment we arrived at the hotel the check in experience was fast friendly and efficient . The con ##cier ##ge and door staff were all very knowledge ##able and enthusiastic with trying to help us enjoy ma ##xi ##mize our stay in downtown Chicago . Room ##s are a fair price for nice quality and functionality . Great amenities at the hotel for a quick work out or dining out . A ##wes ##ome location right in the heart of the shopping districts . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Park ##ing was not included in the room stay and was an extra $ 65 . The bathroom was small and awkward , especially for two girls trying to get ready . The rooms were dated and the outlets seemed un ##safe . The staff was friendly and the bed was comfortable . There definitely needed to be an additional mirror in the room itself , as the bathroom was just too small . There was also no fridge to store our drinks and other snack ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent - - love the locations and quality of the hotel . Staff is warm and competent . Am ##eni ##ties are thoughtful . Love ##d coffee and juice outside the room in the morning . Quality of towels , linen ##s and beds is great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can ' t say enough about how much I loved this hotel ! We have stayed previously at the Embassy Suite ##s downtown , and the Home ##wood Suite ##s is so much better there is no comparison . The staff is much friend ##lier , and even though this hotel is busy it doesn ' t feel like a zoo . Yes , the breakfast and the evening reception are crowded , but if you go early its quite manage ##able . Our room was spacious , quiet and comfortable . I will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and very helpful / friendly staff who was happy to give directions or advice when needed . The evening reception was relaxing and the morning breakfast was good quality . The location was excellent convenient to the boat tours as well as walking distance to Navy Pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lac ##k ##luster hotel and room . Not well designed for family . Additional pull out bed of bad quality and cheap furnishings . Other than location and breakfast it has nothing else going for it . Vale ##t staff needs training and attitude adjustment . Not helpful ##ly or knowledge ##able about down town . G ##ave wrong directions and advise on multiple occasions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So ##fit ##el is located in a great spot just off the magnificent mile close to many shops and great restaurants ! Room ##s were very clean . Staff were very professional . Restaurant and bar were both top notch . My only complaint is the shower . Very tight to get in and out ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great customer service on every level . Fast friendly & efficient . Clean modern furniture through out hotel . Bo ##ttle ##s of water provided @ no change . My daughter left her makeup remove ##r at home they provide her some quickly . A little on the price ##y side but you get what you pay for . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed in a lot of hotels and have of course had the periodic issue here and there , but my stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand in Chicago had so many issues , it was hard to keep track . An absolute nightmare ! Even after completing the post - stay survey the hotel sent and listing the multitude of issues and problems during my stay , I received a stock response from a front desk supervisor . I value feedback from others on Trip Advisor and hopefully my feedback is helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The stay at the Intercontinental was a nice stay . The pool is B ##EA ##UT ##IF ##U ##L . The hotel is lovely . The service is wonderful . We were able to check in a little early and check out a little late . We had a standard room with two double beds . It was a small room and we had two adults and two children . The room had everything that you could have needed , except any room to stretch out . . . but that being said , we didn ' t spend much time in the room . You cannot beat the location and why would you stay IN when you are in such a great city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Inc ##ons ##ist ##ent . Some things quite good and some things lacking . Great location for shopping , dining , and walking . The Library is a nice space . In in ##ef ##ficient check - out . Bath ##room needed attention . Room was adequate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights for a conference . Hotel busy for Chicago Marathon , so room not ready early but no big deal . My floor , 33 , is in need of an update . Wall ##paper p ##eel ##ing in hallway ##s , and furniture in the room I ' m sure was there when the hotel opened . Room was very nice size , with bath and separate shower . For some reason , I didn ' t really like the bed , can ' t say why , just didn ' t sleep well in it - - probably just me . As to the location , not perfect if you like to shop , it ' s a bit of a hike to get to the main shopping area on Michigan Avenue . Great location if you like Mill ##eni ##um Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Within the last month , I ’ ve stayed at this location on 4 separate occasions , totaling 7 nights . Each stay I ’ ve become more and more impressed with the rooms , restaurants attached and those working . Specifically , I ’ ve come to know Kenny . He has been wonderful to chat with anything from history of the hotel to making my stay as smooth as possible . I will be back plenty more times and look forward to it . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every employee was very ho ##sp ##ita ##ble and made me feel very welcomed comfortable during my stay . Never had any issues that you sometimes have . Would definitely recommend and stay at this place again . S ##pent most nights at the bar instead of clubs and had a wonderful time with friends and the bar staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic hotel and great facilities , an absolute g ##em . The selection for breakfast was excellent . Room service was also very ta ##sty . All staff seem to be happy to work here and always smiling . Thank you for the great hospitality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful lobby in this historic hotel . Our room was small and starting to look quite dated . missing many of the amenities that would be deemed standard in most hotels these days . The best part of this hotel is the location - It was perfect for walking to everything we wanted to do . I would stay again but I also would look at other options in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I upgraded to a higher category of room , with the same square footage but a different layout & was very pleased . It felt spacious well beyond its square footage . The bed was superb - - supportive but not hard . The bathroom was well appointed , with a walk - in shower & a tub ( with a re ##tract ##able clothes line ) . I chose a lake view , but it was partially obscured by the tall buildings along the outer drive . Great location , next to Millennium Park . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So I stayed at this hotel when I go to Chicago for work . I used to stay somewhere else close but decided to try this and I was not disappointed . My room was huge with beautiful views and a super com ##fy bed . Will stay again next time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This co ##zy bout ##ique hotel is located just south of the river near the loop in downtown Chicago , Illinois . Extreme ##ly friendly staff . S ##na ##gged a great rate for $ 125 a night in a Mediterranean Suite . The high floors offer nice views of downtown Chicago . Wine reception between 5 and 6 in the afternoon . Very friendly atmosphere . Very dog friendly . Within easy walking distance of the blue line to O ' Hare Airport . Even closer to the other train lines in the loop . Easy check in and check out . Great desk for working with no ##less than 4 plug ins for devices . Couldn ' t have asked for a better experience from the very beginning to the very end of our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
0	[CLS] Chicago has its fill of hotel choices . I appreciate a smaller bout ##ique type property , but when you add the level of service at The Talbot ##t Hotel , you have a winning combination that I think would be hard to beat . Every now and again you get treated so well that you find yourself developing what I de ##em a [SEP]
0	[CLS] We sincere ##ly enjoyed our stay at the Fair ##mont Chicago . The gold lounge staff went above and beyond expectations . They were very personal and made our stay extra special ! They were great at helping us secure transportation around the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel very clean , beds nice . Staff nice . Pick ##ed this hotel for room service but an hour and a half wait is too long . No pool , fitness center closed . Note : not hotels fault but cab ##s and U ##ber ’ s to solid ##er field $ 10 Return ##s were $ 50 gotta love city View ##s amazing night and day . Quick walk to Mill ##eni ##um park [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really appreciate the outstanding hospitality provided during our stay . Special thanks to Ni ##ek for arranging such a nice room for us including the warm welcome . We ' ve experienced a professional service from the very first moment we ' ve arrived at the hotel until the check - out . Kay ##lin and all the staff members were very kind to answer all our questions and they made our stay very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was large and comfortable with great beds . I mentioned that it was my 50th birthday and was sent a bottle of champagne and dessert to our room . The breakfast b ##uff ##et was delicious and the service was outstanding . The Manager , Shawn was incredibly helpful . The location was ideal . This is an outstanding hotel ! I highly recommend it and I will stay here when I return to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a night to catch a show at the theater next door . Co ##zy and fun rooms had a great 1920s v ##ibe going on with ultra com ##fy beds and the old wooden window frames on the other side of the modern glass . Had great staff , fast check ##in / out , can ’ t wait to go back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We “ stay ##cation ” here a lot and I feel like it ’ s not as nice as it used to be . The room we got was small and dark , and for the price we were paying I was very disappointed . I replied to the front desk text that asked me if we were satisfied with our room , telling them that I wasn ’ t , and I didn ’ t hear back until we were at dinner . At which point we were tired and didn ’ t want to switch rooms that late for a one night stay . The pool is still really nice , but for the price you can get better rooms in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great hotel and excellent location . We stayed here for 3 nights or a long weekend mini vacation . The beds were very comfortable and it had the best hair ##dr ##yer I ' ve ever had in a hotel room . I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is nice , but it is two block from a major hospital so you hear ambulance ##s a lot . You do get used to it after a day or so . Room ##s are clean and re ##mo ##del ##ed , but small . The tub is pretty small too . Nice products though . The best service at this hotel is the bell ##man and luggage attendant ##s at the entrance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in the middle of The Loop . Cool decoration and amenities including fresh coffee in the mornings and wine in the nights ( Free of charge ) . Walking distance to the theaters and to the Millennium Park and Willis Tower . Dogs are allowed and that is very cool . Having a drink in the lobby with a some cool dogs around . The room was very quiet . : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked two nights here to start our holiday off and were very pleased with all aspects . Guys on the v ##alet service were very helpful and inform ##ative . Location was good for walking around the city . Love ##ly surprise that a dinner social was offered on Mon - T ##hur ##s evenings ( free ! ) and the food was great ! Swimming pool nice too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was very spacious with plus ##h bed ##ding . I enjoyed great rest each night . The hotel is close to Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue . Star ##bu ##cks and gift shop were great additions . The staff is very a ##cco ##mo ##dating , helpful and court ##eous . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d my stay ( 4 nights in June , 2018 ) for a girls ’ get - away . Travis Howard was amazing — he found us the best restaurants and made our visit so easy . The location is perfect — within walking distance of all the sites , yet set apart from the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le in a quiet Gold Coast neighborhood . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel went through a major restoration to bring it into the 20th century but you can still feel the g ##lamour and beauty of the 150 year old hotel Staff is very nice , as if writing this the hotel still is Co ##vid " closed " i ##e some part are not open and staff and hour a re limited for dining no room service b u ##t a very clean hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Visiting our daughter that lives literally 2 blocks away from this hotel ! Room was nice and modern , the staff outside were friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , but once inside , it felt cold with no personality . Front desk at check in : No smile , no welcome , nothing . I asked about area restaurants to grab a quick bite since we drove about 7 hours and having never visited there , and got the standard " there ' s places all around the hotel " . OK then . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the staff - very at ##ten ##tive in all parts of the Hotel . I was not sure that I was still in the H ##ya ##tt ( I was ) and H ##ya ##tt staff noticed me and sought to assist me . I do not usually enjoy taking meals in the hotel . However , in this hotel I wanted to have every meal because of the service . The food as well . I was extremely impressed with the in - house cable . There is a channel to teach you how to work - out in your room . My only issue was with na ##vi ##gating the location of self - parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel had great views , soft beds , clean rooms , and the location was perfect for touring ! The parking was interesting because it ’ s a tight squeeze once you go down into the garage plus there ’ s not a lot of signs to show you where to go ( exit signs or elevator signs ) . I recommend un ##loading your luggage before parking in the garage ! It was a bit price ##y but understand ##able with it being Memorial Day weekend . Overall it was great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at the Ambassador several times and have always enjoyed my stay . In particular , the staff is friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , efficient and professional . Brenda and Jared at the front desk were great at assisting me with a couple of issues . Travis and a gentleman from security were particularly helpful in helping me retrieve a valuable keeps ##ake that I had absent - minded ##ly left in my room . The rooms are comfortable and clean and I love the quiet neighborhood location just two blocks from the lake ##front . One minor issue is with the noise level in some of the rooms . In some rooms , noise from adjacent rooms travels quite easily , but in others it has been completely quiet . Overall , I enjoy this hotel and wouldn ' t hesitate to stay there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a stunning hotel ! Three immediate ad ##jective ##s : clean , class ##y , and charming . It ’ s also co ##zy and memorable . Clean is perhaps a strange way to start a review , especially about such a stunning and historically relevant hotel , but in today ’ s day and age , it ’ s rare to say anything is spot ##less , let alone a hotel — but this one is . Room was comfortably appointed , and the bed was so very comfortable , I kept hitting s ##no ##oz ##e . The common areas are absolutely beautiful , and the energy in the hotel is vibrant ##ly charged . There are numerous restaurants nearby — check out the Corner Baker ##y for breakfast — and the Star ##bu ##cks on the hotel lower level was an added bonus . Check - in and check - out was efficient . The next time I am in Chicago , I want to stay here ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were there for my birthday and the hotel was beautiful , it was more than I expected . Great place to stay and the employees were very friendly always . My husband wants to go back to Chicago soon ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is great and feels like a modern Fair ##mont , so all good there . Front desk was pleasant and quick . I didn ' t get to see anything other than the rooms , so I can ' t comment on the amenities . When you get off the elevator , you feel like you are in an old hotel that time is catching up with . Then when you walk in the room ( at least mine ) it felt like they were half way through the upgrade . The shower was very modern . But the closet area was not . The t ##v was new , but the wall and trim looked like it was 30 years old . So all in all , it was fine , but not outstanding . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Hilton Chicago for a conference in November 2018 . It was a nice location and the room was comfortable . The only draw ##back was the $ 15 a day cost to use the fitness center . Never encountered that before . Dec ##ided not to use the gym because of the cost . We did have an issue with the heating in the room but the engineer was quick to come and get it fixed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve always loved this grand old hotel . My husband joined me for a one night stay for a business trip and we had a blast . Inc ##red ##ibly magnificent old lobby , great drinks , and a marble fireplace in our imp ##ec ##ca ##ble old works room . Great service , convenient to everything . No other place to stay in Chicago for me [SEP]
1	[CLS] We L ##O ##VE ##D staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie . The Staff was Except ##ional and made the experience so wonderful . We brought our two large dogs . They loved all the attention , the dog beds and houses , the treats , and the toys . They are still wearing their Ki ##nz ##ie banana ##s a week later . We used the v ##alet for our car and had to trouble the staff with putting away and bringing out our car multiple times so we could drive it to our locations . The Staff always had a smile and never complained . I have been recommend ##ing the Ki ##nz ##ie to everyone I meet , telling them to stay there regardless of if they have dogs or not . We will 100 % be back to stay next time we visit Chicago . T ##HA ##N ##K YOU . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location everything was walking distance ! The price was affordable , the room was clean , and the size of the room was huge ! It would have been nice to have a pool / hot tub and breakfast included but overall we will use Fair ##mont with future vacation ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great visit to Chicago and stay with the Ambassador Chicago on this long memorial day weekend . Safe Quiet neighborhood a block from the Lake Michigan . Great Location & Room ##s . Wish their Bar & Restaurant ##s who ##uld have been open . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience . Co ##m ##fy beds . Perfect location - walk ##able distance to everything but far enough from the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le to really enjoy a peaceful sleep at the end of the night . The staff is excellent . Will be back for certain ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful property , tucked away off of the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le of Michigan Ave . Con ##ven ##ient to shopping and restaurants and all of the great sights of Chicago . Would stay here again and again ! Staff was at ##ten ##tive and enthusiastic , view from lobby wonderful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for a few days over the Holiday ##s . It is the perfect spot and in the center of everything - shopping , restaurants , and much more . I have stayed at many Chicago hotels and I will only stay here from now on ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie . From check in every staff member was friendly and court ##eous and we felt welcomed and taken care of . The room was spacious , bed so comfortable and couch was great . It was wonderful to have breakfast included and so convenient to have it located on every floor . We enjoyed our drinks and snack ##s each night in the bar upstairs . Little things like hot chocolate and tea in the lobby made our stay so enjoyable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was beautiful . My room was on the smaller size , but plenty for one to two people . The beds were very comfortable . The hotel is walking distance of many Chicago tourist attractions . The hotel food was delicious as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was awesome ! The hotel staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was excellent ! House ##keeping was the best I ’ ve ever had . They even sent cookies up to our room one night as a bed ##time snack for our daughter ! Excellent views , great location , super com ##f bed and about as much space as you can ask for . . . would stay here again in a heartbeat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you want to visit Chicago and want to be in downtown with minimum cost and maximum am ##eni ##ty pick this hotel . . . located in the heart of downtown Chicago . . full suit with complete kitchen . . . and best breakfast for free . . . Remember , parking in downtown Chicago is very expensive . . . the best way to save money on parking is using Spot ##H ##ero . . . if you have never tried it , just type Spot ##H ##ero in your cell phone , download the app . . . pick your location and get your discount ##ed ticket . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have stayed here for the last several years . The location is fantastic and the look and feel of this iconic Chicago hotel doesn ’ t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . The disappointment came with lack of amenities and service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the front desk repeatedly trying to charge me for services that were included in the price of the room to the poor maintenance of the room itself . Very uncomfortable . It ##ems were left in the room from previous o ##cc ##up ##ant . Heat was not working properly , Must of been 100 degrees in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They market this as an ups ##cale hotel . Do not be fool ##ed , it is not ! This is about as nice as the airport Days Inn . The bed is a queen with a full sheet that clearly is too small . No fitted sheet . The top sheet is filthy with oil / g ##rease on it . The q ##uilt / comfort ##er is old and din ##gy . The TV is satellite . . . it is rain ##ing so no signal and no TV . . . it rains a lot on the Lake . Overall , a really cheap hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very ups ##cale bout ##ique hotel ! Nice employees who were very helpful ! Large rooms with Jonathan Adler soap and s ##ham ##po ##o . Hotel channels a Jonathan Adler feel with cool lighting and Art Dec ##o de ##cor . Clean and reasonably priced as well . Overall a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the best spot to stay in downtown Chicago ! All around excellent service ! The property is clean and well taken care of . The suites seem recently updated and are very comfortable . The fitness center is located on the 19th floor which is a change from most hotels and had great views ! I will stay here again on my next trip to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was skeptical after reading the 1 and 2 star reviews . The elevators are a little bit slow . However our visit was awesome , we are Hilton Honors members and the staff and the property were great . They take their time to make sure your enjoying your visit and its close to all the city sites . I look forward to going there again ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the spacious , clean room . However , I have reservations regarding management ' s financial practices . I booked and pre ##pa ##id our room during March with Book ##ing . com . Yet about two months after we reserved and paid for our room we were informed by Book ##ing . com that the room rate has been increased . We had no choice or say in the matter - the extra money was taken from our credit card . The whole idea of pre ##pa ##ying months before our arrival date was to ensure the best rate possible . I feel that I have been ripped off - even if the increase was only a few dollars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel and service . We absolutely loved the O ##m ##ni located on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . They were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful in anyway needed . If you are traveling to Chicago , seeking a great hotel and want to be in the midst of the happening ##s of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . . . . O ##m ##ni Chicago is the way to go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed on a leisure trip to Chicago to see a friend of ours that is currently in the production of The Nice ##ties . Morgan , the Con ##cier ##ge at the So ##fit ##el , helped us so much and always had a smile on her face . From simple directions , to a sensation ##al recommendation of the Purple Pig , we felt very well taken care of and will definitely stay at the So ##fit ##el and call on her expertise again in the future ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are family of four . We were visiting Chicago during late Jun and find the city extremely beautiful . The experience in Hotel was a great , especially the warm hospitality of the Hotel employees and the hotel location , which is the working distance for most of the interesting point in the downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Set in a stunning location near Lake Michigan and close to the Golden Mile the Hilton Chicago couldn ’ t have been placed better . A grand entrance with a convenience store , a coffee shop and an Irish bar attached . Upon arriving and checking in we were told W ##i ##F ##i was an extra cost , to be honest I would have expected this to be included . The room we had was of a good size but sadly overlooking the rear , the air conditioning unit was extremely noisy leading a very noisy nights sleep . For such a grand hotel and the price tag I would have expected better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 3 nights in this beautiful hotel with views down Michigan Ave and Chicago iconic buildings . Really enjoyed the de ##cor in the hotel along with the f ##abulous swimming pool on the 12th floor . Very central area convenient to all major attractions and don ' t miss the local jazz venue in the evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An “ old charm ” hotel , but charm has left the building . Instead came ne ##gli ##gence and down ##right de ##pressing am ##bie ##nce . “ Hip & historic king room ” was below minimal size . There was no room to place an open suitcase . Historic was the coffee stain from 1986 on the lamp and hip was the p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper . No coffee machine , no glass in the tiny bathroom , no little fridge . Location on State St . is good but there are many beg ##gar ##s constantly ha ##rass ##ing in all hotel entrances . The place feels like a railway station , with massive traffic of people . Some were really loud : twice I was woken after midnight by people shouting at the corridor . The only ray of light is the amazing fitness facility : really huge and very well equipped . Come to see the impressive lobby but stay somewhere else [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed the location , and amenities offered by the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago . The Michael Jordan steak ##house downstairs is first rate , and the pool was very nice . My room had a un ##believable view end it looked just like a post ##card of the miracle mile ! Finally , the con ##cier ##ge in front desk staff were exceeding ##ly helpful in up ##grading my room , and helping me find the fastest way back to the airport . I hope to visit next time with the wife ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Service , Clean ##liness of the bed ##ding was not as exceptional ; comfort ##er had a few stain markings . When house ##keeping was notified a new comfort ##er was brought up to replace immediately . Value and location was worth it . Make sure to include v ##alet parking and breakfast with your stay , if possible you ' ll save money . Sleep quality and overall experience was excellent ! Will definitely come back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room was clean with a beautiful view . The accommodation ##s for every event was excellent and ran efficiently . The staff was friendly and always willing to assist . The overall service was awesome ! Thank you so much for your excellent hospitality ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] D ##wayne was amazing to us and welcomed us with open arms . It was all around a great experience ! It she ##ek with great food and great tailored - to - you service . I highly recommend a stay . It is close to the river and two blocks from Michigan Avenue , which is the shopping center of Chicago . There you can also access the Water Tower Place . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our stay at The Talbot ##t was incredible . The staff are extremely helpful and friendly . They make your stay worth your while . Love ##d it ! ! Will definitely stay here again when we visit Chicago in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Kim ##pton - All ##egro for two nights while in town for a conference . Love ##d it ! From the pro ##mpt v ##alet ##s , bell hop ##s , guest services and house keeping - everyone was excellent . We arrived during “ happy hour ” in the lobby , it felt so welcoming . Check - in was a breeze . My room on the 18 floor was nicely decorated . Bath ##room smaller , but sufficient . The yoga mat and umbrella in the closet were a great touch . I will book this hotel again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here in June for two nights . Hotel has an old school , classic feel to it . The staff were at ##ten ##tive and helping from the minute I stepped on the property . The rooms were clean , upgraded and offered a view worth keeping the curtains open for . The bar was welcoming and offered a smart atmosphere with a few unique cocktail options . End ##ed up eating at the hotel restaurant before taking a tour to the tourist trap deep dish pizza joints . The hotel served us family style with each dish more delicious than the last . I would prior ##iti ##ze staying here if I re ##vis ##it Chi - town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at the wonderful Talbot ##t Hotel and though it is not the same missing Perry and all the employees who always went above and beyond for us , the minimum staff there were very a ##cco ##mo ##dating , friendly and whatever we needed was available in a short time . ( Even a microwave delivered to the room ! ) The location also can not be beat as it is close to wonderful restaurants and shopping in the Gold Coast . I much prefer this location to the busy streets south by the river . They did a great job maintaining distance and followed all co ##vid pre ##ca ##ution ##s . Thank you and we can not wait to return and see you AL ##L again soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a Kim ##pton Ka ##rma member , I was able to get a great last minute deal which included parking . . . which is always a plus in a big city . We enjoy Kim ##pton hotels for the free internet ; happy hour ; morning coffee and $ 10 for mini bar . Hotel All ##egro though , not fond of the de ##cor . . . black walls just don ' t do it for me . The room was very small and the bathroom . . . minus ##cule ! ! But the bed was comfortable and the location was good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A perfect place to call home when visiting Chicago . Spa ##cious , well - designed rooms , incredible location , clean and overall beautiful place . Book ##ed our August stay in January and got 25 % off . Pa ##id less for this hotel than we have for others elsewhere that are not nearly as nice . Wouldn ' t think twice about staying here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean hotel and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble staff . Good size room , though beds were smaller then average queen . Over all continental breakfast was good and whole ##some . En ##joy ##ed our time . Location wise , we could not ask for a better place with the rate we paid . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great property , taste ##ful de ##cor , wonderful amenities . Erica , Gwen and Grace did an outstanding job with a g ##lit ##ch in our reservation , thank you for your kind and helpful response . All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful . This pet - friendly hotel made it possible for us both to enjoy many activities we might not otherwise have been able to experience . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We checked in and were surprised at the small room , so made arrangements to pay for a suite upgrade . The ' suite ' turned out to be two connecting rooms , but the doors in between were locked , and our keys wouldn ' t open second door . I walked down to the front desk three times to get new keys , and they never offered to send someone up . Finally a person came up and mumbled something about a broken r ##fi ##d reader on the door . It is 10 : 30 at night , we never obtained access to our " suite " , and this is my last stay at a She ##rato ##n . Also , they keep calling the second room we can ' t get in to ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a night here on our anniversary . It was great . The staff , the room , the location , the amenities and the restaurants were te ##rri ##fic ! We had dinner in the cocktail lounge - delight ##ful ! And , break ##ast the next morning in the restaurant . Yu ##mmy and relaxing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I thoroughly enjoyed my stay . The hotel itself is in a great location . It ’ s clean and modern . The room was large and very comfortable . The bathroom was also a good size with lots of counter space . The staff is very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Warm friendly staff . D ##wayne provides exceptional service . Room ##s are bright and spacious . The location is ideal for shopping . High ##ly recommend ! The bar was nice with a good happy hour . Walls between rooms are a little thin . We could hear our neighbor ' s t ##v at night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . Con ##ven ##ient location in downtown Chicago and combines old history and charm with modern amenities . Staff are very knowledge ##able and make sure the stay is without problems . High ##ly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] a nice hotel in a good location . Could almost see the lake from the window . Front desk staff were very friendly . Nice shower , but it wet the floor . Room was very nice , but lobby was very under ##w ##hel ##ming . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love to stay in unique and interesting hotels , and while the lobby was spectacular , the rooms left much to be desired . For one night it was fine , but I would have had to move rooms had it been a longer stay . Having a window that was 5 feet from another exterior wall , made it feel like I was in a cave , and the bathroom was the smallest I have ever been in . I have been to Europe many times , and nothing compared to this bathroom . The overall room size was fine , but there was nothing memorable about the room other than the awful bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely hotel . A bit q ##ui ##rky , but I like that . The rooms are very nice . The beds are huge and the window seats are so cool . The gentleman who checked us in was awesome and all the staff were pro ##mpt and helpful . The location couldn ' t be better . Its right on the river and makes access both north and south easy . The only draw ##back is the noise . We were facing the intersection so you could hear traffic , sire ##ns , and the train . I wouldn ' t say it was enough to keep me awake all night , but if you are a light or problem sleep ##er it might . I just considered it the trade off you get for having a great view right in the middle of everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Public Hotel July 2016 after many years of wanting to experience it . I generally visit Chicago once per year and always make it a point of eating at The P ##ump Room ( wonderful by the way ) . And promised myself on one visit I would experience the hotel . It was run down , dirty - like the light fixtures had a layer of dust on them that had been a ##cc ##um ##ulating . The carpet ##s were torn , filthy and need desperate replacing . The bed linen ##s were nice but they were placed in a room with din ##gy walls , out ##dated bathroom ##s and layers of dust so thick I need Z ##ry ##tec . The lobby is beautiful , the restaurant is wonderful but the rooms were so awful . Hu ##ge Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ment . . . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The common areas are very nice and offer all different types of atmosphere ##s . The food was very good and not over priced . The room was typical , clean and comfortable . I will stay at this location again for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , staff and family friendly . The v ##alet parking team is very court ##eous . It is a busy street , but they get you in and out doing your stay with grace and ease . The rooms are very clean and relaxing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was introduced to Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel through a colleague . After spending a night there , I will book it from here on out . Great location and great facility . Everything was exactly what I like . Very clean , great breakfast , nicely decorated and friendly staff . I will stay their for business and pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family of four stayed at this property for two nights , for a quick trip to visit friends in Chicago . In ##ex ##p ##lica ##bly , after the first night of staying on the Executive ( 19th ) floor , no one ever cleaned our room . When I called to complain and ask for new towels and soap / s ##ham ##po ##o , a worker came by and told us that the room was never cleaned because our " Do Not Di ##st ##ur ##b " sign had been on the door all day , which I know what not true . Then , a second worker knocked on our door and told us not to complain to management about the fact that the room had never been cleaned that day . No one else offered to help or re ##ct ##ify the situation ! 100 , 000 H ##H ##ono ##rs points down the drain , just to watch my kids trip over dirty bath towels in the bathroom ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great find in central Chicago ! This hotel has updated modern de ##cor and large rooms . The rooms also have a small sofa . Large bathroom ##s . Bed ##s and pillows are comfortable . A couple of aspects are really unique . The hotel hosts a happy hour at night , with a selection of snack ##s . In the morning , they put out a breakfast selection in the elevator lobby on each floor . The selection included hard boiled eggs , cereal , yo ##gu ##rt , bag ##els , don ##uts , m ##uff ##ins , coffee and tea . Because the little b ##uff ##et is in the elevator lobby , the rooms nearest the lobby are louder , so avoid if you are a light sleep ##er . I was here for a business meeting , and certainly hope that we will return soon ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was staying at So ##fit ##el Chicago for three nights and i had two separate reservation .

Thank you So ##fit ##el for such a employee and great customer service . I will be back again soon . Did ##ier C [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently visited to Chicago for family vacation . I booked family room in advance . But for our surprise room was sold . I was shocked ! I have kids and we needed at least 3 beds . Fr ##ond desk offered us $ 100 hotel discount and one room with 2 double beds , but I was not interested and asked manager . Manager ##s name Julia Ma ##st ##ian ##je ##lli came out , she was very nice with us and solved our problem by offering 1 extra room . I was pleased from Hotel staff and their service .

1	[CLS] Hotel is in a great location . Close to Ma ##g Mile , restaurants and bars . Quick walk or u we ride to places in river north . Staff was friendly . Check ##in and check ##out was quick . Room was perfect . Not small at all . Good bar in the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great time at the Ki ##nz ##ie ! Great Staff great drinks ! The bar on the 6th floor is a must see . We got our first drink for free ! Melissa and Drake at the front are the Best ! They really made my experience special ! It ' s central ##ly located so you can really experience all of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location - with C ##ab service very easy . Close to Michigan Avenue for shopping . The service at the hotel is excellent ! We were disappointed the the bar was closed for re ##mo ##del ##ing as it was a favorite location to have a night ##cap . They are also re ##mo ##del ##ing the gym / work ##out room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro was perfectly situated for my downtown Chicago meetings . The staff was friendly and accessible at all times and helped with all of my questions . The rooms are fully updated with new bathroom ##s , plenty of outlets ( four on each side of the bed ) and all of the in - room amenities you ' d expect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was the basic king , spot ##less , bright , very comfortable bed , good linen ##s , nice forest shower ( rain no ##zzle and it was quiet & well serviced . The hotel is around the corner from the Hancock Tower , near Bloom ##ing ##dale ##s and Water Tower mall ##s , within walking distance to Holy Name Cat ##hed ##ra & lots of restaurants . We plan on staying there again in the near future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay here . The location is right on the river and is walking distance to nearly everywhere . Ka ##ni ##fu ##s ( or close to that ) was so pleasant and looked for the best room available for early check in . I appreciated it greatly ! We loved our room E ##X ##CE ##P ##T the air condition ##er barely worked . It made sound but took about 8 hours to cool the room which is un ##rea ##son ##able . The bathroom was small ##ish but well appointed . I would happily stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel was so amazing to work with for our wedding . We are from Kansas City and got married in Chicago so most of the planning was done remotely . The staff at the Talbot ##t made it so easy for us . We kept in touch leading up to the wedding day and they accepted deliver ##ies for us , assisted with picking out the menu , setting up rooms , printing menu ##s etc . It was truly above and beyond what was expected . The entire staff also knew who was there for the wedding and was so friendly . The Talbot ##t made this day so special for us , our family , and our friends . We would highly recommend it to everyone whether it is for a wedding or just staying for the weekend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Un ##believable service from the moment you get there to the moment you leave , specifically from Antonio , truly a g ##em who makes your stay welcoming . Hotel and rooms were beautiful and clean . Stay ##ed in a suite and loved the seated windows to view the city . The room and view made me not want to leave for the event I came for just to stay in . Will be staying again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] AAA ##AA + They worked hard to meet my exact ##ing diet ##ary needs , accommodation ##s were nothing less than perfect and the staff bent over backwards in all respects . . . . with a smile ! The Fair ##mont is now my first choice for all future Chicago stays . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with another couple for a fun night on July 4th ! The staff is super helpful and professional . The " happy hour " was a bonus - nice snack ##s and a free drink did not hurt our festivities ! But the continental b ##uff ##et was the ultimate in convenience . walk out your door a few feet and fill tray with breakfast good ##ies ! Great concept . The hotel is super clean and unique with cool artwork . Location is ideal for walking to all the key sites ! Can ' t wait to visit again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The check in was not good . not enough staff for a bi ##f conference checking in using persons who were not experience and in training . I was placed in a room on the complete op ##os ##ite side form my access to the H ##ya ##tt am ##ini ##ties . I was then given a room overlooking the roof . I requested a room with a view . I had to come down and wait in line to get another room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby looked smart but my room was must ##y , had a small window , badly needed up ##dating and the bathroom was minute . The room was noisy too and I could hear banging all night even though I was on the 17th floor . I asked to be moved but nothing happened . I would not recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was friendly . The room was great and the location was close to everything I needed . My check ##in was sea ##m ##less and the banquet staff took care of my diet ##ary r ##t ##fs . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker has the el ##egan ##ce of an old hotel with modern and updated rooms . The rooms can be very small however . A door ##man and bell hop greet you upon arrival . It has a nice lobby with a bar and a pianist in the evening . It is located at the northern end of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , beside the Hancock Tower and across the street from the classic Drake Hotel . The lake is at the end of the block . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great west side location . . . wonderful ##ly decorated suites with very comfortable beds . Great work ##out facilities and pool . Very nice lobby with comfortable seating , a co ##zy fireplace , and family games available . The hot breakfast was outstanding ! We plan to re ##vis ##it when in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We ’ ve stayed at the Swiss many times . This Hotel is my favorite hotel in Chicago but this time it took the cake . Not only has it been updated and renovated but the staff this time just really went over and beyond to ensure that our stay was excellent especially Nicole “ Nikki ” at the front desk . She was so at ##ten ##tive on making sure We had the perfect room and that we were comfortable . The manager at the time was also very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Now this is a completely new staff that we encountered from previous times and I hope they stay and are always there when we ’ re in town . All in all the Swiss ##ote ##l is a 10 star hotel thanks to them . We will definitely be back time and time again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved everything about The Talbot ##t . I would highly recommend for a work or play visit to Chicago . Location is premier , de ##cor ##ating trend ##y and co ##zy , staff fantastic , restaurant and bar inviting . Say hello to D ##wayne the bell ##man - a g ##em . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , excellent clean ##liness with an e ##co - friendly staff that clean ##s up the way you want it done . Strange layout of bathroom has a tub AND a shower ( in rooms with a king ) , not that there ' s anything wrong with that . Tri ##ang ##ular shape of the hotel makes the lobby oddly organized . H ##OW ##E ##VE ##R , direct access to the " P ##ed ##way " allows you to walk to neighboring hotels even in the cold Chicago weather . There is an underground " shopping mall " where coffee and don ##ut shops are placed where you can get a quick breakfast , if you don ' t want to pay hotel rates . Breakfast not included in the room ( in my deal anyway ) . G ##RE ##AT location relative to Michigan avenue , and not bad to Navy Pier either . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We used to stay on Michigan Ave . But since we found this little treasure a few years ago , this is our newest choice . The neighborhood is great . There are many restaurants within walking distance . They have v ##alle ##t parking and there are self parking ramp ##s a block away too . The staff is always friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They have a little champagne social around 6 pm . This time we went to a concert at United Center . Not too far of a taxi ride . The rooms are on the small side . The beds are really comfortable . I really like the modern de ##cor . This place reminds me of a European bout ##ique . All the comfort ##s of home ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for one night for a business meeting a few blocks away , so location was convenient . Hotel is well maintained and service was good . Price was reasonable at $ 200 per night compared to others in the area . Room had modern de ##cor , was clean , and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a conference there last week and stayed for 4 days . The hotel is very nice and in a great location . It is a block from Michigan a ##ve and within walking distance of shops , restaurants , theater , etc . Our room was clean and service was good . I would stay there again in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Me and my cow ##or ##kers spent a good amount of time in the Gold Lounge ! We always had ace service , especially from Man ##dan ##a ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly worth up ##grading just to experience what they had to offer ! Ch ##eers ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel and restaurant staff were great . The location was within walking distance of many great attractions . The room was large and bed was comfortable . I will most definitely stay there next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel is fantastic . Right in the middle of everything . Lo ##bby area is nice and hotel food is better than I expected . Room ##s are very average . The stock ##ed fridge and $ 8 bottle ##d waters are a joke . Was a little p ##ee ##ved they wouldn ’ t extend an extra hour for check ##out when the overwhelming majority in our party did receive an extra hour . All in we spent 2 ##k just for my family and you can ’ t give me an extra hour ? Give me a break . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel itself is nice . Great view , awesome location . Food choices at the hotel are limited and expensive for what you get . I would suggest walking a couple of blocks and explore the many great other choices . House keeping during the week , are so nice , friendly , pro ##mpt , and have great attitudes . Weekend house keeping is SL ##OW , lazy , and piss ##y attitudes . They sit around and talk for hours before ever trying to work . The leave their cart at the end of the halls and then go disappear for most of the morning . Too ##k hours for my room to be cleaned , even after calling and complaining . Too bad for them , because I always tip house keeping , but not this weekend crew . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d this hotel . Our room was very large and comfortable . To ##ns of things to do within walking distance , lots of great places to eat and drink as well . There are only 3 elevators from the hotel lobby so there was a short wait during busy hours but that was certainly no big deal . Nice gym and pool area . Would recommend and would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kay and the rest of the staff were friendly and extremely helpful from the moment we checked in through departure . The location is great , walking distance to the best the city has to offer . Will definitely return on a future visit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice stay in the heart of downtown Chicago , very convenient location and nice room view . Will choose O ##m ##ni again in the future . The v ##alet parking is a little bit expensive , 70 dollars per night , but the service is nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first stay at a Conrad Hotel and I would definitely stay there again . Very up to date , contemporary hotel with luxurious amenities and elegant rooms . And the staff and service were top notch ! Great job all around ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is by the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile near shops . The bed extremely comfortable . Very clean . The view was amazing . El ##eva ##tors short walks to amenities . I recommend . Everything couldn ' t have been perfect [SEP]
1	[CLS] I liked the hotel . Location was great . People were nice . Room was nice . They had compliment ##ary coffee , ice water and ice tea . . . very nice . However , I was really annoyed that I went to use the computer to print my boarding pass , I was charged for computer time and for each page I printed . That is a very out ##dated approach to patron ' s use of your technology . Such a small thing that they should change . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful time ##less hotel in a f ##abulous location . This hotel o ##oz ##es charm but with modern convenience ##s . My room was q ##ua ##int but s ##ty ##lish and I love the convenience of text ##ing the hotel front desk . P ##lent ##y of outlets , light , and water pressure . The sink while s ##ty ##lish was highly imp ##ractical and trying to fill the iron with water was impossible . The walls are paper thin which I discovered when waking up at midnight to hear the neighbors having sex . Really ? ! Luckily the a / c popped on and drowned out the noise but I ’ m still horrified . T ##ruly a charming hotel but I ’ d recommend leaving the children at home and bringing ear ##p ##lug ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We would definitely come back to this hotel . We chose it for a weekend stay and everything was great , nice de ##cor , good v ##ibes . Location is very convenient , close to beach , river walk , Randolph and Fulton Market restaurants . Staff is nice and the idea of 5 - 6 ##pm social ##izing with free Pro ##se ##co and Sang ##ria only ads positive points to this hotel . The room was clean , a little bit smaller than Kim ##pton Gray for example but for one night stay for couple we did not need anything more . We did not have a chance to check the bar as we stayed somewhere else for drinks so I cannot review the bar but maybe next time . I love the comfort of Kim ##pton hotel beds , they are top of the line , leaving you relaxed during your night sleep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay at this property . The hotel is very warm and friendly overall . Clean and comfortable . The beds were really co ##zy . The front desk staff was so helpful and friendly especially a gentleman named Dan . Live ##ly little bar and a restaurant that is going th ##ru some positive transformation . The location is perfect . A few steps off Rush Street and a couple blocks off Michigan Ave . Shopping and sites to visit all very close . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best of the best - High ##ly recommended . You will be very happy when you just step in the hotel entrance In the lobby . The staff ##s are extremely nice and warm welcome . The breakfast and the social period provide the wonderful catering . I do not have to go to any other places . . . . [SEP]

1	[CLS] I booked the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel on hotels . com and it indicated city view room . When I checked into the hotel , I was given a room facing a wall . I paid USD 35 ##3 for one night . Room ##s are small . One reason you can stay at this hotel is that it is close to all the major attraction in Chicago . Happy hours were okay . Breakfast was good . For recommendations , you can also explore other options as per your convenience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is blessed by its location which is enough to overcome its tired and d ##rab de ##cor . If you want to feel like you are in Moscow , this is the hotel to stay at . Room ##s are very dark . People are nice . And they try hard . So that counts ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] . . . the H ##ya ##tt Regency has it all - was here for a conference - am here many times and always , the place is clean , updated and the hotel offers a lot . Nothing from the highest marks here . Love ##d the ' quiet ' for sleeping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having stayed in this hotel twice before while visiting Chicago why would we stay anywhere else . The hotel is amazing especially the bar area , the ceiling is a complete work of art as is the stairway and paintings . Love it here . Great safe atmosphere . The rooms are lovely and spacious with very com ##fy beds . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a perfectly comfortable hotel where the staff attempt to give one a slightly warmer welcome than in most similar US hotels , and the room service food seemed a little better than usual . The gym is good and the situation good . We had pleasant drinks outside after dinner . Otherwise , nothing special about this generally satisfactory place . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has a good location and a beautiful lobby . But other than that , there is absolutely no reason to stay here . At check in time , i asked if they provided room service and the front desk person said yet . She failed to tell me they D ##O NO ##T provide room service for breakfast ! ! ! which is when I need it ! The food is me ##dio ##cre , the rooms are badly out ##dated , and if you have Hilton status , they still won ' t upgrade you . No reason to stay here . Other Hilton ##s are far better managed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] stayed there for a weekend , I ' ve always enjoyed the Kim ##pton chain . it ' s clean , friendly staff , but like any other Chicago hotel , expensive parking . the rooms are nice and spacious , a little old fashion for my taste but its a bout ##ique hotel . staying in the city , bring you closer to the lifestyle and night ##life . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is such a beautiful hotel located at the North end of Downtown right by Northwestern University and The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Room ##s are amazing and the bathroom is super modern . The staff members were very friendly and helpful . We parked in the garage across the street for $ 42 for 24 hours . We overheard the staff speaking of the 12th floor having a " Spirit . " There really is no need to have a car if you are plan ##ing on seeing the sights of downtown . Most attractions are at most two - three miles away . You can walk , take a bus or use a service like U ##ber . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . clean rooms . Co ##m ##fy beds . amazing shower ! Super staff ! Couldn ' t beat the price . The location was perfect ! Will definitely return ! Pay for parking before ##hand or park across the street to save money . Would highly recommend this place ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ided to stay at the Palmer house not realizing the size and stature of this hotel . I was a bit di ##sp ##lea ##sed with the small size of the room , but we were not there to stay inside . Our room was right off the hall from the elevators so we heard them all night . Love ##d the look of the hotel , but the hotel floors are a simple maze but can be confusing . Unless you get a v ##ip room with single elevator access . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a lovely stay at The Talbot ##t over Valentine ##s weekend . Cut ##e bout ##ique style hotel in the Gold Coast . Large room with beautifully renovated bathroom , bed was very comfortable . Staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and very friendly . At ##tem ##pted to order breakfast but they were backed up and not able to deliver before check ##out . [SEP]
0	[CLS] When I stay in Chicago , this is my favorite place to stay . I am always treated well , and it ’ s close to lots of things I enjoy doing . The rooms are spot ##less and the employees are super friendly . Michael Jordan ##s and Star ##bu ##cks are both lively places to un ##wind . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for three nights and loved it ! Great location - easy walk to many attractions and public transportation . A block from the best art museum in the US ! Super helpful Con ##sign ##or staff . Co ##m ##fy beds and the lobby is world class . Not sure I ' d recommend the $ 42 upgrade to " Executive level " though - really the only thing that got us was a continental breakfast , but it was so crowded you could not sit down to eat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d this hotel , beautiful , different holiday de ##cor , friendly , helpful staff , clean , nice rooms , perfect for a girls trip ! ! Great location , easy , safe walk to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! Perfect choice ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am not sure which is more impressive . . . the staff or the accommodation ##s . The staff upgraded our room because it was our anniversary . We received a suite on the ninth floor that had views and was very spacious . Later they sent compliment ##ary chocolate ##s . The suite configuration allows you to close off the bedroom . Very nice if someone wants to go to bed early . There were several t ##v ##s in the suite . The bed was fantastic ##ally comfortable . The room was quiet . The central location is in easy walking distance of several restaurants and a small grocery store with many take out items . Within a few blocks you could walk to the river tours or go shopping . The con ##cier ##ge was very helpful . We will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stop ##ped in the bar with a friend before the theater for a quick drink Our bartender , Raphael served a great cocktail . Fast and friendly service . Will stop again when we go to the Cadillac theater again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was very clean . Check in staff was exceptional ! Great central location to everything in Chicago . Wonderful trip ! Everyone was very helpful . The hotel cleaning service was very good , and the staff very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is located at the Gold Coast district , surrounded with high - end stores . Walking distance to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and steps from the nearest subway . P ##lent ##y of good restaurants . I would like to give a shout - out to R ##oan ##a Baxter , Chef Con ##cier ##ge at Talbot ##t . She gave us very helpful tips on how we could go about exploring Chicago . She made us feel welcome . She asked us about our it ##iner ##ary for the week and commented on each so we could have the best and safe ##st experience in Chicago . Very professional and friendly . She reflects the overall attitude of the entire staff . A service with a smile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk / registration people were great and well trained . Bell desk and restaurant people were not kind and often seemed not m ##uc ##j interested in helping out guests . Breakfast ( $ 19 for continental ) was very disappointing . There were may other options available outside the hotel though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I thought for the price of the room that many things were lacking - no waste basket in the bathroom , no in - room safe , and house ##keeping was barely adequate . The location is good for the Art Institute and theaters . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a wonderful , historic hotel located near great shopping and the theater district . A warm and welcoming staff at every stop , great lobby bar atmosphere and comfortable rooms with great beds ! Hard to beat this special hotel property ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel frequently for business and don ’ t often come across exceptional service in a hotel . Mostly , I check in , go to my room , work , go to meetings via my rental car , taxi or ride share and rarely see any hotel staff , other than seeing someone in the hallway and them greeting me . At the Intercontinental , they were 100 % service oriented , making me feel taken care of . The door ##men are f ##abulous and the location can ’ t be beat . The room was super clean and comfortable . The AC was a little loud for me , it that ’ s about the only construct ##ive thing I can add , in terms of improvements . I want to go back right now . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great spot for families . Our suite was clean , updated , and spacious enough . Dec ##ent breakfast . Even though we ended up no using it much , it was great to have a kitchen and living area separate from the bedroom so that we could put our baby down to sleep early . Good location close to the subway , restaurants , and downtown attractions . The only minor down ##side is that the elevator often took a very long time . We would stay here again if back in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a business trip to Chicago and brought my wife and teenage daughters with me . The Ambassador was recommended by friend . We loved it ! A ##wes ##ome location , excellent service and beautiful neighborhood . We highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel . Great location . Had a suite with connecting room for co workers . Bad idea ! ! ! Suite ’ s all wrap around the elevator which never stops and has a horrible rat ##tle ! ! ! ! They turn off the elevator form 10 - 7 . Su ##pp ##ose ##dly . Ho ##rrible ! ! ! ! ! They did not clean our room until I called and requested after the third day ! ! Very disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved staying at this hotel , the location was prime and the staff was great . The only downfall that I can think of was the noise from the ambulance going to the nearby hospital was annoying since it is such a busy hospital . If you can manage to ignore that then you are going to love your stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for an event at Millennium Park . The location is perfect since it ' s right across from the park on the north side . The room is larger than normal . The bathroom has a big tub and decent sized shower . The bed is very com ##fy . We felt like we were sleeping on clouds . Would definitely come back and stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just checked in an hour ago - and am dread ##ing spending 3 nights here . The room is O ##LD , very weird ##ly designed . Two double beds , huge room , 2 sets of closet ##s and 2 full bathroom ##s . Sounds good - but to me it ' s just weird . Date ##d carpet ##ing , very dated bed linen ##s . Big travel ##er pet p ##ee ##ve - the desk is facing one wall - the TV is on the complete opposite wall so your back is to it . Do they not test with business travelers who have to work in the evenings ? Final huge com ##pliant - the desk and related chair are so off from any er ##gon ##omi ##c fit it ' s crazy . I am a tall person , and am literally reaching UP to the keyboard to work on my lap top because the chair is so low . I will not return and do not recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They called me at my room just after arriving to check how is my room . I told them it ’ s little small for me my pregnant wife and my 5 ##ye ##ars old kid . They made an upgrade immediately . Special thanks to ( Julius Do ##xy ) at front desk for lovely SMS ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here with my partner just in the build up to Christmas . This hotel is fairly q ##ua ##int and is very close to the famous Michigan Ave . The rooms are a good size and the bathroom and shower are decent too . Show ##er gel etc was provided . In terms of location , this hotel is great . It is a short walk to the Hancock tower ( less than 5 min ##s ) and the shore of Lake Michigan are also about 5 - 10 min ##s away . The ' bean ' is roughly a 20 min walk or 5 min taxi journey away . I would stay here again if I visited Chicago in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this central ##ly located hotel when we were in town for a wedding . The hotel was lovely . . . staff could have been a little nice ##r , but I guess that ' s just part of being in Chicago . We were able to enjoy a lot of restaurants and more importantly , amazing shopping ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kind of surprised no microwave in the room . Maybe not a problem for some but for me it would have helped a lot because I was stuck in the room for most of the stay . Just thought every hotel / motel had one . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel had a beautiful marble entrance and felt elegant and co ##zy at the same time . Great bar , great food , we had breakfast and it was all delicious , great rooms , plenty of space even though there were 3 of us and the hotel was in a great location ! ! When you came out of the front door you could see the lake at the bottom of the street . It was a lovely neighbourhood with great restaurants and shops . The staff were lovely and I couldn ’ t find fault ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] All the hotel amenities are clean and well - kept . There are plenty of great food and drink choices within the hotel . While there is plenty to do away from the hotel , the hotel has much to offer for a relaxing trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago is an older re ##mo ##del ##ed building with a lot of charm and is located right by the lake near Navy Pier so it is very close to many attractions . The rooms are a bit small but very nice and the bed was great . S ##pen ##d a little more and get a Lake View room on one of the Executive Level ##s . We were on the 23rd floor facing the lake and the view was spectacular . Park ##ing is V ##ER ##Y expensive but after all it is Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we have stayed at this hotel many times but this will be the last . Over the years we have had many excellent stays here but the last two were not good . We were celebrating our grandson ' s 10th birthday . very disappointing stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was everything and more ! Great location and friendly staff . My husband and I were surprised with a nice note and two pieces of cheese ##cake in our room for our anniversary . Hotel bar was a great before and after dinner spot . Ra ##fa the bartender was at ##ten ##tive and friendly . He helped us find a place for dinner by suggesting a few of his favorites . Hotel con ##cier ##ge was helpful in getting us reservations as well . Would definitely stay again ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I would like to send this review out to the Front Des ##k staff especially Miss Kenya . Everyone was friendly and professional but her at ##ten ##tive ##ness to any detail was outstanding . Not only to myself but to my work colleagues . And I wanted to bring her work et ##hic to your attention . I definitely will return and recommend staying there to my other colleagues . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very large , well maintained , conference style hotel in a nice area of Chicago ( across from Grant Park , down the street from Millennium Park and close to many attractions . ) Although I understand that at some point the hotel was renovated and went from 3000 rooms to a little over 1500 rooms , the rooms were still a little small . We received a Hilton honors upgrade to a room on the 21st floor that had two bathroom ##s which turned out to be extremely convenient . Overall , a nice day and we would return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chicago is alive ! Theatre ##s , lands ##cap ##ing , restaurants , shopping for personal and home . Great safe running routes , walking distance to most places we need . The street entertainment is amazing , a few homeless sad individuals but do not ha ##rass anyone . I will continue to visit Chicago and other states where the O ##m ##ni is available . Every trip to Chicago has been an excellent visit . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent Hotel . It appeared to be new or recently renovated and is completely modern , clean , and accessible . The hotel is surrounded by great shopping and restaurants . I used rides ##hare services so I can ' t speak to proximity to public transit but you could walk to a lot of cool stuff . it ' s price ##y but there are deals to be had and it is downtown Chicago after all . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service and hotel , from check in to maid service we were very impressed . Fast elevators meant you never had to wait event though we were on the 31 floor . I would recommend for business or pleasure . location is great , walking distance to many of Chicago ' s attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over ##p ##rice ##d with few free amenities . The hotel didn ’ t provide a shuttle to the airport . This may not be the norm downtown , but it would be helpful . The hotel rooms need microwave ##s so you warm up any purchased food . The staff was very court ##eous and always greeted us and opened the door . Overall , I would probably not recommend the hotel because of lack of value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We did not do a lot in the hotel but felt it was perfect for the location . The staff was friendly and the hotel had a upper class " Old Chicago " feel ! We were able to board the Big Bus Tour Red Route in front of the hotel . We were walking distance to Field Museum , Adler Planet ##arium , and She ##dd A ##qua ##rium . We were able to leave our car at hotel and use the red route to get to our locations . The hotel room was in front of the hotel and overlooked the lake . Room was large and spacious for a family of four . Having a Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby was a plus ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing to complain about at the She ##rato ##n , really . It ' s an OK business ##person ' s hotel , with all the amenities you ' d expect for the ( substantial ) price you pay . My problem is that it ' s aging and offers nothing special . Ex ##ample - - the casual dining re ##s ##ra ##ura ##nt , while it has a nice rivers ##ide terrace , offers a very basic b ##urger - driven menu . For much more style s ##t similar cost ( including more im ##agi ##nat ##ive restaurants ) head across the bridge to the Ra ##dis ##son Blu - - a newer property that has real personality . I attended a conference there while staying at the She ##rato ##n - - the contrast in atmosphere and the attitudes of the staff was quite noticeable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing architecture and history . Room ##s are a bit dated , but large considering the building . Small bathroom . Good TV and small fridge . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . Check - in and check ##out not the best . . . long lines and sur ##ly reception . Even though I am frequent customer of this chain . There were hotel employee protesters the week of my stay , so I never got house ##keeping and no room service - but that was because of the strike . I had a m ##t ##g cancel and wanted to leave early , and the front desk was glad to change my date , but still charge me for the room . R ##id ##ic ##ulous way to treat a frequent club member . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is beautiful with the customer service and clean ##liness I have always expected from Hilton . It ’ s a great location to walk to all the main attractions like Willis , 360 , the bean , and river tours . You must try the brown ##ie , it is beyond delicious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location inside the loop . Fun de ##cor , clean and great service . The bathroom is pretty small . It is in the heart of the theater district but also not too far to walk to great shopping and restaurants . Also very close to train . [SEP]
1	[CLS] K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is located at a very convenient location and was a fairly quiet hotel compared to a few I ' ve been to before . Everything is within walking distance - waterfront , well - known restaurant chains , convenient store , mall ##s , etc . Upon our arrival on our first day ( Friday ) and departure on the 3rd day ( Sunday ) , the service at the reception has been great . If you ' re always out and about exploring the city , this hotel will definitely meet your needs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been staying at this hotel every year since 2004 . They have made many upgrades to the common areas and maintain it ' s historic charm . However , only once in this time ##frame have the rooms been fully upgraded . My room this visit featured blind ##s in need of repair , chair / o ##tto ##man in need of replacement , a shower that lacked a working mix valve , insufficient hot water pressure , p ##eel ##ing paint around door edges and wall ##paper and worst was the r ##ust ##ed metal at the bottom of the van ##ity . This is a wonderful property that seems to now be most interested in profit generation than excellent hospitality , the lack of attention to fine details in the room was truly disappointing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I took a weekend get - away in Chicago and stayed at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . The location is great ( 2 blocks from Water Tower Place ) with many good restaurants near - by . The staff was helpful and pleasant . The room was beautifully appointed and clean as could be . The lobby is gorgeous , and the bar had a piano player during the pre dinner hours . This is a great value ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was great . There is a restaurant and bar in the front . Vale ##t parking is at least 57 . 00 for a 24 hour period so keep that in mind when booking hotels down town Chicago . No pool . Close to River ##walk and shopping . You can see the Navy Pier from some of the rooms . Room ##s were nice and the bathroom had a shower and a tub both . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights and including New Years Eve Great location Room was excellent Large well lit bathroom was great Will be back Bar and restaurant in lobby are very convenient Staff was all very a ##cco ##mada ##ting [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here a number of times when we come to town for Black ##hawk games , the theater , or just to get away . The cost , the location , and the friend ##liness of the staff are exceptional ( Mona and Derrick ) . If you are a walk ##er , it is very easy to walk to attractions both north and south . The continental breakfast is more than enough to send one out for the day , and the wine / beer in the evening is a plus . Then , too , the discount at the Public House next door is great for a drink or light meal . Park ##ing fees are steep , but they can be reduced by using Spot Hero for nearby parking garage ##s if you don ' t want to go in and out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly people . Great customer service ! Perfect location . AM ##A ##Z ##ING swimming pool and j ##ac ##uz ##zi . Pretty nice view and wonderful food . I took my family of 5 and we had a wonderful time definitely recommend this place ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] No parking — what a has ##sle and something I expect at what is supposed to be a higher end hotel . Room ##s are old and nothing special . Lam ##p shade too short so bright light bulb shining in my eyes . Front desk person at check in was short & cu ##rt . Su ##mming it up , location good but not worth the extra money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Crow ##ded hotel , room are ve ##y tide and not con ##fort ##able . The b ##uff ##et in the morning is very good and service is very friendly . Next time will check on the type of room . . . . it was tight and noisy , the location is very good particular ##y in winter since a lot of good restaurant are very close by ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is a two star hotel in a four star location which is why I rated it three stars . It ’ s located off Michigan avenue amongst lots of shopping and dining options . I took the Michigan avenue bus for a quick ride to Millennium Park - it ’ s worth the trip . The hotel itself is dated . The lighting in the bathroom is sub par . There are minimal toilet ##ries provided . I arrived prior to check in and was provided a room at an additional cost . While the bar area in the lobby is si ##zable , it ’ s far from inviting . The lobby offers little to accommodate the business travel ##er . Not a good option for my future travels to ch ##ica ##go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is right in the heart of River North , with shopping , restaurants , bars , and museums all within walking distance . We did not need our car for the duration of our stay . Unfortunately one of the 2 elevators was out of service and required a major repair , so this caused delays for the guests . The staff is very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pen ##d two nights for a business trip . Only one restaurant opened during evening for dining or it ' s room service . A ##rri ##ved in evening and wasn ' t up to going to their high end restaurant so it was room service . Also Sur ##prise ##d my internet connection was not the best and a convention there meant quite a noisy night . Was awakened twice . Yi ##kes . Clean and great location though . Perhaps if in tourist mode I might have enjoyed more rather than on right business schedule . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of my colleagues stayed at the hotel during the Chicago ##C ##oll ##ec ##tive Show We had a major problem getting the shipment ( D ##HL ) to the hotel from Italy . Melissa went out of her way to help , organize and successfully receive our shipment , what a service ! ! ! T ##HA ##N ##K YOU K ##IN ##Z ##IE H ##OT ##EL AND T ##HA ##N ##K YOU ME ##L ##IS ##SA ! ! ! You guys saved our show ! ! Not to mention the level of service to Roy at the hotel , again everyone from the front / reception staff to the Hotel Manager . You can tell , the leadership understands the excellence of customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was great - really good location , great service . The only thing to mention is that the sofa bed is NO ##T sleep ##able . You could feel each and every wire through the thin mattress . . . ended up sleeping on the floor instead . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I booked this hotel for a weekend of exploring in Chicago . The location is fantastic ! Clean room , friendly staff , very reasonable price . Can ' t complain ! Always love the free breakfast at Home ##wood Suite ##s : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the Palmer House . She ' s a grand old lady w / a gorgeous interior . But up - to - date accommodation ##s : very comfortable bed , nice size room , great public lounge / lobby w / a com ##fy bar that has friendly bar tender ##s & classic drinks . The location is superb for seeing Chicago ' s sites . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Reason ##able price for an outstanding location . Friendly and helpful staff . G ##ym has older equipment but is clean . Nice that the room had a separate sleeping area and a sitting area . High ##ly recommend for a Chicago get away ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Palmer House Hilton was a perfect choice for our Chicago trip . It ’ s a gorgeous old - fashioned hotel , the service was wonderful . Just down the street from the C ##IB ##C Theatre , which worked great for us to see Hamilton . There are lots of restaurants nearby , and it ’ s an easy walk to the Art Institute and Millennium Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After a long flight we arrived to be greeted by friendly reception staff . Check ##ed in all ok although a little difficult to get my free W ##i - fi as I ##H ##G member . This was down I think to register ##ing in UK . Staff very helpful in solving the issue . Room upgrade to river view which was excellent and much appreciated when not able to sleep to watch very early morning Chicago . I would recommend the hotel to anyone as a great location when visiting , central to see all sights and catch hop on hop off bus . Had a meal here a couple of times very good but would have liked fish and chips on our first evening but only available at lunch time which was a great shame . Bart ##ender on at lunch time was a wonderful g ##ent and made a great cocktail to go with the lunch ##time fish and chips next day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C stay in one of the corner suites and would highly recommend . The views of the river and Lake Michigan were amazing and the special treats we ordered from room service were spectacular ! A great , romantic , stay ##cation here in Chicago - just the thing for a special treat in these Co ##vid times . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location in river north just a block from the river and 1 / 2 mi , e to the lake . Close to lots of restaurants and things to do . Very safe area . Perhaps the best is their staff . They can and will assist you with just about anything you need or want . Nice expanded continental breakfast and an evening wine / beer reception . Great shower and com ##fy beds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a nice 2 - night stay here ; the rooms are large , the prices are reasonable , the location is great , and the staff is super friendly and helpful . I ' d happily stay here on future visits . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Luckily found a good deal for this hotel and were very happy with it . Location is good for getting anywhere either by public transport or U ##ber or on foot . Staff all nice . The room was clean and com ##fy bed . No noise from the city within the room . They got us a small fridge when we asked for one for our room and everything was spot on for our weeks stay . The gym was a decent size and they had water there to fill your bottle . If you get up early enough you can catch the compliment ##ary coffee and c ##rois ##san ##ts . We didn ’ t eat at the hotel but we found many great eats close to the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s an okay hotel but what you ’ re really paying for is the name and location which is fantastic . The rooms are entirely too small and not worth the price in my opinion . There are several more options just right down the street with better amenities that won ’ t cost an arm and a leg . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here before . I had noted that The Fu ##git ##ive was filmed in here , and I stayed back in late 80s . Now I was in town for the Rock n Roll Chicago running race . This proved to be an excellent location especially given the s ##cor ##ching temperatures . Easy walking access to The Bean , Buckingham Fountain , Willis Tower and the subway . It was convenient and exactly what was needed for a long weekend . Room was as expected ; larger than NYC size , but smaller than Toronto . Still it was clean and comfortable . Would recommend for others to use . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Opera ##ted 170 + room 16 floor hotel with only one working elevator . I was very disappointed . The hotel claimed that the second elevator recently broke down ; however , I spoke with several hotel employees and a regular hotel guest who explained that the second elevator is rarely working and continually breaks down . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Real good experience . Close to everything downtown . The food was good but a little price ##y . It did get a little crazy with the all the conventions and meeting going on . I would re ##come ##nd this hotel to by friends and family . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a f ##abulous place to stay if you ' re in Chicago . Close to everything ! The hospitality is above and beyond with the staff doing everything possible to make your stay special . Special shout out to the Gold Lounge staff ! What special people . Pat ##ric ##io was always cord ##ial and couldn ' t do enough to make the guests feel special . Mu ##gi was exceptional and helped me with rides and reservations at top restaurants . When I go back , I will stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this location many times - we find the location , the people , and the hotel all to be wonderful ! Especially when traveling with our daughter it is nice to have a room with a separate bedroom and 2 TV ##s . All of the staff that we have encountered at this location have been incredible . The included breakfast always has food that we like . This hotel also has easy access to the train - walk one block down and straight shot to W ##rig ##ley and other locations from there . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a 3 night weekend stay for the Chicago Marathon . The location was great , easy walking distance to the start coral ##s . We had a king room and the bed was very comfortable . Room ##s were not huge and the room we stayed in only had a desk and one chair . Would have been better if there was another place to sit . The rooms did not have a coffee maker but you can request one from the front desk . Very important if you are waking before dawn to run 26 . 2 miles . He staff was very nice and helpful . The attached restaurant was quiet and comfortable and a great place to take it easy . I would definitely recommend it for the marathon and vacation visits . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The first person we met at the Talbot Hotel was D ##wayne , a guest specialist . He immediately made my wife Kathy and me feel comfortable and offered us parking advice that saved us $ 20 . He then helped us with our luggage and made a number of valuable suggestions that we found useful . I asked him if my tip was appropriate . His response was , " Did it come from your heart " ? I said it did , and he said that was good enough for him . It was a great introduction to our Chicago visit . Love that guy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] we stayed there for the Chicago marathon . Its very close to the magnificent mile . C ##ab ##s to the Expo - Center was 14 $ . The millennium park is in walking stance , about a mile away . It was no problem to get a roll in bed for the kids additionally . Nice pool and j ##ac ##uz ##zi at the fitness center [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed one of the finest views we ' ve ever had from a high rise hotel - both the river , many high rises , and the river / lake could be seen from our windows . Great customer service from staff . We were sad there was no hotel hot tub , only a small pool . With the very cold weather we experienced we would have loved to enjoy a hotel hot tub / j ##ac ##uz ##zi , but al ##as , there wasn ' t one . Great meeting spaces and the hotel provided excellent food and great food servers for our conference gatherings . Great location in the city . Will stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall , this was one of the best hotel stays I ' ve ever had . I didn ' t feel like I was simply checking into a room but that I actually had a staff that was concerned about the quality of my stay and my comfort . Would highly recommend and I will be back if I come back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was perfect and dog friendly . This was important because I was traveling with my dog and needed a k ##iche ##tte . Location was perfect to get to a park ( ~ 15 - 20 min ##s ) . All the staff were friendly and helpful . Nice King bed and comfortable pull out bed in living room . El ##eva ##tors and w ##if ##i was good for us , didn ' t have to wait long or no connections . Breakfast was fine but would have liked wa ##ffles or pan ##cakes as another item to select from ( hope you add in a wa ##ffle maker and just provide batter ) . Didn ' t part ##ake on the social evening food . . . was not too keen on the choices but no issues . . . just step out or order in restaurants all close by . When we visit again will definitely stay at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visit Chicago on an annual basis and bring our entire family . We book multiple rooms . We are never disappointed by this hotel . Great location and accommodation ##s are top notch . We ' ve never been disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small room , but was perfect for our needs . This hotel was in a great location to everything . The double deck ##er bus was only a half block away so it was an easy walk . Breakfast was included and it was f ##abulous ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gold suite for 6 nights with my wife and two kids . Previously stayed here in a " normal " suite two years ago . Can see the positive and detailed differences between " normal " and gold " as the same suite location - just a different floor . All the staff were great and cater ##ed to our every need . Gold Super ##visor Mu ##gi was exceptional and even went out of his way to suggest ideas on various topics , let alone just great to chat with also - not pre ##ten ##ti ##ous as in a number of other various " lounge situations " . He was great with our kids and that always makes a great impression . Could not com ##men ##d the staff enough ! Lounge was nice to be in - great spread of food at all times including the cheese ##cakes between 8 - 10 ##pm : ) We look forward to coming back . Mu ##gi , Jesus and staff - thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted this hotel on business and it was a lovely hotel with great service and a f ##abulous location . I love Kim ##pton ##s - they are always unique and fun , while catering well to business travelers and vacation ##ers alike . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My fi ##an ##cé and I are getting married next year in the brand new Swiss ##ote ##l ballroom . We visited to do our tasting and had a fantastic experience with Veronica and Chef Lu ##L ##u . The team helping us were very organized and professional . We were blown away by the individual ##ized menu and the chef had even researched my fi ##an ##cé ' s restaurant for inspiration . My mom was worried the food would be boring , normal wedding food but was so excited to see a menu that reflected our love of food and eating ! We have stayed here twice now and the co ##zy lobby basically feels like home now . Can ' t wait for our big day at the Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was an awesome trip with excellent staff - your bartender was very friendly and had our drinks right away - the gentleman that took our luggage showed us our room and explained things and told us where to get info if we needed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love going back in time at grand places such as this hotel and it ’ s sister , the Palmer House . It ’ s fun to sample the el ##egan ##ce of another era while still able to access modern essential ##s . This was another perfect stay , no complaints or issues , and my complement ##s to the staff and management for striking an appropriate balance between old and new . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was awesome . We had a king room with a wonderful city view . Love the breakfast on each floor - that is extremely convenient . En ##joy ##ed the city and slept well with all the great amenities Ki ##nz ##ie has to offer . Staff was excellent , although we only used them for Check - in and Check - out . Door ##men were friendly and knowledge ##able about the happening ##s around town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location Great Room Great Service Great Dr ##ink ##s Room ##s are stunning I was on the 25th floor in a corner room with a view of the city , bed is very comfortable , desk services were outstanding ! ! ! ! I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel and look forward to my next visit [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted Chicago with wife and 2 small children . Very good hotel for kids . Nice space and central ##ly located . Also staff were very pleasant and helpful . Matt ##ress on the sofa bed however was a bit hard and thin . Other than that a good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A guys trip for baseball and fun . The location is great for eating , drinking and baseball games at W ##rig ##ley . It is an older property , but very well maintained . The staff were great . Second time staying here and will come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room layout was great and the size of the room and kitchen ##ette was big but could stand for a little update . The breakfast was me ##dio ##cre at best - and they have the slow ##est elevators I ' ve ever seen . . . . . . however ; the location and price were a substantial value . The hotel is located blocks from great dining and bars and the service was great . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and nicely upgraded rooms . I stayed here for 133 nights . My room had the best view of Chicago . My favorite people at this Hilton were the Vale ##t , Breakfast Staff , and House ##keeping . Keep up the good work ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check - in : Long line Room : Good and spacious . I don ' t like carpet ##s , though . Clean ##ing : Good Internet : medium - un ##se ##cure Bar : Good . The location and the history of the hotel and nice . The internet should have a password protected access . It ' s about time to start re ##fu ##rb ##ishing and getting rid of the carpet ##s in the rooms . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We really enjoyed the Home ##wood Suite ##s in Chicago . Great hotel , great location ! We will be back ! The room was very spacious and a great place for a family . The complementary breakfast had everything for our family plus the staff was really great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the second year in a row that I ##´ ##ve stayed there . The attention of bell ##boy and reception is just ok . Although the servers and kitchen people , very good . Mostly what I like is how close it is from everything , easy to walk to a lot of places and the rooms are very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For being close to Millennium Park it was actually reasonably priced - better value than some other lesser / similar level brands . Re ##ception could have been a little better in pointing out lifts , especially given the partial o ##bs ##cu ##ring of the signs given renovation works . Good sized twin room with several windows , nice features and ample sized bathroom with separate shower . Rate included breakfast which had an ample variety on the b ##uff ##et . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You must experience the O ##m ##ni , the staff are wonderful , helpful and friendly . The rooms are spacious , and most of all very clean . Bath ##rooms are clean , and water pressure and temperature are great . We will always stay at the O ##m ##ni when we travel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are out ##dated . Too dark , bad lights , no coffee machine / water cattle , no fridge , no compliment ##ary W ##IF ##I , bath room could have been used by Al Cap ##one the night before . In conclusion , poor value for money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel room but could have been cleaner We ordered room service $ $ $ $ the coffee was horrible they forgot to bring water and I had to go to the front desk to get it we just were not impressed the front desk was not real helpful [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is ideal ##ly situated just one block off Michigan Ave so very close to all shops & Millennium Park & only about 45 min ##s away on the AT ##C Blue line train from O ’ Hare get off at Washington & walk about 3 blocks to Michigan Ave then your there & only $ 3 Great rooms with great views ( obviously depending on which side you are ) friendly staff & nothing is too much trouble , we visited for our wedding anniversary & received a bottle of champagne in our room on arrival . Also close to Egg ##y ’ s which is great for breakfast ( read my review ) so all in all a great place in a great location for all your plans in Chicago . Thanks guys & we ’ ll be back when in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was in a good location for us so that was a plus but there were a few things that left us a bit disappointed . For one , the beds were uncomfortable . I would like to sleep through the night but we both woke up in the middle of the night with sore backs . The floors ( carpet ##s ) in the room were a bit filthy as was the shower curtain . To ##we ##ls were scratch ##y . The last night of our stay , we came back in the room after it was cleaned and found a dirty wash cloth in the sink . . . it looked like they used the wash cloth to clean the bathroom and left it so ##pping wet in our sink . Yu ##ck ! Breakfast was $ 30 per person but we had no choice as we needed to eat there on the day of departure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice clean Hotel ! Within walking distance of many things . Very well sound proof ##ed from Chicago street noise and other guests . Nice breakfast on your floor steps away and cocktail ##s included . Co ##m ##fy beds , very well decorated and well lit spacious bathroom . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will stay there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at H ##ya ##tt which was to accommodate guest that came far and near for AI ##U graduation . Besides being on opposite wings from most of our guest - we really had a blast . The only down ##side no microwave , no breakfast discount or fridge to keep take ##out cold . Overall we had a blast ! Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are not sound proof ##ed . Do no stay here if you are a light sleep ##er . I heard every conversation from the room next to mine and the toilet flush ##ing from the surrounding rooms . There ' s also a fire station across the road and I could hear every departure . It was awful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were at the H ##ya ##tt for a conference at the H ##ya ##tt . Other than that it was near the elevators , the room was perfect . The hotel provided a lot of assistants for helping conference attendees find rooms and other venues . While always a bust ##ling den of activity , everything was fast . I couldn ' t believe how quickly they fed so many people at the b ##uff ##et lunch or how many they could get up and down stairs so quickly . They have created many great no ##ok ##s for hanging out or working downstairs . The work ##out area has many t ##read ##mill ##s , but nothing else other than a f ##abulous view . On the negative side : I do not love ex ##or ##bit ##antly priced food ( water for over $ 8 ) being placed in front of me in the room , tempting me to spend un ##rea ##son ##able amounts on items I could grab with a two minute walk downstairs . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first time at this Hotel and I must say everything went perfect . Very friendly staff , clean and felt safe . The front desk was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The view of the city was perfect and walking distance to Navy Pier , and just about every other major site and attraction . I would 100 % recommend a stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This place is amazing . St ##un ##ning to look at , staff are friendly , rooms are incredible , food is un ##believable and the location is ideal . There is so much history here it will blow your mind . This place is for sure our new main stay place in Chicago . Special shout out to Dan Kirk ##ey who went above and beyond to make sure we had such a luxury stay ! Couldn ' t recommend this place any higher . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ambassador Chicago is a jewel in a beautiful , safe and friendly neighbourhood . The staff is welcoming and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , as well as eager to help in any way possible . Thanks to Travis Howard , the Guest Relations Manager , we experienced the best blues club in Chicago , Kingston Mines , and a fun crimes tour which brought us to Di ##lling ##er ’ s demise and the scene of the Valentine ’ s Day massacre . He also informed us of the best Architecture River Cruise . He along with the entire staff made our stay comfortable and un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble . He also treated us to two delicious cocktail ##s on our last night . Guess where I ’ m staying on my next visit to Chicago . You got it ! The Ambassador ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We come to Chicago every year around Christmas and stay at the Intercontinental on Michigan Ave . The staff is always incredibly welcoming , the rooms are fantastic and have great views of the city , and you won ' t be disappointed if you visit the Michael Jordan steak ##house bar right in The lobby ! We ' ve recommended this location to friends and family and they ' ve also shared our enthusiasm . High ##ly recommend this location right in the heart of Chicago ' s Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I typically do not write reviews on hotels , food or otherwise , but I was terribly un ##im ##pressed with the hotel staff / managers ' resolutions to issues that we had during our stay . We stayed in a room where the TV was broken , bath ##tub was c ##log ##ged and the towel rack had broken , and all the manager offered was two free movies to watch . . . once they finally got the TV to work properly . I spoke to another manager hoping to make things right and was offered a free upgrade on my next stay . No thank you , there will not be another stay . And in fact , I ' ve made it clear to my company that this property should be taken off of our list of acceptable hotel options in downtown Chicago . This experience was far below my expectations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] OK , here ' s a tip : don ' t show up at a hotel at 9 a . m . when check - in doesn ' t start until sometime after lunch , like we did . That said , the Hotel Monaco staff was court ##eous and very helpful . My wife inter ##rogate ##d the con ##cier ##ge for what seemed like hours , and the guy loaded her with good information . The desk crews were always very at ##ten ##tive , and the place was spot ##less . Odd ##ly enough , I never saw the house ##keeping staff - - just the results of their work . Great views of the city , particularly if you get a higher floor room facing the river . In this case , the highest floor is 14 stories up , but from there , you can see the river , the House of Blues , Trump ' s place and other stuff . From here , it ' s an easy walk to Millennium Park to see The Bean or to shop on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room amenities reduced due to co ##vid to a level below that expected of a 4 star H ##ya ##tt . No room service . No room cleaning . Not enough toilet ##ries , towels , bed ##ding , drinks or snack ##s . Feel ##s like hotel used co ##vid as an excuse to save money [SEP]
1	[CLS] So glad we upgraded to the gold level to enjoy an extra spacious room and the service in the gold lounge . Full breakfast tea ni ##bble ##s and drinks . Warm welcome by the staff including Man ##dan ##a . Will secure ##ly stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the Mill ##eni ##um K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker at least five times in the last few years . We always enjoy our stay there because you can ’ t beat the price plus it ’ s location . Staff is friendly . Only suggestion , you might want to bring your own pillow ( their pillows are a little too soft / thin ) . Just my opinion . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There is always the temptation to look beyond those " older " hotels that are exceptionally well located and try newer properties . I debated this property versus something newer and opted for the better location . The hotel , which must be well over 30 years old was fresh and comfortable . There is the odd design element that shows its age ( bathroom ##s ) . However , we had a spacious room with a view of the river that was functional and comfortable . This is probably a small thing but some hotels can feel p ##oke ##y based on the size of the corridors . The She ##rato ##n Grand has wide and spacious corridors . making the hotel ( which is large ) feel more like a bout ##ique hotel . We found the staff excellent - very friendly and efficient . Overall an excellent stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was on a trip visiting for the Taste of Chicago . The hotel was at the perfect location . The hotel was B ##EA ##UT ##IF ##U ##L , the bar area was great . The hotel even provided little packages for the kids upon arrival . The de ##cor and space in the room was amazing . The bathroom ##s were awesome and spacious . I highly recommend this hotel , I will be back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My sister and I had a wonderful experience at the Kim ##pton All ##egro Hotel , downtown Chicago ! We want to thank the incredible staff for the friendly reception we received from all the door men , to all the great front desk people , our new b ##ff , Erin , “ our ” front desk person whom we had a special connection with ! They made us feel like we really mattered to them ! We will see you again ! When you stay there , say “ hey ” to Erin from MB and Tri ##cia ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is everything . You are walking distance from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , downtown and eat ##eries . The staff is friendly , the rooms are well maintained and it was a perfect experience . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was the perfect spot for our weekend home - away from home ! George at the front desk was so welcoming and provided great recommendations for food as well as attractions . Every ##day that he saw us , he warmly greeted us by name . Happy hour was H ##AP ##P ##NI ##N ! ! ! Josh had the party on and Pop ##pin ! He moved about the room making sure that all guests felt included . Location was very central . Close to shopping , restaurants and transit . Room ##s and facilities very clean . The support staff at ##ten ##tive and always in ##qui ##ring about our well being . Will def ##inate ##ly return to the Ki ##nz ##ie on my next visit to The Wind ##y City ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton hotels always seem to be at least a little more s ##ty ##lish than other hotels , and this is certainly true for the Monaco . We had a wonderful ##ly comfortable room , very large , with 2 queen beds and 2 fantastic window seats looking out at Chicago ! The beds were very comfortable , the room was quiet , and the thoughtful b ##al ##ck ##out curtains actually made it a little too easy to stay in bed in the morning . The Monaco is in a great location within walking distance to all of the loop and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , plus very close to several El stations . Jo ##in the free k ##im ##pton ka ##rma rewards program and get free w ##if ##i plus a $ 10 bar ( or mini ##bar ) v ##ou ##cher during your stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only people worth the time in that establishment is Corbin Howe ##lda and Rey ##na da ##vila . . . Also the lobby attendant la ##nier Henry was exceptional . the place has no class although its very beautiful . W ##EA ##K ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The new d ##é ##cor at the hotel is wonderful . I was also impressed with how they ' ve re - carpet ##ed the corridors . The location is perfect for getting anywhere in the downtown area . And the employees are great . Especially the folks working during the compliment ##ary breakfast . Love ##d the place ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What lovely and g ##rac ##ious team especially the front desk staff ! Everyone was engaging , smile ##y and eager to assist at all times . Cassie , Leah and Todd were stand ##outs and always greeted me with a smile ! Room ##s are a teen ##y bit on the small side that wouldn ’ t de ##ter me from returning to the All ##egro ! Room was clean , perfectly dark at night and bed was com ##fy ! Thank you to all who assisted me during my short one night stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] fine facility , excellent service , great location with easy access to Ma ##g Mile , Mill ##eni ##um Part ##k and Loop attractions , including Art Institute , Symphony Hall , etc . Look for a good price online . First - class restaurant on ##site , lots of other amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel with amazing staff . . . . friend ##liest in Chicago ! Clean , spacious room with V ##ER ##Y com ##fy beds . . Love , love , love the large window seats to watch the city wake up , or enjoy the city lights at night . Hotel is centered near Michigan Ave . museums , theaters and surrounded by lots of restaurants . Ice cold water with either b ##asi ##l , straw ##berries or cu ##cum ##bers provided round the clock , umbrella ##s provided on rainy days . Just wish coffee makers were in room , then hotel would be perfect . Love ##d this place , we ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] She ##rato ##n Grand was top - notch for our entire stay . From re ##ser ##ving to check - in to extra needs , the staff was great . The g - kids loved the pool [ swimming in ##D ##ec . in Chi . ] . The oldest one , the gym and sa ##una . Location more than filled our needs for proximity to ch ##rist ##mas destinations , Christ ##kind ##lma ##rk ##t , Lights at Lincoln Park Zoo and Winter ##W ##ond ##er ##fest at Navy Pier . Restaurant ##s gal ##ore by foot or short cab ride . Hotel restaurants are also very good . Breakfast b ##uff ##et in the A . M . Shu ##la ' s steak ##s P . M . Low Dec . rates were also a plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a delight to have your room ready at 11 ##am when you are only in town for 3 days . An upgrade to a Fair ##mont Sign ##ature room with a view of Lake Michigan was i ##cing on the cake . Gail , the con ##cier ##ge , couldn ' t have been more helpful . Bed ##s & pillows were com ##fy . Great location . I had stayed there two years ago and had a great experience and would stay there should I head to Chicago again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the money you really can ' t beat it . Didn ' t utilize much of the on ##site amenities since Chicago has so much to offer out side the property . The location can ' t be beat and all of the employees we ' re very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Would recommend and would definitely stay at the O ##m ##ni again [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt in Chicago has a great location ! It is convenient ##ly located along the river and within walking distance to many wonderful attractions . The rooms are nice , and the beds sleep great ! Good food and service at American Craft Kitchen - Vanessa was the best ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby and restaurants are impressive . Like stepping into a 30 ##s / 40 ##s movie set . That is about where the good ends . The rooms are worn out and tiny , the always ho ##rri ##bly uncomfortable Hilton beds are present , and entry and exit areas are s ##warm ##ed by trans ##ients . I was forced to stay here due to corporate reservations out of my control . I would never stay here again by choice . There are better option in the area , by far . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff went above and beyond to accommodate requests . Excellent customer service . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary champagne glass one afternoon . Prime location to walk to sites and restaurants , even at night . Very spacious suite , especially bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is well located in downtown Chicago . From the airport O ' Hare you can easily reach it with the Blue line ( it takes approx . 45 minutes ) . In the morning you can grab au ##ch coffee free of charge . Unfortunately the wardrobe in the rooms are to small . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service at the hotel was excellent . W ##if ##i is perfect . Location of the hotel is great . Room service , all the staff are very kind and helpful ##l . G ##ym is also very good . T ##ne next time I will also prefer this hotel for sure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a beautiful hotel to stay for business or pleasure . Located in Chicago , IL it is one of the best hotels in the city ! En ##joy their views , their restaurant and great service . Pam ##pered all the way once you enter the S ##O ##FI ##TE ##L CH ##IC ##AG ##O ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed at this property many times . Te ##rri ##fic , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . John the door ##man is a g ##em . Always friendly , helpful , and great with recommendations . A great example of a staff that is easy to deal with . Looking forward to coming back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at Swiss ##ote ##l several times . We enjoyed our previous stays and we booked again . We were right to choose Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago ! The hotel is comfortable , clean and most of rooms are with scenery . The staff are kind and very nice , they know their city . The location is great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first time visiting Chicago and our stay at the Talbot ##t couldn ’ t have been better . The ideal downtown location meant we were close to everything we wanted to see and do , but it was peaceful and quiet enough to get a com ##fy night ’ s sleep too . The staff are friendly and at ##ten ##tive , they really want guests to feel at home and to enjoy themselves . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one night for a business meeting . Nice room . A bit expensive , but typical for downtown Chicago hotels . Great location , at the heart of the city . Navy Pier is within walking distance and lots of choices nearby to eat . S ##le ##pt well on a comfortable bed and had a great view from my room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed three nights - we were able to get a nice rate through one of the booking agencies , but you may get a decent deal by calling the hotel directly . It is convenient ##ly located in the Street ##er ##ville area - near Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue . The lobby area is spacious and welcoming , the staff friendly and efficient . We reserved a room with a view of the lake . Oh . My . spectacular view . If you go up to the club lounge , you will have incredible pan ##ora ##mic views of Chicago and the lake . Saturday afternoon was so clear , you could see all the way to the steel mills in Gary Indiana ! But I dig ##ress . Our room was clean , spacious and very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand in Chicago does have a 5 Star location and a nice lobby but the rooms are 1 - 2 star at best . Have stayed at any number of nice ##r Chicago hotels . Pop ##corn ceilings and a 1980s shower tub comb ##o is a little unexpected for a 4 star hotel in the city . The fridge that was completely filled with over ##p ##rice ##d drinks without room for 1 water bottle was un ##usa ##ble . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Location ! Great Staff ! I will be staying at H ##ya ##tt properties from now on ! I loved everything about this H ##ya ##tt property . This is my first time staying at a H ##ya ##tt location and it has exceeded my expectations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Initially asked for almost the same amount of hotel fair for incident ##als but that was quickly sorted out . Did need to pay for the incident ##als . Thanks to the host agent . Great hotel and location . . . m . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a exceptional stay at this hotel . All the staff were pleasant and court ##eous , and made every effort to ensure all my needs were met . The room was very clean and com ##fy in a great location in downtown Chicago . I am a Hilton honors gold status member and this hotel exceeded my expectations ! ! ! ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly a 5 star hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was perfect . However , the room size was a little too small for me to be comfortable . The check - in was very proper and communication was passed down the proper channels because I had a unique problem when checking in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was discount ##ed in my bathroom . One thing i expect is a clean and well kept bathroom . The shower drain was c ##log ##ged and i stood in several inches of water while shower ##ing . It ’ s gross . An easy fix i am surprised house ##keeping didn ’ t catch . Just lazy . But the hotel is beautiful and very cool place to stay . Bar is amazing . Wine list is A + . Will be back and will hope for a better bathroom experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the great welcoming staff , room service , cocktail hour and the well appointed room with window seats , you can ' t beat this hotel . We love the personal attention to each guest and their willingness to accommodate any w ##him ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel . Con ##ven ##ient to the Rush Street area . Staff friendly and welcoming . Room was nice . Bed was comfortable but a bit low . Bath ##room small b ##t functional . This is an older property but very updated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The setting across the street from Grant Park is beautiful . The hotel is still grand with a trained staff who can ’ t seem to do enough to make your stay wonderful . On site cafe and restaurant with a wonderful bar make your stay complete . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Manager Jay was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , he went above and beyond making our experience outstanding ! The service and staff are above excellent . I highly recommend Hilton Chicago ! I have stayed here many times , pleased as usual . Food is always great , classic aesthetic plus excellent friendly staff . The recent updates are beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely very good hotel not only because of location ( 5 minutes from Michigan Ave ) but also because of service , stuff and standard . Room are very good equipped and clean . Excellent bathroom . Very quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a conference here and stayed on the 17th floor . I had a wonderful view , a very comfortable bed , a large bathroom , a huge living room and kitchen area . Everything was comfortable and the kitchen had everything I needed . I had a minor issue with the bathroom and management took care of it I ##MM ##ED ##IA ##TE ##L ##Y ( Thanks Manager Jason ) . Wonderful staff . I also very much enjoyed their breakfast and the evening snack ##s they offered ; those things means a lot when you ' re out and about all day long and don ' t have time to grab something ! The little grocery store was helpful too . I would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 3 nights with friends to celebrate a retirement . Hotel staff was very friendly and welcoming . Room was very nice though bathroom was small , which was not a surprise for an older , but fully re ##mo ##del ##ed , hotel . Free coffee and evening social were very n ##cie touches and we really liked the common area in the lobby area for relaxing or just chill ##ing . Location was close to theaters ( went to one play ) , restaurants , and many attractions including the Miracle Mile . We got a lot of steps in during our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is clean , our room was quiet . Lots of amenities but the best part is the location . Great walking neighborhood for getting to Mill ##ennial Park , Michigan Ave , the Art Institute , Navy Pier , and shopping . Restaurant ##s are p ##lent ##iful and the hotel has a small but price ##y market . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the Hilton chain , it ’ s all I stay at because of their excellent service . This hotel has the worst front desk staff , the manager was rude and very un - Hilton . The lobby is beautiful , but the rooms are dated , no coffee maker , old towels . I can get past all that , but a bad staff , ruins the experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in the perfect location for shopping . The staff was all very friendly and helpful . The rooms were very spacious . My daughter picked this hotel for my granddaughter ##s birthday . The American Girl package had many extra amenities which made her day extra special . It is a bit price ##y , but most of the good hotels on Michigan Ave are . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is just off Michigan Avenue . The streets are a little confusing on W ##ack ##er but once the car was parked we were able to walk almost every where so the location was great ! The room was clean . The beds were comfortable . It was quiet & relaxing to stay here even in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The stay was very comfortable , with great facilities . It was within good walking distance of the museums , and easy transportation distance of everything else . The staff was phenomena ##l and the historic setting was unique and beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here just after Christmas with my girlfriend at a special one - year anniversary rate . Very central location just off Michigan Ave . right in the middle of the Ma ##g Mile . Modern luxurious bout ##ique - is ##h hotel expert ##ly converted from an office building . Friendly and efficient staff . Excellent views from our comfortable corner room ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a huge hotel but with nice , large , clean rooms and good service . If you can get one of the river view rooms they are particularly nice ! There is also a large conference space and if you are attending an event , it ’ s obviously most convenient to stay on site . The only draw ##back is this hotel is quite expensive , not unlike most high end hotels in Chicago . The hotel is also within walking distance to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , lots of restaurants , the area south of the river , millennium park , and basically anywhere else you need to go . High ##ly recommended if it is within your budget . In other cities you could do better for the price , but not really Chicago if you need to be in this area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location can ' t be beat . Being so close to the best attractions in the Loop such as Grant Park , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and the river gives you access to countless things to do . I thought the room was very clean and comfortable and I would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##led first weekend after New Year ’ s with 3 18 year old girls . Check ##ed in and was assigned to an adjoining room . Hotel is grand but a little dated . Room ##s are large and bathroom ##s are spacious . Again just a little worn at the edges . When we checked in , the bathroom had been missed by the cleaning crew . Immediately reported it and was assigned to another floor . Great response from management . Very good location to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ; lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance . Breakfast restaurants in walking distance : Wild ##berry and Egg ##y ’ s . Both highly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came to Chicago for my wife ##s birthday and to sight see . This hotel was right by all the shopping and a quick cab / l ##y ##ft / u ##ber ride to all major destinations . For the price you can ##t beat this hotel . The only " issues " , if you want to call them that , are that the rooms are very small and the doors are extremely loud and heavy . Of course this should be expected for a hotel of this age . The loud doors did wake us up a few times during the night but again for the price and location you cannot beat this place . We will probably stay somewhere else next time but I would not mind staying here again . I would recommend it to family / friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Easy check in with friendly staff Well equipped room that is spacious . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary drinks at the lounge 5 - 8 pm Continental breakfast included Great location that is very central . Bottom line . High ##ly recommend . We will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing special done by hotel for my wife ' s b ##day , but nice place to stay and location is perfect . Staff was friendly but layout of hotel is a little di ##sor ##ient ##ing . Bell staff couldn ' t find my checked bag when I came back to pick it up - not lost , they just couldn ' t find it . I walked back and got it myself . [SEP]
1	[CLS] April 9th - 12th At ##tended a Conference . Disco ##vered I had left my Am ##ex Card behind and spoke to Angelina in Lost & Found and she was pleasant , professional and very helpful . I received my card in a couple of days and I am so app ##re ##cia ##tive of her assistance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really never was aware of this hotel . Great location and new modern rooms . We had business meetings and the staff was absolutely te ##rri ##fic . Food for two dinner ##s was solid and the service was great . My room was on the angle of the building . Hu ##ge bathroom with double sinks and large shower area . This was a very good surprise and a nice hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I arrived at the hotel for a business meeting that started at noon . I used the v ##alet for parking ( using spot hero to get a discount ) . No problems at all with that . Got to the front desk , and my room wasn ’ t ready ( it was 11 ##am , and check in is at 3 , so this wasn ’ t a surprise ) . The front desk was extremely helpful , held my bags and then called me when the room was ready . I was on the 29th floor , with a view of the city . Really great service , beautiful room , fantastic room amenities . High ##ly recommend So ##fit ##el . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel very clean and up to date ! From the v ##alet curb ##side , front desk , con ##cier ##ge and Yo ##land ##a in house ##keeping all provided friendly , genuine and helpful service . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located and wonderful views . Check out the underground walkway ##s to avoid in ##cle ##ment weather ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had great service from check - in to check - out . Man ##dan ##a in the gold lounge was particularly great and went above and beyond . Cody and am ##igo are always so welcoming and we ’ re great as well . The bacon was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Close to everything and really nice clean place ! Staff was friendly as well Breakfast was nice as well ! Free W ##if ##i and rooms are very nice ! There is gym and all good restaurants are close by ! Price was perfect too ! Would stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] On line check - in was new for me and useful . Walk right up to check ##in desk and key was available . I was able to check ##in @ noon Staff were friendly and always asking if they could help Occasionally noisy from traffic and sire ##ns . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After two years , I came back to Chicago for the American Academy of Op ##ht ##hal ##mology and stayed again in the Intercontinental Hotel , because it ’ s excellent and it ’ s in the best place of Michigan Avenue , near everything . This time I stayed for a week in the room 66 ##8 and I had a memorable experience . I want to thank you all the people of the hotel that helped me a lot , specially the Guest Ser ##iv ##ices Manager - Malcolm Moore for all ##l your attention . De ##fin ##ite ##ly I love this hotel and when I return to Chicago , that ’ s the place I will choose again . I have no doubt about it ! It was a great time and once again , thank you for everything ! High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second visit to the Kim ##pton . The hotel is bout ##ique and very nice . The staff is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful . Location is perfect , two blocks from Michigan a ##ve . The hotel has a couple of bikes you can borrow for the day , but get their early , they only have a few . Would highly recommend this location and hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed this hotel just off Millennium Mile . The room was clean and the staff was friendly . The hotel is literally steps from the Hancock building , Star ##bu ##cks , cheese ##cake factory , Wild ##berry , and The Drake . I would definitely stay there again and the price was right . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location and the staff was very helpful ! The rooms are well kept and s ##ty ##lish . They also have compliment ##ary drinks in the lounge and the guy who works there Josh was amazing . De ##fin ##ite ##ly staying here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is in an excellent location . Every time I have been here the staff has been friendly and welcoming . It is the only place we stay when coming to Chicago . The location couldn ' t be better . Close to restaurants , parks and the lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A hotel right in the middle of the Chicago loop . Excellent ##ly located , convenient ##ly accessible , average priced . Nothing negative to say but also nothing special or worth remembering . I was there , stayed the nights but can ' t really remember much . Maybe the ideal business hotel ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently held a reception for a UK university in the ' Current ##s ' room at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago and it was a lovely space for the relaxed event . The staff were all very helpful both in advance of the event ( Veronica ) and during the event ( G ##uad ##alo ##upe , Alex and others ) . Thanks very much . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice property in a great location . Unfortunately their reception desk at the time of my visit was terribly under ##sta ##ffed . No one was there for 15 minutes ! I noticed long lines for the rest of my stay . Also didn ' t feel the hotel had the best clean ##liness . I suspect they are having staff ##ing or employee relations issues . Maybe this is all over Chicago ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent service , room and very close to major attractions and restaurants . Looking forward to visiting again soon . Hotel clerk helped with printing boarding pass when hotel printer was not working . Having a market in the hotel was helpful for buying small food items . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a lovely stay for a weekend . Central ##ly located so you can walk to the Art Institute and Grant Park as well as to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile with its shops , restaurants , and even the Dr ##ie ##haus Museum . Bed ##s are super comfortable . Our room with 2 queen ##s was spacious . Staff are friendly and helpful . Con ##cier ##ge had great restaurant suggestions . We had an a ##c problem in our room that was fixed within hours . You can get free w ##if ##i if you sign up for Kim ##pton Ka ##rma reward program . A great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Palmer House is a beautiful hotel with a friendly staff and great location to shopping and other attractions in Chicago . Our room was huge and the hotel is clean and quiet . So many things are within walking distance including Michigan Ave . , Eat ##aly , and Millennium Park , home of the famous " Bean . " Both restaurants served good food ( better than average for a hotel ) but the service was a bit slow in both . The Sunday breakfast b ##uff ##et was very good . The only negative is that the bathroom in our room was very small with almost no space for toilet ##ries , etc . Easy enough to work around but a couple of shelves would have made life a bit easier . I will stay at Palmer House again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The con ##cier ##ge at the O ##m ##ni in Chicago was excellent . He arranged and secured disco ##une ##t ##d tickets for us at the " Architecture Tour " . He ' s very info ##m ##rative and was a plea ##us ##re to deal with . The lunch ##es at the conference I attended in the hot ##we ##l were well above average and the service staff were exceptional . I s ##l ##pet like a baby every night , but do su ##gg ##ets they replace the p ##ilo ##ws for the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed the weekend at the Hilton Chicago . Check in was a snap from door ##man , bell ##man , and especially Miss Alicia at check in . All special requests were delivered on . Could not have hoped for better service . We ’ ll be back soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel , the rooms are nice , modern and comfortable . The location is excellent and 1 block off Michigan a ##ve . The hotel lobby and restaurant are on the 20th floor which makes for a cool v ##ibe . The restaurant is v well rated and has a great v ##ibe on a Saturday afternoon and evening . For a drink or food its really very good . Nice city views and a huge TV in every room , lovely . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a lovely place to stay in Chicago ! People are so friendly and helpful here ! The place is beautifully de ##oc ##rated for the holiday as well ! Every no ##ok and c ##ran ##ny ! We were access ##able to everything we wanted to see ! The door ##man are spectacular ! B ##low that whistle and a cab appears ! Or walking distance to the pretty mi ##chi ##gan avenue ! A lovely time of year here . You can ##t go wrong staying here ! Bar and Food is also very good ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Good service . Con ##cier ##ge very helpful . Great to have the pool . Nice touches like compliment ##ary water in room each day . Breakfast superb . Some outside space and more of a lobby seating area would be nice . Would stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3 night stay at the end of a road trip . This hotel is in a great location , an easy walk to bars , shops and restaurants . Lake Michigan is an easy walk too . The hotel has a stunning reception , bar and restaurant area which is very busy on Friday & Saturdays . We enjoyed a couple of drinks in the bar during their happy hour . Our room was small with a low bed . It was functional but nothing special , all be ##ige and white . It had everything you need , just lacked the spark ##le . It was our first time in Chicago and it really is a stunning city to sights ##ee in with so many great bars and restaurants for the evenings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great . Lo ##bby is beautiful . The room we had was less than beautiful . Fu ##rn ##iture was very beaten up . Walls scratched . Fu ##rn ##iture was all mi ##sma ##tched . The rooms were definitely not the quality that the lobby would portray . It was clean . Was ##hr ##oom was clean and in good shape . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visited Chicago for a conference and made a reservation at Ambassador . First of all , the hotel is located in a wonderful neighborhood , very close to public transportation and restaurants and pubs . Yet , at the same time , it is quiet . Second ##ly , the staff was very helpful and friendly and professional . On the day I checked in , Mel ##ika welcomed me and assisted me . She was great ( as well as the other people at the con ##cier ##ge I interact ##ed with ) . She helped me get settled and answered all my many questions . The house ##keeping crew was exceptional . The room was imp ##eca ##ble . Overall , an excellent experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A week ’ s business in Chicago and a large group of us were booked into the Swiss ##ote ##l . The breakfast was a fairly standard American b ##uff ##et , but friendly and at ##ten ##tive staff ensured that nothing ever ran out . The room had a beautiful view of the lake ( and its ice ! ) and the bed was very comfortable . We also tried “ The Palm ” one evening , and full thanks to Lisa , our waitress , who looked after us with easy and generous warmth - and the food was really superb here , too . All in all a highly - recommended hotel and a credit to central Chicago - hope to return again soon . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This historic property is everything you expect from an Intercontinental Hotel . The team was quick with the Check - in and even found us a great room with a view of the Tribune and W ##rig ##ley buildings . Our suite was huge and in excellent condition and offered plenty of space to stretch out to work and relax very leisure ##ly . Luis at the bar in Michael Jordan ’ s was awesome and took great care of us late into the evening . I wish we could have stayed more than the one night and will be back again soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is good . To ##ns of shops and restaurants nearby . Room is spacious and clean . W ##if ##i is charged but it could be waved by requesting . King - size Bed is comfortable and we both slept well during staying . G ##ym and pool is a plus . What I dislike is wall is a little bit thin . Also , there ' s no electric k ##ett ##le in the room ( although there ' s a coffee machine ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , clean room , very comfortable beds and pillows ! My only suggesting is to bring your own adult beverage as they do not offer any alcoholic drinks on the room service menu ; restaurant / bar is closed due to Co ##vid . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The check in experience was not great even though the problem was solved . The prices are very high ( and I compare this to London prices ) . The handling fee for a package I sent to the hotel was a right shake ##down too . It overs ##had ##ows what they get right - great b ##uff ##et breakfast ( at a price of US $ 31 I ' d be outrage ##d if it wasn ' t amazing ) , V ##ER ##Y comfortable bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] H ##OR ##RI ##BL ##E customer service . You call and get different information every single time . Then someone hangs up on you . The " supervisor " only says " I apologize " but doesn ' t do a d @ m ##n thing to actually make it right . Too many other options in this neighborhood to bother with this disgusting ##ly run place . They don ’ t seem the least bit concerned about you or the fact that their staff has no idea what they ’ re telling people . “ Super ##visor ” Nancy was of no help and seemed bored to be on the phone . I work in customer service - you guys need to seriously get it together . ST ##A ##Y A ##WA ##Y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a long weekend trip . Good , central location . We walked almost everywhere . The lobby is decorated G ##ats ##by style so be sure to spend some time relaxing in it . Our room was on the tiny side . pillows and bath ##robe ##s were soft and f ##abulous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , super friendly helpful staff , clean room , toilet ##ries provided were really nice . Only disappointment ##s parking is a challenge and no pool / spa . Do recommend and definitely would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel in the gold coast area , I highly recommend to stay at this property . We got upgraded which was awesome ! We had breakfast and dinner and highly recommend the hotels restaurant . Friendly staff upon check in . Will be back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a wonderful discovery ! The Hotel Monaco has a friendly , professional staff ; clean , comfortable , inviting rooms ; and absolutely te ##rri ##fic location . We liked it so much that we are joining their rewards program because our grand ##child will be attending college in Chicago and we see many trips in our future . Thank you Hotel Monaco . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently spent three nights in this hotel . The room was very clean , quiet and comfortable . It is in a good location for shopping and restaurants . Staff was very friendly & helpful after a difficult journey . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the Conrad for two nights . The room was im ##ma ##culate , the staff was friendly and helpful and the amenities were incredible . The black ##out curtains were a nice feature . The location is perfect and just steps from the heart of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . I would definitely stay here again and would recommend the Conrad to family and friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Found my new best spot in Chicago . My normal hotel was booked so tried this one . Love ##d it . Co ##m ##fort ##able , Clean and trend ##y . Super ##b location . Free W ##if ##i was great . As us ##ua ##s ##l parking is crazy expensive but that ' s Chicago ; ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a fast friendly check - in . Though there was no mention of an upgrades or additional cost for breakfast , but the check - in process was good . The room was clean and nice and cool on what was a long hot day - Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ask for an upper floor when you arrive . There ’ s a lot of loud construction on the lower floors . Beautiful hotel , close to Michigan Ave . shopping . There ’ s a nice diner on the corner too . Staff was nice . I loved the ch ##amo ##mile tea at the front desk . Vale ##t parking is too expensive . No other complaints . I plan to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We get downtown a few times a year and this is now one of our favorites . The staff was very polite and professional . Re ##ceiving updated texts was also helpful . The location is f ##abulous too . Easy to walk around and enjoy the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I spent the weekend here . The staff was friendly and helpful . The location is right at the end of the mile . The rooms are a little small but that is to be expected given the age of the building . The bathroom ##s have been renovated . I love the rain shower shower ##s . The bed was comfortable . We will definitely consider this when visiting Chicago the next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I questioned being charged 2 resort fees in less than 24 hours . . . . I was told this was standard and everyone in Chicago does this . . . one I get but 2 different charges plus room , plus taxes really . . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great Hotel ! ! ! I enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Chicago ! Staff was great and the food was too ! I liked how clean the hotel was and even the j ##ani ##tor ##al staff made you feel so welcomed . I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is ok . Nothing special compared to other hotels in that area . I stay here already for 10 years since it is one of the pre ##ffer ##ed hotels of our company . The service is really going down here . You see also a lot of changes in staff which for me is not a good sign . Last time I stayed 4 nights and breakfast is suppose to be there at 6 : 30 ##am . None of the days it was on time . The earliest everything was there was at 7 : 15 ##am . Co ##mp ##lain ##ts did not help at all , same next day . Women that needed to take care of B ##F did not care at all what people said . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room very small . when I try to e ##pen the bathroom door it can only opened half way because the bed is so close to it . The room was not serviced two of the days and the room was very sting ##y on soap and towels . I paid $ 50 . 00 a day for parking and at one of the banquet ##s we had 12 chairs per table and the servers were bump ##ing in to us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel in the Loop area of Chicago and close to many attractions . The room was spacious and very clean . The hotel is huge and requires a staff complement to support that number of guests . We found that attention to details was lacking and responses to our requests were delayed . The elevators were not operating properly and guests became frustrated with the amount of time spent waiting that we would jump on any elevator up or down to just get in . Finally , there was no final bill under the door . Instead , we had to go to the check - out desk and had no time to review the bill ##ing errors since we wasted so much time waiting for the elevator and then had to proceed to the airport . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent a long weekend with my girlfriend here and we had the B ##ES ##T time ! We arrived late at night and the front desk was super kind and helpful . Marcus upgraded us to a suite and was incredibly a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Everyone else on the staff was very nice and they have a great hotel bar with a great piano player . This hotel is located ~ 1 mile from some of the main bars so it ' s great for both those who want to check out the night life but not to close for those who ' d rather avoid that scene . I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has a lot of character . The staff is friendly especially Craig ( the bell ##man ) . The service was pro ##mpt whenever we needed anything . I ' ve stayed at several hotels downtown and this one was one of the best ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I wanted to love this hotel as I have had good experience with Kim ##pton hotels . However , I was disappointed . I must comment on the exceptionally small size of the room and the teen ##y , tiny , un ##work ##able size of the bathroom . I had a single room with a king bed and , while comfortable , it was just really quite cramped . The closet was so narrow / small my clothes could not even hang normally but were at an angle so the door could close ! The bathroom was so tiny I literally could barely stand in it to put my makeup on as the toilet and sink crowded out space to stand . Also , no coffee in the room , which is just a b ##um ##mer when travelling . Not comfortable and I will not stay at the All ##egro again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in their City View King Deluxe room . Walk ##ed in the door and was greeted by the fantastic staff . After checking in and grabbing a premium snack , walked in to room which was very clean and views were awesome . We spent days eating , shopping and exploring . Li ##teral ##ly was able to walk everywhere desired due to great location . Hotel itself was clean , has a great staff , plenty of extra ##s to keep you and yours happy ( breakfast , Happy Hour , premium snack ##s , etc ) contemporary v ##ibe and just overall comfort ##ability made it a phenomena ##l stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago in July 2017 . Had requested a 1 ##pm local time check - in through SP ##G and that was not honored . When I arrived at the front desk the check in clerk thanked me for “ speaking English ” as most of the people she ’ d dealt with that day hadn ’ t . Interest ##ing comment . The room itself was fine . It was clean . The bathroom is small but the large shower was appreciated . Great location with quick access to both Michigan Ave . and the River ##walk by foot . Like ##d the designated U ##BE ##R pick - up right out front of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Public is an elegant , old world hotel in a great location . Co ##m ##fort ##able re ##mo ##del ##ed rooms . The P ##ump Room Restaurant is a Chicago longtime favorite . I enjoyed my stay and look forward to returning the next time in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was super at ##ten ##tive ! I had notified the front desk that we would arrive really early and they had a room waiting for us . The location was nice and easy to find . The beds were comfortable and the shower was amazing ! It was also nice to have the continental breakfast on every floor . I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and would stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in the middle of everything . The rooms are big , clean and comfortable . The breakfast and social gathering food was hot but very boring . Come early to the social gathering or risk drinking wine on a beer glass or vice - versa . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We made A quick trip to Chicago for a Cubs game . We stayed here because of its location . It was a good choice . Very close to the miracle mile as well as the park . The service is very professional and the rooms are well - kept . We upgraded for an additional $ 40 per night to a larger room and feel like it was worth it . Great view of the lake and park ( room 350 ##3 ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##s first : D ##O NO ##T PA ##R ##K in the garage the front desk tells you to park in . It is 55 bucks a day . There is a garage right around the corner for 15 bucks a day . No room service . No house ##keeping unless you request it . No extra toilet paper in room . Mini bar empty in room . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not the level of service I am used to from this brand . Pro ##s : Will the door ##man is amazing . Give that man a raise . Super friendly . He is saving the day for this place ! The pool is also really impressive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited Chicago frequently for many years , my experience at the Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco ranks as one of the best . The room was comfortable , clean , and was stock ##ed with the great Kim ##pton bath products . Every staff member I encountered ( v ##alet , front desk , room service , door ##man , etc ) was incredibly welcoming , friendly , and professional . The location is great ! We parked the car and walked wherever we needed to go . It is close to restaurants , shopping , theatre , the river , etc . A ##wes ##ome city views from the room as well . I highly recommend this hotel when staying in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the pleasure of staying at the kin ##zie hotel in Chicago on a recent business trip . I was having trouble finding delivery for dinner . I walked down to the front desk and met a wonderful young lady named Christian . Not only did she help me . She ordered it for me and delivered to my door . Christian went above and beyond and never lost her beautiful smile . While dealing with this technology challenged woman . This hotel also takes dogs and has a small dog walking area . It ' s very convenient . Thanks to everyone at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . I shall return . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an enjoyable trip and the hotel is central ##ly located just across the street from Eat ##aly and close to numerous restaurants . A short walk to the river to catch an architecture cruise and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for shopping . The lobby is tiny but you check in on another floor . It would be better if they had more elevators . The rooms were comfortable and large with a well stock ##ed kitchen . I ' d definitely Italy recommend it for business or leisure . We booked three rooms for parents , kids and grandparents and everyone was happy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Te ##id ##ra B . worked hard at the front desk to make everything perfect for our stay . It isn ' t easy , in a busy city , to find a desk clerk who is interested in making every detail perfect . While I was register ##ing , an upset guest interrupted us in a rude manner , and I was impressed with the professional ##ism and ta ##ck with which Te ##id ##ra handled the situation . The rooms are convenient ##ly furnished , and clean with well trained cleaning staff . The location is an easy walk to Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue . This has become my new favorite Chicago Hotel . The location of the She ##rato ##n offers one of the best views up the river , in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby of this hotel is incredible but I would visit it and not stay here ! The rooms are very small , the corridors noisy and no free W ##i ##F ##i ! This is a relatively expensive hotel with absolutely no benefit if you intend to be out all day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As with most Kim ##pton ##s , this hotel is a bit q ##ui ##rky but in a good way . It is an older building in a great location . . . right on the river with lots of bars , restaurants , and sites within walking distance . The de ##cor is nice , and the staff is excellent and always ready to help . The rooms were quiet ( we never heard any noise from either the street below or from other rooms ) , and you can easily get to the train to / from the airport . Jo ##in their loyalty program to get the free w ##if ##i . This hotel is a great choice in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My son picked the Palmer House based on its history and we were well pleased . In a lot of respects , it was like a museum for us to walk and read and see all the pictures and exhibits from the past ! Could we have found more comfortable pillows ? Sure , but that is not why we visited . The Palmer House ’ s location was also key . The Blue Line from the big airport dropped us less than a block away . Mill ##ennial Park and Willis Tower five blocks away plus G ##ior ##dan ##os near each location . Pizza heaven ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a long weekend with college age son and wife to take in a show and cover a few restaurants in Chicago . Hotel location is perfect for exploring most of the city on foot . One can cover most of the travel sites via foot from the hotel . Room ##s are adequate in size for two / moderately tight for three people . Room ##s are clean / work ##out facility is clean and has a sufficient number of card ##io machines for guests . Hotel has a nice drink hour in the evening for its guests . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary paper and coffee in the morning are a nice touch . Service is excellent ; all the staff was helpful and polite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A Five star hotel with a very good service and staff . They have a good view to the river or the lake , the rooms are big and also they have a good restaurant and bars but the price is higher than normal . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with my husband - good location and nice hotel but what makes the difference is the staff and general et ##hos . Nothing is too much trouble , you feel very welcome and the design details are f ##ab - from the her ##ring ##bone mosaic ##s in the bar to user comfortable bars ##to ##ols and beds . We were very impressed and would certainly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although we ' ve only stayed at The Talbot ##t twice , both stays have been very enjoyable . Love the location and te ##rri ##fic staff ! When staff member Ronnie made the reservation for our visit last week , he went " above and beyond " to be sure we had a great room at a great price in addition to offering extra tips that made our stay even better ! We will be returning to The Talbot ##t and are recommend ##ing it to all our friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] D ##wayne is the best ! Friendly and helpful . . . made us feel very welcome , helped with bags , finding our u ##ber cars or simply making us feel at home . I ’ d visit again just to get that kind of greeting every day : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you can get past the hotel bar hostess who is far too busy and important to be bothered with you and the generally poorly trained or slightly combat ##ive staff , you will meet a desk manager who seems to genuinely care and will exercise ta ##ct in working through problems . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was lucky enough to need to work in Chicago for a few days . My company booked this hotel for me , and what an absolute delight . I love the Conrad chain - com ##fy beds , great toilet ##ries in the bathroom , imp ##ec ##ca ##ble service . This one was no different . I had a couple of breakfast ##s here - massive ( American portion ) but worth it ! ! Great views . Fin ##gers crossed I return to Chicago and if so - I ’ ll be back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Such a gorgeous hotel , stayed for just one night to see Chicago . The room was AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! So comfortable and such amazing views ! ! ! The breakfast was delicious really cannot daily the hotel it was a pleasure to stay there ! ! ! High ##ly recommend ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bout ##ique hotel was beautiful , I loved the de ##cor from the lobby , to the hallway , to our river view room . My favorite was the window seat ! Ph ##yl ##ici ##a M ##c ##Leod was very pleasant and provided us assistance each day of our stay from check - in , directions , to check - out . The door ##men were so kind and helpful . I ' m a native Chicago ##an and would highly recommend and make this my hotel of choice going forward . See ya soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel All ##egro is not the newest hotel but remain one of the best in the wind ##y city for good reasons . In the center of the theater district and easy access to just about everywhere downtown . The room and bathroom aren ' t the biggest but I hope you are not spending all your time in hotel room . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here on business for 1 night . Love the de ##cor , the staff was excellent and the restaurant ( 20 ##e ) was fantastic . The bed was comfortable , I realized in the morning that it was actually a Murphy bed ! I didn ' t sleep too well , however , there is a lot of street noise . Normally I have no problem with it but the night I was there I was awakened by street noise at least 3 times . Check - in / check - out was easy and quick , the hotel is in a great location for walking almost anywhere you would want to go , also near the train . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel just off from Michigan A ##V . The room was clean and modern however it did feel a little stuff ##y at times . The staff were friendly and helpful however a t ##v charge was added to our bill despite barely using the t ##v let alone watching a film . The mini bar was expensive but that ' s to be expected in all hotels . It has a beautiful ball room if you get the chance to view it and has quiet an interesting history from the prohibition era . I would stay here again if I came back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t stay here . ! ! ! Room ##s are so tiny you can ' t even move around room without hitting something . Called con ##cier ##ge to make us reservation on evening dinner cruise . She couldn ' t hand me a re ##ceipt , no map , no contact info , no confirmation . I thought this very odd . She insisted " I do this all this time " . I didn ' t get a good feeling . We went to dock , to check in . They never heard of us . Just as expected . Luckily , they had room . Front desk personnel was rude , te ##rse , not nice . One tiny soap in room , two towels . Really ? ? ? ? So many hotels in Chicago , never stay here ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have had the opportunity to stay here a few times on business , but this stay was on vacation with the family . Like always , the staff from the front door to the club lounge was fantastic and took care of my family and I . We had a suite with an attached double room for the kids and it worked out great . Amazing views , spacious rooms . . . all making for a great time . We did order room service one night and it was quick and very good . I really can ' t find anything to pick at , overall was a great stay . Location is outstanding - short U ##ber to main locations or short / decent walks . Front door staff very patient with the somewhat clue ##less U ##ber drivers , but always very nice to my family . We will be back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a Hilton Lifetime Diamond I ' ve stayed at plenty of hotels and I ' ve stayed at the Palmer house at least once a year for decades . It is a beautiful Historic hotel Lo ##bby and is located in a great spot for exploring . I ' ve seen changes in the last few years on attitude from the staff here . Perhaps it ' s Hilton ' s direction but the staff here has become arrogant and un ##friend ##ly . The rooms for the business travel ##er are old and need up ##dating . In a single " Historic " room the bathroom doesn ' t have enough counter space to put one persons bathroom accessories . Just be aware . Maybe because it was completely booked the staff was over worked but . . . . . . Next year we ' ll try a different hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Chicago has style & awesome beds as well as in room fresh br ##ew ##ed Star ##bu ##cks coffee ! Every room has a spectacular view . I look forward to returning every year to experience its unique design & f ##abulous surroundings , especially the view of the river & Navy Pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] High ##ly recommend the breakfast , either in the restaurant or by room service . We put our order on the sheet and hung it on our door . Order was exact , hot , delicious and delivered right on time ! The de ##cor was also very inviting , and the lobby smelled like the spa ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one night . Company booked us here . Room clean and t ##idy which is always a plus . Nice happy hour from 5 - 8 . B ##k ##fs ##t b ##uff ##et included in rate but ate elsewhere for no other reason than the trip was planned that way . But the food looked good . Nice bout ##ique hotel . Only grip ##e is the h ##va ##c is noisy and rattled loudly . . . . Am ##bie ##n solved that problem . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just wanted to take the time to thank Michael Y , the bartender for making my friends and I feel so welcomed . We had just arrived and didn ’ t have a good interaction with the woman checking us in - but Michael was there to save the day with his warm smile , at ##ten ##tive ##ness , & intentional ##ity . He took care of us and was such a great host ! He also made me an AM ##A ##Z ##ING Bloody Mary . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Talbot ##t is located perfectly in Gold Coast area . We enjoyed our stay in a very comfortable room . Sleep was te ##rri ##fic . Be ##ware of funk ##y views ( brick walls , fire escape stairs , and stained window ) . El ##eva ##tors are slow and small and for that reason often crowded . We would return for the same price given excellent location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ing at Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro has been such a wonderful experience ! The customer service here is exceptional and the employees are especially nice to talk to . S ##hout out to Paige for making our stay worth ##while ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed on the recommendation of a friend who had been there and told us how convenient it was to the C ##IB ##C . We had tickets to Hamilton - the theater was literally less than a block away . It ’ s a gorgeous 1920 ’ s era hotel - that means it has charm and el ##egan ##ce of that age . If you expect or desire a more modern hotel , this isn ’ t for you . We loved the convenience and am ##bie ##nce . De ##fin ##ite ##ly order a drink one evening and enjoy the gorgeous lobby area . We did have to call for an extra towel ( if 2 people are booked for the room , it would seem to me it would be logical for two bath towels to be placed in the room ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conference and then stayed for the weekend . Great room and wonderful views of Chicago . As with all these central city hotels parking and room service are crazy expensive . However the location at the north end of Millennium Park is wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was very different in style than other Kim ##pton properties I ' ve stayed at . A very ' 20 ##s gangster ##ish theme , I suppose fitting both the historic nature of the property as well as Chicago itself . Very small room compared to what I ' ve had at other Kim ##pton ##s ( or other Chicago hotels ) , although t ##i was fine for one night . Small bathroom too ; that felt a little right . The gym was on the small side , and completely jammed by 6 ##am . That said , the usual fine Kim ##pton service . And , well sound ##proof ##ed windows and very dark shades led to a very good night of sleep . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were in Chicago for a long weekend visit . The staff and property could not have been better . They were extremely re ##sp ##ons ##ive to all of our needs and created a wonderful experience for my family and I . Great Job ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Usually , I am too lazy to write reviews but I must write one for this property and their super friendly , consider ##ate , and well - trained staff team . They are doing a superb job . Don ' t get me wrong , it is not luxury level experience like sit down or in - room check - in while the door ##man walks you from the entrance to your room , but it is the best in their class . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently stayed at the Monaco with my son to celebrate his 13th birthday . This being his first trip to Chicago he was very excited to explore the city . Upon checking in we were greeted by a very friendly front desk professional who inquired the reason for our visit . My son told her we were celebrating his birthday with a weekend in Chicago and a trip to Notre Dame for a football game . After a great afternoon of exploring , we returned t our room and were delighted to find a Happy Birthday gift for my son . Go ##ur ##met pop ##corn , drinks and a card . He was blown away . The room was great . The atmosphere was great . But it is the little things that make a place special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel lots of character , good position for sight seeing in Chicago . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms with all am ##eni ##tes , really loved the queen size bed . Would have liked the restaurant to be open in the evening , only bar food available . The staff were helpful and friendly in most of the hotel but found the bar staff were rude on our first day so did not use it again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Andy our bartender was the shining star of our weekend ! Made us feel welcome and made sure we had everything we needed . He is the reason I am writing this review . He looked for us when we walked in and made sure our large group was accommodate ##d . We felt like he was the face of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is so very central I had stayed there before so was familiar with the area . We had a lovely few days - the staff were friendly and helpful . There were 4 of us in the room so it was a little small but adequate . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel and experience at the hotel were phenomena ##l - as you would expect from a hotel with such precedence . However , the hidden g ##em is the Witness the Moments tour of the hotel . J ##ac ##inda was our guide and she did a f ##abulous job ! The tour facts were so inform ##ative and interesting . Lots of behind the scenes pictures and facto ##ids ! I would H ##IG ##HL ##Y recommend taking the tour if you visit Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable , friendly and helpful staff and great location ! The room is very spacious with a wonderful bed . Close to fancy restaurants and shopping . Great Experience ! Excellent hotel and I really tipped for any purpose in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ing for 2 weeks for business . Amazing hotel and staff . Gregory went above and beyond to make sure we felt at home everyday ! ! He made us feel very welcome , held great conversations and gave great tips for the city . Would definitely recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , bright , good service , and good diverse selection of breakfast items . Staff friendly and very helpful . Location excellent close to red line and Michigan Avenue ( magnificent mile ) . Also close to river cruise ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to take a stay ##cation since spring break was cancelled due to the Co ##vid - 19 shut in and chose the hotel as they had a pool so our girls could swim . Once we arrived we were treated amazing ##ly ! We booked a regular room and since the hotel was not busy during this time they upgraded us to a “ g ##yn ##orm ##ous ” suite ! ! We felt like royalty and it really made the loss of spring break less of a b ##um ##mer . The staff was wonderful ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Always reliable for a clean , comfortable , and great stay at a great Chicago location ! Pretty much our first choice of hotel for value and convenience to all amenities . We will be returning in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The price was very reasonable The check in and out was easy and fast . The hotel was very clean and the customer service all around is a 10 . I plan on returning and enjoying more of what the hotel has to offer during my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel . Very clean and well maintained . Modern rooms with finger ##tip electronic controls for lights , d ##rap ##es , etc . Excellent , efficient daily service . Front desk service excellent . Hotel very secure . Personnel at front door adequate but not abundant . Nice rooftop bar . Not impressed with restaurant breakfast but coffee shop on ground floor much better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Not far from the restaurants and action of the city . About 45 minutes from the airport ( with traffic ) . 30 minutes to the navy pier . Room ##s are very nice . No view . Ex ##pect ##ed for a big city . Bar is small . Bart ##ender ##s decent . Not crazy expensive . Would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Water was brown . In the pictures , there were table and chairs in rooms . No table in chairs in my room . Reserve ##d queen beds , the beds were not queen . Web ##site advertised online steaming with the TV . When I could not make this work , I called the front desk and they said the TV ' s do not do this . They said they would send " engineering " to help with the TV , engineering never came . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed spending time in downtown Chicago at the So ##fit ##el Hotel . Walking distance from the subway Red Line , Miracle Mile Shopping , great restaurants , and the John Hancock Tower ! We took the Orange Line from Midway Airport , so you don ’ t even need a car ! Great views from our room , S ##W ##EE ##T ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the v ##alet parking attendant to the check in attendant and employees in the lobby . . . everyone was extremely friendly and happy to help ! The room was nice and the river view was as advertised , but the real view would have to be the lake view ! Co ##m ##fort ##able bed and clean room were expected and delivered ! We came for a show at United Center and it was a quick and cheap ride to the event . En ##joy your stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was chosen because of its location , close to restaurants we wanted to eat at . A block off Michigan Ave shopping and 1 bedroom suites made the perfect hotel for us . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast was good except no pan ##cakes or wa ##ffles which disappointed my grandson . All the staff were wonderful and friendly This is the second time we ’ ve stayed there and would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was great and in a great location . The staff was friendly and helpful . The room was very nice , clean , and had a great view . I would definitely recommend this hotel . Overall we had a great time at the hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in a very nice neighborhood with tree - lined streets and great shopping . There are a p ##let ##hora of good restaurants to choose from . E ##20 , right at the hotel is a great place to eat , especially in the warm weather when you can sit outside . I was very disappointed in my 2nd floor room that looked onto a cement roof and 2 adjacent walls and an H ##VA ##C system giving the room zero light . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the absolute B ##ES ##T experience at the Ambassador Chicago . The hotel is located in the best area of the city , and has the best service . Travis Howard facilitated my booking , arranged for a special check in , and was there if I needed anything . He was so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful . He truly made our stay special and something to remember . The suite that we had was beautiful , clean , spacious , and so so so comfortable . I cannot wait to come back and stay at this hotel again . Travis , you ' ll be getting a call soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ing at the Ki ##nz ##ie for a quick weekend get ##away , check - in was a breeze . The rooms were just like I remembered , like new , comfortable beds and very clean . Located just north of the river , the bar district is right around the car , allowing us to bar hop the evening away and in five minutes you could be up the elevator heading to your room . I recommend the Ki ##nz ##ie to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed a two - night stay for a conference . Nothing to complain about and nothing to r ##ave about . I really liked the location - I had a view of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan from my room . Nice exit onto the river walk from the bottom level . The only meal I ate on ##site was at a banquet and the food exceeded my expectations . Easy to check - in and out . Right next to Navy Pier . And since I didn ' t have to pay ( company dim ##e ) , I have no idea if the value was worth it or not . Everything was as it should be in the room . Overall this review likely didn ' t help you - but hey good luck finding the right hotel in Chicago . Got plenty of options ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The check - in smooth and fl ##aw ##less , and service at the restaurant is excellent . The room is clean and well maintained . The hotel amenities are good . Very good location for restaurants and sights ##ee ##ing . I really enjoyed my business trip at this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , with great service . really nice room , but make sure to pick a room in higher floor , otherwise the ambulance and fire truck noise could be too much . This location is the perfect place for your first visit to Chicago , in the middle of everywhere ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 4 nights in August and had a lovely time . Top end of the magnificent mile so good location . Around the corner from a Ch ##eese ##cake Factory and all the shops . Hotel room de ##cor is a little tired and in need of modernization but the room is clean and the bed super com ##fy . All round a good stay for a big American city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had two booking ##s here . Once I was off my company stay they transitioned me over smoothly to allow us to stay in same room for the weekend . Hotel was Clean and quiet . Really con ##fort ##able bed and pillows ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our suite was very spacious ( with a place for E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING ! ! ! ) and beautiful , with a fantastic view of the city and Lake Michigan ! ! All of the staff were very friendly ; and the Gold Lounge breakfast and service were excellent ! ! ! Del ##ores & Patricia went so far as to br ##ew fresh ice ##d tea for my husband , and they even provided it to him in a pitcher for his own personal use ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] As I said before it ##´s been 6 years since I discovered the Public Hotel . So I am a usually client , for me is the best hotel in Chicago because you feel like home . I have been traveling to ch ##ica ##go for more than 10 years and I have been in the great ##es hotels like Peninsula , Duck , Intercontinental , Hi ##ya ##tt but definitely P ##U ##BL ##IC is my home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic hotel in a very convenient location . Walking distance to most of downtown . Beautiful view , especially the river view . Very comfortable rooms .

We really had nothing to complain about . Will visit again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It ’ s really a nice high end hotel . They really care about the guest ’ s comfort ##ability . They ’ re really good in a ##cco ##mo ##dating guests as well . I will re ##cco ##men ##d Intercontinental hotel to my friends whenever they visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the v ##alet to the front desk to the room to the breakfast , fast friendly helpful service . The hotel is still a g ##em , just so ornate . The location is excellent . Close to the park , theaters , restaurants , just a short hop to Michigan Ave . The whole experience was great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A lovely friendly hotel in a great location . The staff were really helpful . The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable . It was the ideal base for a holiday . As a single travel ##ler I felt safe even when returning to the hotel late at night . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is where you need to be in the City Centre and five steps from the shops and the mile - it does not come cheap but none do in this position - its new and the service is first class , as are the rooms - very large and comfortable - all new electric g ##ad ##gets control every aspect of you life from when you check in on the 20th floor till you reach your room - I have read mix reports but i have to say this is one of the nice ##st hotels i have stayed in in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff and the rooms are top notch ! Very professional and helpful to a person . Love ##d the f ##abulous a ##roma ##ther ##ap ##y scent ##ed linen ##s . The entire hotel has such a nice scent . Good energy v ##ibe . The gym was a nice plus , as was the compliment ##ary coffee and tea . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in Chicago for the week due to work presentations for a new client as well as making my rounds w / other clients . The I ##H ##G Chicago was incredible . They upgraded me to a super comfortable suite and made my whole work week very pleasant and smooth . The staff was very pleasant and helpful w / anything i needed ( e ##g getting around town , sending out Fed ##E ##x packages , etc . ) . In addition , the location to shopping and food is also a huge plus . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Was an amazing experience staying at the O ##m ##ni Hotel for three nights . Staff was pleasant , room exceeded my expectations and the cleaning service was spot on . Breakfast was on point . I also like the location and convenience the hotel offers . It ' s within proximity of all the places you want to visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was very nicely red ##one . Service was not good . Room service was horrible . Vale ##t had you use a # to call for car , but it didn ' t work . We had 3 people in a junior suite at check in , yet had to request a sofa pull out linen service at 10 ##pm . They have a long way to go . . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were shocked that we either had to pay $ 9 . 95 P ##ER D ##A ##Y or join their loyalty program to get free w ##wi - f ##fi . We did neither considering we could just go to star ##bu ##cks ! The rooms are very beautiful and the beds are fan ##tas ##it ##c ! With black out shades def ##inate ##ly can sleep in ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The All ##egro is located right in the theatre district of Chicago . The room was small for paying a city price . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The door ##men were court ##eous and helpful . If your looking for a place to hang your hat and hit the city it ' s fine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , good rooms with two serious problems : 1 ) elevator waits are always long . They have two and need four . 2 ) the air ##con ##dition ##er blast ##s art ##ic winds directly onto the bed . The kitchen is great if you fix meals for kids , and to store left ##overs . The room layout a bit small with two rooms and two TV ##s . My wife loved it because of the kitchen , I was not happy with the blast ##ing A / C , but we ' ll stay there again . Very , very good value for a great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this property several times over the past 18 years . This year the prices for rooms were very reasonable . The atmosphere in the bar was excellent and food was very good . Door ##men were excellent . The rooms used to be very ups ##cale . I would call the new renovations generic . I could have been in any hotel . The King suite we were in was room ##y . We were able to have friends in for cards . There was no mirror in the room except for the bathroom . Wine glasses were a plus . Room was clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved about an hour or so before check in & I felt as if we were forced into an upgrade otherwise we ’ d get a room with full beds ( even though I was booked a king ) I also felt like I was de ##ceived by the upgrade I was told we ’ d be up ##grading to face navy pier however we were not So we had to room change . But when we arrived to the new room it was dirty . Bath ##room was not cleaned and previous guest had left things behind . Which made me question the clean ##liness of the whole room . Also I was not told of urban fee or what was included so did not get to utilize any of the inclusion ##s with it . When I Contact ##ed the property w my concerns and I was told I ’ d be receiving a call back however I never received a call back . 100 % disappointing . would not recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are a bit small , but other than that , it ' s a first class hotel . Nice little bar in the lobby , clean rooms , nice bathroom . Just off of Michigan a ##ve . what more could you ask for ? Vale ##t parking , plus other parking options around the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly staff . Great location in the middle of downtown , steps away from Michigan Avenue . Room ##s are divided into separate sleeping and living areas ; with the living area offering a pull out couch . Lots of room for larger groups [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with our kids for a downtown get ##away . Staff was excellent all around . Con ##nect ##ed rooms were perfect . Bar at night was active , drinks were great and the breakfast in the morning was amazing . We will definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Random ##ly selected this hotel from a list that included swimming pools . The pool far exceeded the pictures on the site . Full size Olympic style , 4 ft shallow end to 10 ft on the deep end . S ##wi ##m lanes for serious swimmers and open space for families . Work ##out room had everything you needed for card ##io and weight training . The best part of this place was the staff and their willingness to keep you satisfied . Ke ##enan the bell hop went above and beyond to turn my weekend get ##away to an amazing family vacation I ' ll never forget . Special thanks to you and hope to stay there again soon ! [SEP]

[SEP]
1	[CLS] I really loved the location . Close to Rush street and Michigan Ave . The room was very clean and modern . Bed was probably the best hotel bed I have slept in . I had a room on the 12th floor and was right next to the elevators and ice machine and no view . I booked through price line , so that was probably why I got that room , but I didn ' t mind because it was beautiful . Service was excellent . Staff were very nice and at ##ten ##tive . The lighting effects in the hotel and the room are cool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . We love staying here and being well serviced by the hotel and restaurant staff . It ’ s got a great location for shopping and most everywhere you would want to eat is just a short ride away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able room . Our room had two beds and two bathroom ##s . Very clean . The staff was very helpful and efficient . Nice television screen . Nice refrigerator . Easy check in and check out . Good wake up call . I hope the strike has been settled to everyone ' s benefit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place was amazing and perfect for kids . Had a g ##inger ##bre ##ad making contest on the weekend , and we loved our view .

1	[CLS] We flew out to Chicago for my best friend ’ s wedding which was to be held on ##site . The hotel upgraded our reservations because the room style we had booked was sold out . End ##ed up with a view of both the lake and river . Room was very clean and modern . The hotel is central ##ly located in the heart of Chicago ’ s magnificent mile with no shortage of shops , restaurants and beautiful architecture within walking distance . The re ##nai ##ssa ##nce ballroom where the wedding was held was just gorgeous with wood in ##lay , gold appointments and painted ceilings . The food was great too . Overall a fantastic stay and experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a historic hotel , I believe build in the 1870s . It retains much of the g ##lamour and op ##ule ##nce of hotels of that period ( at least from what you see in movies ) . The location is excellent ; close to many L metro lines ( Orange , Blue , Red ) . Right in the heart of shopping and theater district . My only complaint is that there was a ' m ##usk ##y ' odor in my room , perhaps the carpet . Otherwise , though , a beautiful and convenient place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a spectacular stay - because of staff . L ##yne ##tte , who checked us in and made sure our view was great because it was my birthday ; Alfred , who was simply an all - around good guy taking care of us ; and Amanda who thread ##ed a needle when we could not ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Caesar ##ea was wonderful in helping me solve a problem . Great front desk staff ! ! ! Bad - Chicago Hilton does not recognize your elite status with Hilton if you are an airline employee . They also do not have a con ##cier ##ge or hospitality room for Hilton elite members . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a week over New Years and found the location to be perfect . 5 min from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and 10 min from the activities on State Street . Easy 15 min walk to Navy Pier . To ##ns of good restaurants around the corner . Room ##s are great and we all had city views . Continental breakfast in the morning and cocktail ##s in the evening - all included in the room rate . We will definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The beds and pillows were horrible i " m still dealing with a back issue 5 days after it happen ##d . The a ##c can bar ##ley keep the room cool and there is no fan in the bathroom ##s . for the price of a 4 - star hotel i was pretty disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic natural and artistic displays . Un ##ique and fun reflections from the “ Bean ” . Great family outdoor site with water areas that are both art ##ful and playful . We enjoyed an unexpected afternoon performance of T ##cha ##iko ##vsky . Then walked across the street to one of the many great places to eat . [SEP]

1	[CLS] This was my first stay at this hotel . We have been wanting to book a stay for a while and finally did . It is in a great location if you are in Chicago to do some shopping - easy to access a taxi , U ##ber , or walk to restaurants , retail , or other venues . The room was a ta ##d small but comfortable . It was quiet but could be because I was on the 19th floor . The bed was comfortable as well . The work ##out space and pool are amazing . I look forward to my next weekend stay in Chicago . I will be staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean it ' s just so expensive . . but I guess that ##s the big city ! We liked the rooms a lot , very unique layout . Our view wasn ' t great , but we didn ' t upgrade either . The conference center was fantastic ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location , helpful friendly staff , clean , quiet rooms , great view from charming window seats , nice art work , yoga mat , provided me with a k ##ett ##le upon request . This is my hotel of choice for Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We flew into O ' Hare at the end of last month and needed a one night stop ##over before Amtrak - ing to Memphis . Hotel Monaco was a great choice ! Con ##ven ##ient ##ly placed just off the North East corner of The Loop , it has some great features - free hosted wine tasting every evening ( and you meet some interesting people ) , rooms with a padded window seat so you can watch the world go by , free tea , coffee and ice ##d water in the foyer and freak ##y animal print dressing gown ##s ! W ##if ##i is free if you sign up to the hotel group ' s ' club ' . Staff are lovely , and the attached restaurant is also excellent ( South Water Kitchen I think ? ) . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommended ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Palmer House primarily because of its location ( 1 block from Hamilton and 2 from Michigan Ave . ) and it was a great value . Our room was an upgrade and was spacious and very comfortable . I know that some of the rooms are quite small , but that is something we don ' t care about . The lobby , bar and public areas are stunning , you feel p ##amp ##ered from the moment you walk in the lobby . The staff is very at ##ten ##tive , we had noisy neighbors and after we called , security was up quickly and took care of it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got a great last minute rate for a beautiful large room , with two beds and an incredible view of Navy pier and the lake . Staff was wonderful , especially Victoria who helped to check us in . We were slightly disappointed that the pool was removed , but it has been replaced with a beautiful fitness center . High ##ly recommend this very solid hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] honestly speaking i don ##t like it as in terms of facility they don ##t have much arrangement . there ' s no compliment ##ary w ##if ##i , parking , water , laundry , gym etc . everything is paid and its quite expensive . even the water bottles kept in room are 8 dollars each which should be free at ##lea ##st . there ' s no microwave in the hotel and they charge 35 dollars for a very small out ##dated app ##liance which has very short wire . i have to keep it down to operate which is very uncomfortable . but views are great from room and rooms were clean and comfortable and comes with very large L ##CD TV . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly staff , appears clean , need some improvements on mattress ##es on pull out couch ##es and their pillows are very flat . Breakfast is awesome , dinner they offer is more of a snack we felt . Go out to eat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very well located to visit the city . Room ##s are big and com ##fy , with great views that can easily be enjoyed seated by the window . Dec ##oration is charming and the people working there very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Do ##y was excellent today ! ! He immediately came over and asked us what our needs were and if there was any way that he could help . He was very kind and patient with us and was able to book us an amazing deal . Thanks Do ##y , keep up the great work ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed there during the hotel strike and even with making allowance ##s for that problem , the hotel was disappointing . The room was not clean - left over pizza in a large box , c ##rum ##bs on the floor , not sure about the bed ##ding . Had a very un ##sat ##is ##fa ##ctor ##y conversation with the manager about the clean ##liness , though service people were sent who spray ##ed the room and bed ##ding with F ##ab ##rez ##e . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A unique and really pleasant hotel experience . Great staff experience from the curb at arrival to the curb at departure . Di ##st ##in ##ctive interior design and very clean and well appointed rooms . Beautiful restaurant and bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was expecting they have free breakfast ( at least ! ) . . . . for an expensive hotel . The location was great since it is along the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The room was great , very neat and co ##zy ! But the v ##alet parking is very expensive ! You might want to check out some v ##alet parking just a block away and save at least 50 % of the parking fee from the hotel itself ! And oh . . . . you will take T ##W ##O elevators before you reach your room . First elevator takes you to the front desk located on the 3rd floor . Then you will hop on to another one to connect to all floors . Weird right ? Almost all hotel guests I met and saw there had the same reaction when we get to the elevators . . . . . h ##mm ##mm ##m . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was pleased with the value for this hotel . great location , very professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Got the package with included v ##alet parking . . . that was a plus with in and out privileges . Kids got a welcome treat bag . Pool is nice , nice hot tub as well . Stay ##ed in corner suite . Would have liked an empty mini fridge to put some snack ##s and drinks into versus the stock ##ed mini - bar . Breakfast not included at this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ing to Wisconsin and we had one day to spend in Chicago . A very cold night and day in the city so we tried to plan carefully where to stay as to get close to the places we wanted to visit . This hotel was a perfect location to the 360 Chicago , wonderful shopping adventures , great pizza and other dining options and a general overall feel of the city . Staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We found the price for v ##alet parking to be very worth ##while for time and convenience . A great visit . . . wish we could have stayed longer ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ed with a group to celebrate a birthday and everything from beginning to end was amazing . Great location , great room , great view , great price and the best service also the bed itself is so comfortable I got the best sleep . S ##hout ##out to Hugo who really made our trip with his energy and amazing drinks at the bar . 2 more planned trips to Chicago before the end of the year and both will be at Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel . The staff are very pleasant and helpful . The hire is in an older refurbished building so the rooms are quiet with high ceilings . The beds are very comfortable with expensive linen ##s . Bath ##rooms are clean , modern and spacious . My only complaint about this hotel is that they don ' t have room service . But it won ' t stop me from returning ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just back from 3 nights at this perfectly located hotel in Chicago ! It was reasonably priced , with a great hotel breakfast available each day and decent rooms . Other big advantages are the incredible shops and so many great places to eat nearby ( Band ##era Restaurant is an absolute must ! ) . We were most impressed with the service we received from the Con ##cier ##ge , namely Douglas and Sylvia . From our first encounter when we asked about the Hop On Hop Off Bus ( which is an absolute must for any first - time ##rs to Chicago ) , to providing perfect directions to W ##rig ##ley Field and making our dinner reservations , they were f ##abulous . I know the role of Con ##cier ##ge is to do those very things , but as well - travelled guests we have rarely felt as warmly welcome as we did at the Intercontinental ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location for exploring downtown Chicago . It is within walking distance to shopping and g ##r ##wat eat ##eries . The staff was fantastic . The hotel was very well kept ; Historical yet modern room amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an amazing experience staying at this hotel for our daughter ' s 2nd birthday ! They treated her like a true princess ! They gave her a huge piece of chocolate cake with straw ##berries and written in chocolate was Happy Birthday ! They also wrote a card and slid it under the door for her . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed our stay here . The staff is a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and pleasant . The rooms are well appointed and comfortable . The sheets , pillows are l ##uxe . We didn ' t even have to share an elevator ride . I was impressed with our stay . Didn ' t have to sign in to the w ##if ##i each day of our stay . It was the little things at the Conrad that made for a memorable visit in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very surprised to learn we did not have a working shower . There was no water pressure . It came out in d ##rip ##s . Had to run to the spa to take a shower . Very di ##ssa ##tisfied with Fair ##mont ' s response to our complaint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located in downtown . Great place to stay . Room ##s are nice , big . I had a river view room and it looked fantastic . Am ##eni ##ties were as per the standard . Con ##cier ##ge service was fantastic and helped me booking and great advice as well . Check in and out was smooth [SEP]
1	[CLS] I want to recognize Rosemary in House ##keeping for her exceptional service and amazing positive attitude . She ’ s an exceptional employee and a wonderful example of outstanding customer service . Italian Girl ##80 [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , family friendly and super clean rooms . I enjoyed staying here , I was able to walk or ride the bus to all the places I wanted to see . The view from the breakfast area is great , I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this hotel recently and paid extra to stay at the Fair ##mont thinking it would be luxury - but we were unfortunately left disappointed . Upon arrival we had to wait in a que ##ue for 15 minutes to check in , even though we were second in line . The rooms were large but very dated . Pain ##t was coming off of the wall and the bed frame was extremely worn down with the f ##aux leather p ##eel ##ing off . If the hotels high price wasn ' t enough , they then try and squeeze every penny out of you for things which I believe should be free - W ##i ##F ##i , Tea & Coffee etc . All in all I do not feel this hotel is good value for money at all , I definitely wouldn ' t recommend staying here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at the Talbot ##t Hotel this weekend to celebrate my husband ' s Birthday . When we checked in , they upgraded us to a Jr . Suite since we were there for a celebration which we really appreciated ! It ' s in a great location and in walking distance to many fun landmarks and activities . The staff were very sweet and we definitely enjoyed our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent experience with front desk at upon arrival and departure . Quality of food in restaurants exceeded expectations in spite of being extremely busy one evening . Work out area was great - very large with many choices of equipment . Room was nice , too , albeit needs some minor bathroom renovations / updates . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed our one night stay , the room was clean and well appointed , the bed was very comfortable , and the environment quiet . Upon check ##out we were informed that there would be a $ 14 . 09 Hotel Service Fe ##e which is meant to cover costs of wireless and the health club access - neither of which we used . Staff refused to remove the charge from our bill , stating " everyone is charged the fee " . If that ' s the case , it should be rolled into the room rate , and not a surprise " got ##cha " at check ##out . Some may say " It ' s the industry standard " but that doesn ' t make it right . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . In the theater district , close to everything . Walk ##ed to all the sites . Bed was very comfortable , staff was excellent . Only negative was room was a bit noisy - heard hall and adjoining room noises . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great just don ' t eat ##T ##he View was great the facility was very modern Al of the restaurants is offered downstairs they looked a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting hotel kitchen was a joke this is probably the single most horrible experience with a hotel kitchen in over a hundred stays at hotels around the world . . Been to other Countries and wasn ' t so di ##ssa ##tisfied with a late meal [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every ##day was wonderful while staying here . It ' s so con ##vie ##nent to every tour we went on . They provided a free full , hot , delicious breakfast every day ! Social hour is at night M - T ##h and enough food is provided , that we did not go out to get dinner afterwards . All of the staff were 100 % friendly and helpful to us everyday . I absolutely recommend this Home ##wood Suite ##s for anyone . They arranged several tours for us & every staff member we encountered , had a smile ! We would def ##inate ##ly stay here again ! Debbie & Karl Weber Ph ##x , A ##z [SEP]
1	[CLS] An incredible gym and great location . Solid price and staff are awesome . The rooms are a bit old , poor early check in flexibility and terrible ( I mean horrible ) views from room . All I saw were other hotel guests in their rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited the So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile Hotel in late November and found it to be an excellent stay in Chicago . We rode the " L " from Midway and walked only two blocks from the train . Check in was fast and efficient and the staff was ve ##y helpful . Our room way modern and comfortable with good views to the east . We only stayed the one night , but the location was very good as we were near the train for the ride to O ' ha ##re for our flight out of Chicago the next day . Excellent hotel in downtown Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was superb . The view not that good . . $ 19 O ##ME ##LE ##TT ##E over excess . Heat in room set at 66 in - 10 weather but room still too warm . Other Ma ##g Mile hotels w more am ##bian ##ce . En ##joy ##able but closer to a 4 star or 3 plus . Knowing the area we would do this hotel again but not at the expense of other nice hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great staff , great spacious rooms and v ##ibe throughout the hotel . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a modern ch ##ic place that is leg ##it . The location is great too as you can walk to so many places so easily . Will stay here again for sure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My fi ##ance and I frequently book rooms and stay downtown to relax and get ##away from our lives in the suburbs . Our mini vacation ##s only last a weekend because usually that is all we need . We always choose a different Hotel every time so we can experience something different each time , but I must admit we will most likely returning to the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for our next get ##away and we will be staying longer than usual as well . The hotel ' s location is und ##enia ##bly perfect , the rooms are amazing , and service was great ! I have absolutely no complaints thanks to K ##wa ##me at the front desk making sure we were comfortable and pleased with our stay . It frustrated me to check out early because I did not want to leave . : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] How can a She ##rato ##n in downtown Chicago not have updated rooms with electrical outlets in the 2nd decade of the 21st century ? No good dining options in massive hotel . Dr ##ink ##s at $ 20 are a rip ##off - especially when one considers that they use cheap ##est wine on the market , i . e . an entire bottle is less than $ 10 . Ex ##cess ##ive mark ##up by the glass . No wonder I was able to get a heavily discount room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ` ve stayed at The Palmer House many times . I did appreciate the upgrade to a King room . Usually I have a good experience at this hotel . I did not like that I had paid for a Stay and Park package only to see that I was charged $ 85 for parking . Had I not caught this I would have been stuck . I asked before arriving if I should just pull up to Vale ##t in front of hotel . They said yes . Upon arriving I confirmed with v ##alet it was stay and park . They acknowledged it was . So strange that I was really supposed to self park across the street for this package after all . Also I don ##t like people asking for tips ahead of time . Ba ##g drop did that . I also did not like Hilton Grand V ##aca ##tions chasing me to the elevator to throw sales pitch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay with access to a lot of different places in the city ! Close to the office , close to dining and if you want to do some shopping , you will have no problem with this location . You can even enjoy a musical just steps away from the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If your going to Chicago this is a really great option ! The location is great , especially if you want to enjoy Chicago ' s night ##life . Its also great to just walk anywhere in the city . The lobby and restaurant are located on the 20th floor which makes for a great dining experience enjoying Chicago ' s amazing sky ##line . Room ##s are absolutely wonderful and the service is absolutely wonderful . One thing to note , they do not have TV ' s in any public areas , so if your planning on watching a sporting event , walk to one of the many nearby sports bars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel with great views from the room . We ##l ##coming an ##ne ##mit ##ies are really good . Restaurant ##s were very nice . Din ##e in services was perfect . Thanks for the bartender making my favorite drink in his own style . Will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the So ##fit ##el in Chicago for the Mid ##win ##ter Den ##tist ##s Meeting for the second year in a row and once again we were very pleased with the great location , beautiful hotel and the excellent service provided by their staff specially Mr . Gabriel Martinez at the front desk who went out of his way to make sure our stay was extra special . With imp ##ec ##ca ##ble professional ##ism he provided us with excellent , caring customer service . Thank you Mr Martinez we hope to see you again next year ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Walls were paper thin and could hear neighbors TV at night , the water f ##au ##ce ##t in the sink was loose and not secured / moving around , the K ##leen ##ex box ran out , and the bathroom is super tiny with no room for putting my toilet ##ries . Staff was good but the quality of rooms need a major upgrade . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was clean and had a lot of charm . The bell ##men were always there to open the door and assist with luggage and I loved the q ##ua ##int restaurant and lobby areas . The room was very well maintained as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for me . Room ##s are great , robes in the room a plus , breakfast bar on EA ##CH floor huge bonus . Downs ##ide , is stayed here twice , both times my k ##eri ##g coffee in the room hasn ' t worked , first time took 2 days to replace , this time I didn ' t even bother to get out changed out , coffee is just down the hall . Room service is from Harry Cara ##y ' s , who could ask for more ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location right on Michigan Ave . I ' ve stayed at the Intercontinental in Chicago many weeks at a time over the last ten years . The hotel is very nice but not te ##rri ##fic . Service is good but not great . Price depends on the season . You must however swim in the historic lap pool which in my opinion is the best feature of this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago is a great hotel . Walking distance to many retail establishments and the Lake . Love that they serve Star ##bu ##cks coffee in their coffee shop and their jewelry always gets me . Check in / out staff and wait staff are always a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago is a quiet o ##asis just off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The rooms are decorated in the sleek modern style that Conrad lovers admire and the bathroom ##s are well appointed . It would be nice , though , if Conrad had provided an executive lounge and if the regular bathroom ##s had been outfit ##ted with tub ##s in addition to shower ##s . Given the cost of real estate at this location , however , it was not destined to be . Still , all in all , this is one of the best places to stay in the Loop / Near North area . The hotel has a wonderful staff , who are well trained and respond to any request . And there is a full complement of eating and drinking choices . The views from the 20th floor restaurants are spectacular . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent three nights here and had a fantastic experience . I arrived after 27 hours of travelling and the service at reception was excellent - respect ##ful , helpful , and personal . Of course the location is a big plus , but equally the facilities are first - class . Room ##s are nice and in good condition , and the bathroom was modern and clean , so I felt comfortable from the moment I arrived . The food on site is good , and the fitness centre better than other comparable hotels I have stayed at . I very much enjoyed my visit to Chicago and the So ##fit ##el played a big part in that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A quick get ##away for sights and dinner Starting with the warm and engaging reception ##ist followed by the helpful Con ##cier ##ge whose directions were spot - on to the efficient room service personnel ending with the friendly door ##man - handy with an umbrella - the ST ##AF ##F at Chicago So ##fit ##el elevated my stay to the top . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were there for a vacation and I was running the Chicago Marathon . This hotel did an exceptional job . It was close to the start and finish line . We were within walking distance of many of the sights we were planning on seeing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice place to stay in Chicago ! ! Staff is wonderful , rooms are quiet and clean , nice breakfast . Perfect to visit Chicago . I came to run the Chicago Marathon and they make my stay perfect regarding my needs : breakfast earlier and free , bottle and snack for the race in my room , shuttle to drive us at the start , special meal for runner at the restaurant ! ! They know how to take care of you ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The best location and the price worth it cause you are one step away from the main attractions . Is a nice hotel and you could walk to restaurants and even to the cloud gate or the mi ##chi ##gan lake to take the boat tour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a nice place to stay ! We are a family of five with three active boys . . . it was perfect ! The pool was nice and pretty warm , but breakfast was good and the staff was very pleasant . The v ##alet stand was also a great wealth of information and very well staffed . They were very at ##ten ##tive and super friendly as well ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency is located right on the river ##walk with easy access to everything . It is only a block or two to Michigan Ave . and two blocks to Millennium Park . The boat tours launch right across the bridge . It was the perfect spot for our summer stay . We took the train from the airport to downtown and it was not a bad walk at all from the stop to the hotel with our luggage . We had a room in the West Tower and it had a spectacular view of the river , Navy Pier , and all the way out to the lake . This is a very large H ##ya ##tt property with lots of guests and events going on , but all the staff take the time to make you feel welcome . We experienced great service and the room was very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had the opportunity to stay here over the weekend . We had our company holiday party at the She ##dd and brought a small party back to the hotel bar for more drinks . The staff was incredible throughout the whole night and made me and my co - workers feel welcome even when we in ##unda ##ted the bar around 10 : 30 ##pm with lots of people . Beautiful views of Michigan Avenue , comfortable rooms and quiet floors . Can ' t wait to come back and stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a beautiful hotel . I opted to get the room with 2 bathroom ##s since we were staying for several day ’ s and there were four of us . So glad I did . The bathroom ##s are small . The room was a great size . Bed ##s were comfortable . The main room is breathe taking . Super convenient to the train , the theater to see Hamilton and Millennium Park . If you ’ re tall make sure you watch your head for the exit signs in the hallway ##s . It was a great stay and we would return if in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here and paid for the gold upgrade . Half of the things they said were available as part of that were not . I asked for a half an hour extension on check out to be able to administer a re ##f ##rig ##erated medication before leaving and they couldn ' t even fl ##ex enough to do that , instead reading a script about how busy they were with all the new people checking in . It ' s one of the worst Fair ##mont ##s I have ever stayed at . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Such an excellent hotel ! ! ! It ' s in a perfect location downtown ! We had great service from all the staff ! They were all super friendly ! Would definitely recommend staying here ! ! ! Thank you for the stay Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel ! ! We will be back soon ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything one can imagine as far as service this place covers w / class , stayed this stay w / Frankie Beverly & Ma ##ze and O ##J ##ays , had a performance at the U ##IC Pa ##vil ##lion Sa ##t ni ##te , and decided to stay over because of ice and snow [SEP]
1	[CLS] Long Time Diamond Member with Hilton , requested a late check ##out for 3 extra hours and was told flat no . I asked if 3 hours was worth the potential loss of a Diamond Member and was told that the 3 additional hours to a 4 ##pm check ##out was not something that they could do . Front office manager who would not listen to any issues and totally dismissed the request . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is really beautiful and in a wonderful location ! You ' re just a few blocks from Michigan Avenue and near so many restaurants that are within walking distance . The room was clean and lovely . The bathroom was great and big , like I prefer . I took part in one of the happy hours that they host on the 6th floor . Not the best wine , but it was free and there were snack ##s . I found people staying at the hotel as well that I could chat with , as I was traveling alone . I should warn travelers , please note that there are service fees that you will automatically be charged at check ##out . $ 24 . 95 and tax per night of your stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is amazing . Not just for its history but because of everything that it offers , to it ’ s clean ##liness , attention to detail and their staff . If you ’ re ever in the Chicago area you must stay at the Hilton on Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference ( not at the hotel ) . It was my first stay at a Conrad and I don ' t plan to make it my last . Everything was superb - - accommodation ##s , food , service . . . It felt like a mini - retreat . I was sick during my stay , and the staff was especially at ##ten ##tive to help me be as comfortable as possible without doing [SEP]
1	[CLS] I prefer this hotel due to customer service , location and the most comfortable beds ever . I extended my business trip into a family trip and my family was just as pleased with the hotel location and comfort ##s as I was . It ' s within walking distance of everything . A + + + [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a company event and was very impressed with the quality of the rooms - high end , beautifully designed and exceptionally well maintained . Design and quality of fit - out more 5 * than 4 . Sep ##arate shower and bath ##tub although hard to fill bath ##tub due to fault ##y plug . Room ##s well ins ##ulated so easy to get a great sleep . Electric blind ##s . In a great part of Chicago with easy access to Ma ##g mile and Gold Coast . St ##rik ##ingly designed hotel from the outside . Only negative - reception staff a ##bit frost ##y - guess trying to replica ##te the Parisian feel ! ! Dec ##ent bar although not big - didn ' t check out gym Would I stay here again - Absolutely [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful suites and located within walking distance of everywhere you want to go . Coffee delivered to the room each morning with the paper ! I feel like an honored guest . Beautiful city s ##cape views . ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the time we checked in till check ##out we felt welcomed and were given a high degree of service . Smile ##s and courtesy from the Bell ##man , Front Des ##k , and House Keeping . Room ##s were Clean and Quiet . At ##traction ##s ( Restaurant ##s , Si ##ght Seeing and Co ##ck ##tails were all within walking distance or a short U ##ber ride . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary paper , coffee and wine service in lobby . De ##fin ##ite ##ly would stay there again on my next trip to Chicago . The GM should be proud of his staff . Well Done ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Extreme ##ly disappointed with room amenities . Up ##graded ( additional $ 60 / night ) to a suite which provided extra square footage , however nothing luxurious about the room . Extreme ##ly small bathroom / shower stall . No fan in bathroom , mold on ceiling . Line ##ns ( towels / sheets ) not high quality . Out ##lets out ##dated and several did not work at all . Dec ##or , view b ##lah . The staff was excellent . I have stayed at a few high end hotels in downtown Chicago and didn ' t think the room quality compared . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic service and location . No complaints . Staff very welcoming and polite from all departments . Staff appeared to be cheerful & enjoyed their work which is re ##f ##reshing especially in a busy , bust ##ling city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Starting with our check - in , Alfred was able to iron out a potential room change midway through our stay which was very much appreciated . House ##keeping also worked with our schedule and took care of our needs beautifully . Overall , friendly and helpful staff made the difference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we checked in to the moment we left the service was great . We were made to feel very , very welcome . The location is excellent . The rooms are very large - we were in the executive wing as a S ##pire Ambassador member . One morning I filled in the W ##i ##F ##i question ##naire and said it would be great to have more water and some fresh milk . 10 min ##s later both arrived ! Excellent service . Instead of using my watch to tell the time , I could just look out of the window and use the clock on top of the W ##rig ##ley building ! Chicago is a great city too . Really enjoyed our visit . Had an awful stay at the Intercontinental Barclay in New York recently so this put my faith back in Intercontinental service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Large and very busy hotel . Good sized pool , gym , with various food choices . Good location , wonderful views . On the down ##side , room are a bit dated . Walls are very thin where u can actually hear word for word what ' s going on . Staff is fine but overall unless you are in a convention or family stay with a well priced room , other properties are also worth a look [SEP]
1	[CLS] The desk staff were helpful and professional . Service in the St ##ets ##on ' s restaurant and The Living Room was excellent but avoid the other bars if you are looking for service with a smile because I have never seen more miserable staff in this quality of hotel - especially at the Big Bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have never experienced such a bad con ##cier ##ge service in a hotel ! They really do not have a proper training ! The level of the con ##cier ##ge personnel is very low in terms of hospitality and education . I did not feel any loyalty to the chain from their behavior ! Location is excellent but I do not think I would like to book any So ##fit ##el hotel if they have such a terrible customer service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I walked into room and was thrilled with the view . On first glance room was very nice and clean . Spa ##cious suite . Then . . . . the chair . Please look at p ##ic . I still can ’ t believe they do not remove this chair . At this price point it ’ s a crime . No refrigerator or microwave is for ##gi ##vable but not the chair . [SEP]
0	[CLS] When I arrived I was a little f ##raz ##zled and freezing from being out in the Chicago cold but as soon as I walked up to reception and Nicole smiled at me I knew the rest of my day would be relaxing and without worry . Nicole not only is a warm welcoming presence but she is extremely efficient and gets things done for you that is the e ##pit ##ome of the art of superb customer service . I have worked in several places doing customer service training and would be happy to hold up Nicole as what to s ##tri ##ve for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for business . Also used their conference rooms and catering services . They took excellent care of us . Room was spacious and had good amenities . Because it is downtown next to many other large buildings my rooms view was not nice . Also the reception being on the 3rd floor was slightly in ##con ##ven ##ient . That said , I still give it 4 based on quality , service and location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just can ' t get over the price for v ##alet parking no senior discount for it either . Then they charged me twice for one night . Still not resolved it ' s been 7 days . I asked for an upgrade in our room when I received the confirmation email to a corner room that wasn ' t even mentioned so had a terrible view . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here one night for a conference in town . Everyone working there has excellent customer service ! Check in was on 20th floor and has a lounge area overlooking the city . Room ##s were very spacious and clean . Bed ##s comfortable . While we didn ' t eat at the roof top Restaurant , we did check it out and will definitely give it a try our next time in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had stayed in Hotel Monaco Portland in July of this year , my husband and I went to this one thinking it be just as lovely . Sad ##ly , it was not . Given that it was a clean , well located hotel we did get good rest . However , the parking was $ 58 a day ; our television did not work the last evening we were there and we were just told the tech was fixing it ; when leaving Chicago we called down to the front desk to have our car brought out and no one answered - - until our fourth call . I am also wondering why everyone else has posted beautiful pictures and comments on window seats ? We had a window and a great view , but no seat / cushion - - room 71 ##4 . Again , this is a nice hotel , but we were looking for something more and would not go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chris made checking in / out everything perfect . The v ##alet guys are amazing , Perry was a rock star . En ##ti ##re staff is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and kind ! the bartender was sweet and made amazing drinks . Room was clean and had everything I needed . Location is perfect ! There is a little construction going on , but it was minimal noise . I will definitely stay here again when visiting my home town . The staff makes this place ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The place had great rooms and always clean . The food was also amazing . The staff got out of their way to help you out when you needed it . I felt really welcome to Chicago and Public Hotel . The no breakfast on the guest room though is such a b ##um ##mer ! I thought the hotel would have topped it all by having a room and breakfast . The little snack ##s , which are quite en ##tic ##ing , are charged a little bit on the high side . I felt they would be more u ##til ##ised with the lowest prices for the guest to warm up to the services further . Overall I enjoyed my stay at the wonderful Public Chicago Hotel . I love the name Public it always got me amused reading " public soap , menu , public phone " . . . Ha ha . . Thank you . Ra ##cha ##el [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ided to stay here because of the value & it turned out to be one of the best hotels I stayed in Chicago . Room was Modern , great amenities , local was superb & the staff was awesome ! ! ! De ##f will stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t on a trip with 3 friends and the experience couldn ’ t have been better . The staff was very friendly , and went out of their way to accommodate us . We were in separate rooms , and they got us all on the same floor without any extra fee or has ##sle , even when this meant up ##grading one of my friends to a slightly nice ##r room . Great quality at a very competitive price . I would 100 % return for another visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Family business required that my wife and I travel to Chicago for the weekend . In spite of the fact that the city is largely shut down , and the hotels that are open are very limited in terms of the amenities they can offer , the Ki ##nz ##ie was such a nice positive experience . Extreme ##ly friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , great rooms – wonderful floor to ceiling windows with a nice ch ##ais ##e lounge to sit and watch the city rest – great location , great v ##ibe . We will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently my wife and I stayed for a weekend get ##away and couldn ' t have been happier . The key to our absolutely superb visit was the personal attention that we received from the con ##cier ##ge team . . . from check in to check out we were treated as true guests - personal ##ized suggestion for restaurants , walking directions to several nearby attractions , follow up on questions via text . We loved the p ##amp ##ered treatment ! S ##hout out to Gerry , Alex , Jo ##van and Cole . W ##E ' LL B ##E BA ##C ##K ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay and have stayed at The Talbot ##t for many years and continue to do so . I ’ d like to recognize several associates who stand out to me and display fantastic customer service ! Perry , R ##oan ##a , Charles , and D ##wayne ! They are always happy to see us and they always go out of their way to make certain our stay is perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I come here many times at Ambassador Bangkok . This hotel is very near Saint Louis hospital for checking up our health . This hotel has really perfect location , very easy to go everywhere . Lo ##bby are clean looked very well . Staff ##s P ##uen & Fe ##em & F ##on at in the en ##tra ##ce are nice and very kind . Tomorrow I will go to hop ##ital and have a sleep well at here ! ! ! . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not impressed . Hotel has a very nice grand entrance . All elevators didn ’ t seem to be working / running . Room ##s very basic . To ##ile ##tries limited to cheap s ##ham ##po ##o , condition ##er and moist ##uri ##zer . A / c had SE ##R ##VI ##CE illuminated even after me reporting it . F ##ailed to service room had to request in the evening . Door men extremely helpful and friendly . Lac ##k of charging stations in lobby / lounge area . Need ##s up ##dating . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago Hotel is in between Rush and Michigan Ave . It ’ s within walking distance to shopping and wonderful restaurants . The rooms are spacious . The bathroom was huge and so was the television ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The All ##egro offers a great location in the Loop for visitors to downtown Chicago , with all the amenities you expect from a Kim ##pton property . The hotel is done in a fun , eclectic art de ##co design . You can expect free coffee and daily happy hour in the lobby , and Kim ##pton Ka ##rma members enjoy free w ##if ##i as well . The staff is court ##eous and the rooms are clean and nicely appointed . Room sizes aren ' t huge , which is only problematic if you plan to spend much time working / relaxing in your room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I came here for our anniversary and were disappointed in the rooms . They feel very dated inside . The bed had clear dip ##s and the sofa sa ##gged in the middle . The the ##rm ##ost ##at wasn ’ t working right and the room always felt s ##tale . When they came to fix it a very dusty filter was removed that dropped dust all over . I would not stay here again . There are so many options that for the price this should have been better . The location was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean room , friendly staff . Great place for a conference with many good restaurants within walking distance . Only issue - - elevators are slow and not all of them functioning . Had to wait as long as 7 minutes to get to 22nd floor . Very f ##rust ##rating ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff and v ##alet were extremely court ##eous . Clean room with great view . House ##keeping was quick and friendly . Great location . My daughter and I had a Sunday appointment we had to leave for at 1 ##pm and we were able to get a late check ##out without a problem . We arrived Saturday for shopping and sights ##ee ##ing and the location was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and property . Everything you could want in a top end city hotel . Very friendly and comfortable rooms . W ##i ##F ##i good . Michael Jordan ’ s bar in lobby was convenient . Close to W ##al ##green ##s for supplies . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here on a trip with a friend . We had a basic double room . The room was spacious . The bathroom had a separate tub / shower , and a pot ##ty room with a pocket door . There was an extra mirror in the room to help 2 ladies get ready at the same time . The location was good . Tax ##is were parked out front and there was an u ##ber / l ##y ##ft pickup spot right in front of the hotel too . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel went beyond my expectations to make my stay comfortable . When I realized I lost something at another nearby hotel , one staff person when to that hotel to find it . When he could not , he offered to go to a nearby store to buy it for me . The restaurant was excellent . I will definitely return , and recommend the Talbot ##tto others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is gorgeous with a great location right on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The pool and gum facilities are excellent - some of the best I have seen at a hotel . I would have given them a 5 , but when staying at a hotel like this , little things matter . For instance , the clock in our room was wrong and we were unable to fix it . We asked for a roll away upon check in and it was never sent up and we had to call for it . They didn ' t have umbrella ##s available for guests . Often , there were not enough people working at the front desk . Again - these are very minor problems , but when you are choosing a high end hotel , your expectations are a bit higher . That being said , everyone at the hotel we dealt with was professional , polite and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location for conference go ##ers , even at McCormick , since the shuttle buses and rides can go right down Columbus Ave . Excellent house ##keeping , but rooms are in need of a re ##f ##resh , no us ##b charging ports , for example . Front desk is small for this size of hotel and the staff there is often overwhelmed . Nice views from higher rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at this property a number of times in the past , but was pleasant ##ly surprised when I walked into the lobby . It ' s beautiful . My suite was also taste ##fully red ##ec ##ora ##ted . I loved the big striped chair . Very convenient location and although there is a 4 pm check - in , I was able to get into my room earlier ( but I know that ' s not always possible . ) Evening food and breakfast , while not high brow , were ta ##sty and convenient on a chill ##y day when you don ' t want to go back outside . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent 4 nights at the Ambassador , and enjoyed every moment of it . The room , bar and lobby were all comfortable , clean and beautifully designed . The services were also good . I particularly appreciated the old feel and the history of the hotel , as well as the location . Gold coast is a beautiful and safe neighbourhood , close to public transit , waterfront , beach , parks , and restaurants . I would certainly not hesitate to stay at this hotel on my next trip to Chi ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience , would stay there again and would recommend . The hotel was in a great location , walking distance to water tower and magnificent mile . The restaurant , 20 ##E , served one of the best breakfast ##s I have ever had . Also the hotel gave myself and my guest each a free beer or wine coup ##on and you could bring back to your room , and also each $ 10 off coup ##on for the restaurant . They allowed us to combine , so we got $ 20 breakfast . Would highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was perfect for our stay in Chicago . It ' s in a great River North location with countless restaurants , bars , shopping and theaters nearby . We took the commuter train into town and walked the few short blocks from Millennium Station to the Ki ##nz ##ie . The employees were kind and helpful . The room was clean and quiet and the bed was very comfortable . We will definitely go back to the Ki ##nz ##ie again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A wonderful stay in a f ##abulous hotel . Gorge ##ous quiet room , excellent bed , helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Especially Ricky the door ##man ! The best hotel I ’ ve stayed at in Chicago , can ’ t wait to return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a wonderful experience at the Chicago Conrad , The staff exceeded expectations and the location is always a great one for shopping and entertainment . Hat ##s off to Ana at the front desk and the Bell Staff made us feel like royalty . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel had the friend ##liest people ever ! This was our first time in Chicago and what a great impression they made on us . : ) We had a few things go wrong but they tried very hard to make it right . There was a lot of construction going on but that ’ s why we got such a good deal for this good location . Love ##d the old - world charm ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the Swiss ##ote ##l ! The people are always very friendly and the accommodation ##s are wonderful ! The rooms are spacious , comfortable and the views from almost every room are wonderful ! I have been a guest at this hotel multiple times and have never had a bad experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel ’ s renovation is gorgeous , they ’ ve done a fantastic job of bringing modern and classic touches . I stayed here for work and the staff was professional and polite . There are two areas that need improvement 1 . The room was missing some key items that such as towels . 2 . This is the first hotel I ’ ve ever stayed at where a guest has to pay to use the gym , that is ridiculous . The gym is nothing extraordinary and making guests pay $ 15 per use is ridiculous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very convenient in terms of location ! We stayed 4 days with a family of three adults and two children . Room was clean and comfortable . AC working but not excessive ##ly strong . We never had breakfast in the hotel as in the nearby there are excellent options : EA ##TA ##L ##Y and L ##E PA ##IN Q ##U ##OT ##ID ##IE ##N . We tried the pool and it was very pleasant . Service was fast and good . Re ##com ##men ##ded . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was an ideal location . Downtown and close to the subway . Many things to do within walking distance . The staff was so nice . They let us check in early as we had a very tired 2 year old . The breakfast was very good and I love that they had a dinner cocktail hour . The pool was warm and fun to play in . The v ##alet ##s were so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The cleaning crew did an amazing job . I loved this place . If I could give it 4 . 5 stars I would . I wish the pool was a bit safer for kids ( better stairs and lower depth ) but that is just minor . We will absolutely stay here again . . . . oh and the price was so low for the amazing quality . Thank you so much for making our stay amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were excited about our stay that we booked th ##ru Price ##line . Once we arrived we were told we had to pay an additional $ 130 in " A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tion Fe ##es " that we did not expect . Very di ##sa ##point ##ed . The hotel in general was ok . Nothing over the top but also nothing bad either . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located near the famous Michigan Ave . Dec ##or is lovely , room was clean . Staff was kind . Has a lovely classic and r ##itz ##y v ##ibe : ) My only complaint is that my room was near to the elevator , so I could literally hear the elevator ch ##ime every time someone called it as well as everyone ’ s conversations while waiting to get on . Could be re ##ct ##ified by asking for a room further down the hall . All in all , a pleasant stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is a reminder of by ##gon ##e times . Everything is elegant and state ##ly . Many shops and are ##s of the hotel to explore including a hotel museum . Service is top - notch . The hotel is within walking distance of many attractions including the art museum , theater , restaurants , shopping , etc . The train stops right outside . I had a corner room and for one person , a double bed was great . It might have been too small if my husband had been with me . There was a tablet in the room with all of the information about the hotel , local activities , things to see , etc . which was a nice touch . The room also had a snack bar , but items seemed a little high - priced and were subject to a high tax . This hotel is definitely the place to stay if you are planning to visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is clean , quiet and nicely decorated for the price . Simple hotel without a bunch of amenities . The history of the hotel is cool and they offer tours on certain days / times . Room ##s are comfortable . Only complaint is the pillows are small and soft , you definitely need to request extra ##s . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first visit to Chicago and we ch ##oos ##ier the hotel for the location and were very pleased Check in was awesome as was the room The hotel is a classic hotel with old world charm Great to see many of the vintage features Good value too [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has done an excellent job of preserving aspects of the old hotel with nice updates . Room ##s are quiet albeit a little tight . Great to be away from the more he ##ctic areas of downtown but still close enough to walk , as long as the weather is mild . A ##pp ##re ##cia ##ted being so close to the lake shore path . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , knowledge ##able con ##cier ##ge . Great rooms . Really everything great except that the beds had no top sheet . They happily provided one on day 2 when I requested one . Some of the best samples I ' ve ever seen in the room . I AD ##OR ##ED getting a new lo ##of ##ah ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a run down pile of p ##oop ! worn and p ##eel ##ing head ##board and base board . Te ##rm ##ite in ##fest ##ed closet . Wall paper p ##eel ##ing in bathroom . Paper thin walls to hear noise inside and outside . C ##rap ##py breakfast . and last ##ly tried to up charge me $ 30 a night for higher floor when Co workers were on 25th floor at no charge . Stay somewhere else [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located in downtown Chicago . We went for mothers day and the staff was so nice and welcoming of me and my 9 year old daughter . They have complementary wine hour , so that was nice . The rooms were very clean and up to date . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Fantastic location , minutes away from the best tourist attractions . The beds were like sleeping on a cloud and include all of the amenities one could ask for . Just walking around the hotel is a sight to be seen . This hotel has a lot of history and will take you back to an era that is rarely seen . We would absolutely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean environment with the lobby / check in on the first floor . Staff are welcoming and check in was efficient . The room was comfortable and spacious with a view of Randolph street . W ##i - fi was available in the room . Price of water was comparable with US prices however extra are priced above acceptable U . K . Price ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a business conference but doubt I would ever stay here on my own dim ##e . Bed ##s were very comfortable and had a great location with great views of the city . However , internet is extra $ 15 per day , microwave / fridge must be requested ( although website says they are included ) , I had trouble getting ah ##old of anyone to order room service , no one ever cleaned my hotel room and there were dishes from a number of rooms on my floor that just sat in hall way AL ##L day . They only got removed when I called and asked later in day . Front desk staff were very nice but con ##cier ##ge refused to answer my question until after he spent a couple minutes con ##des ##cend ##ing me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for one night and really enjoyed it . I was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews about wear and tear , but our room was lovely . The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . From the v ##alet who took our car and luggage , to the reception ##ist who checked us in , to the bell ##hop who helped with my bags in the morning , every single employee we encountered was professional and welcoming . Our room had a lovely view of the city and was spot ##lessly clean . Easy walk to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . My ON ##L ##Y complaint was that the shower had such low water pressure that it was virtually impossible to wash my hair . This was not due to over ##use in the hotel at the time , but rather to a fault ##y shower head design . I wouldn ' t hesitate to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice easy check - in . Small confusion at first , but I was accommodate ##d nicely . The pool and fitness center are very nice . Walking distance from everything fun . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed , excellent room service . Star ##bu ##cks and restaurant on - site [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel over the spring break with family . The hotel is beautiful and our lifestyle suite was big and well stock ##ed with all the amenities of a luxury hotel . The view was great and the hotel is fairly well placed to the happening places . Use the p ##ed ##way underground to get to places ! One improvement could be placing a microwave in the room or having one available for guest use - especially if you say you are a family hotel . I wanted to specially com ##men ##d Nicole for being such a kind , graceful and helpful host . She works at the front desk . Others could learn from her . We enjoyed our stay despite the breakfast being very sub - par and expensive . We recommend the Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At check in , we met Cody at the reception desk and he was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . In addition to making the check - in experience sea ##m ##less , he made out dinner reservations for that night and even checked in with us later to ensure we had an enjoyable evening . Well done ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at Hotel Ki ##nz ##ie while attending a conference . The location was fantastic - close to restaurants & shopping & river . River North is a party neighborhood - tons of bars & clubs . It can get pretty r ##au ##co ##us at night . There is a free happy hour , which would have been nice ##r if the the bar was in a better location ( it was , essentially , a box built in the middle of a floor - no windows ) . Some noise travel into the room from the hall way , but the on - floor breakfast service made up for it . Room ##s are nicely decorated & comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family - three generations - occupied three rooms here and were very satisfied . Room ##s are not huge , but we had a great view of the river which the kids loved . The hotel was just re ##ope ##ning food services , but everyone we dealt with was helpful and welcoming . And , who would have guessed there would be so many different kid friendly parks nearby . Fun stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my second stay at the Conrad and I loved it just as much as the first . The rooms are beautiful and sleek with tons of space and controls all over the place for various lighting options . the closet ##s are huge and so are the bathroom ##s . T ##ruly feels like minimal ##ist luxury . And can ' t beat the location . I also got texts from the hotel staff checking in and asking if I needed anything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice for an updated older hotel , but it is in no way a five star hotel . I was placed on a waiting list for a firm pillow . A waiting list ? ! ? ! They had the worst soft flat pillows I have ever used in my life . I even politely explained to them I have had spinal surge ##ries and I can ’ t sleep another night on such a horrible pillow . It made my stay absolutely miserable . Still placed on a waiting list for a pillow . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the 3rd visit to The Talbot ##t and as usual , we were extremely happy with the exceptional service , awesome large guest room with comfortable beds and in - house restaurant that is top on our list for both breakfast & lunch or dinner . The location is great - this Bo ##uti ##que Hotel is the only place my husband and I will stay when we visit Chicago . Can ' t wait to return . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand was nice and very clean . Great views from room and in the middle of everything which was very handy . Breakfast was a little over ##p ##rice ##d but there was plenty to choose from . En ##joy ##ed the gym and swimming pool . Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago for four days , it is located in the middle of the magnificent mile . The location is great , rooms were big , views of Michigan Ave . and the city were wonderful . The staff an accommodation ##s were wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our 6 - day Palmer House despite the lack of most food service as the hotel gradually resume ##s full operation . The bar was open with shortened hours . The lobby and bar are in ##pressive ##ly op ##ulent and the location is ideal for tourists . The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , River ##walk , Millennium Park , The Art Institute , and Chicago Symphony Hall are within walking distance and the Red Line Subway / El to get to W ##rig ##ley Field is steps away . Our room was quiet and comfortable although the de ##cor is a bit dated . Draw ##backs were a small bathroom , the lack of a shower grab bar ( we are Senior ##s ) , no in - room coffee service , and no built - in microwave . We would return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a nice hotel . With no major f ##uss and that is what we were looking for . We were doing a trip just us and it turned out fine . Any issue was easily fixed . It was great location for us . As that we wanted to be able to get to millennium park doing yoga or riding bikes along the lake shore . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the location to the helpful door ##men to the cookies and milk delivered each night to our kids , this was a P ##ER ##F ##EC ##T spot to stay in Chicago for a family get ##away . We were within easy walking distance to g ##ro ##cer ##ies , eating , shopping , and the CT ##A . The space and features of the room were great for our family . I would H ##IG ##HL ##Y recommend the O ##m ##ni Chicago Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has been recently renovated . The style is amazing , relaxing and relevant . There are two bars , a coffee bar , an outstanding restaurant with an amazing aesthetic . P ##lent ##y of space for group meet ups and casual conversations . The rooms are clean and comfortable . The location is convenient for working , shopping and the lake if you want to walk or run . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bad room service they skipped cleaning the room although the “ makeup room ” sign was on and when we called for room service no response for a whole day ! Plus not providing new bathroom supplies every day they only do the cleaning without checking if they is something needed to be re ##fill ##ed ! Really disappointed with this 5 stars hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] I s ##tai ##d six nights at the So ##fit ##el with a group . Organisation wise everything was perfect . Room ##s where neat clean and con ##fort ##able . Breakfast would withstand some improvement . Obviously the chef does not meet the French standards in terms of breakfast , and the general staff management of the restaurant should be re ##con ##side ##red . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay was perfect from check in to check out . Staff was very welcoming and efficient . Room was very comfortable and clean . I particularly like the marketplace where you could grab a coffee and a breakfast item on the way to catch the conference shuttle . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location for mid - Michigan Avenue access and to the theaters to the south . Was crowded over the weekend , but the staff were incredibly g ##rac ##ious and kind . Happy hour was a okay , good wine , very little food , but that is not what I was there for ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfectly situated in downtown Chicago near many of the excellent attractions this city has to offer . We stayed on a Fair ##mont Gold floor and the staff were very friendly and provided top notch service ( shout out to Del ##ores ! ) . We started each day with a delicious b ##uff ##et breakfast in the lounge where we could plan our day and talk about the excitement of the day before . Room was very good and bed was comfortable . Some areas such as the hallway ##s and the chairs in the lounge are starting to show wear so hopefully will be addressed soon . All in all a great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 1 night at the P ##U ##BL ##IC . Reserve ##d the deal that included v ##alet parking and free breakfast . Check - in was quick , nothing special . Room was a superior king . Very small bathroom - 1 person only . Breakfast y ##um ##my and delivered in brown bag ! During check ##out discovered that only $ 13 per person was credited towards the Free breakfast ! Didn ' t understand that since there was nothing mentioned in the rate description . Didn ' t bother to argue over $ 25 , but should have ! Also , it was rain ##ing and no umbrella ##s available - the con ##cier ##ge didn ' t seem interested in re ##sol ##ving our problem . Like ##d the location but service needs to improve ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our first time to this hotel on one of our many trips to Chicago . Really enjoyed our stay . The staff was extremely helpful and at ##ten ##tive . The room was clean and modern . We could see Lake Michigan from our 24th floor window . The location was excellent . Near enough but far enough away from Michigan Avenue . Near many excellent restaurants . We were very impressed and certainly would consider coming back on a future visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I believe we had a step - up from the standard king room . I would recommend it . Our room was spacious and clean . Lots of windows and a small couch with a table that would have been co ##zy to do work or eat in - room . Fu ##rn ##iture and d ##é ##cor are simple and modern , border ##line sparse . The furniture made un ##pack ##ing pain ##less ; I love the small drawers and cu ##bby spots for shoes , etc . There was ample bathroom counter space ( ideal for a female p ##rim ##ping for a night out ) . Having the co ##zy lounge and P ##ump Room connected for drinking and dining was extremely convenient in the winter month . The shower / tub comb ##o is nothing to write home about . Neither were the sheets or bed ##ding . View ##s are not a feature ( but I was on the 9th floor ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Chicago Conrad for the first time in Mid April and it was a fantastic experience . I would H ##IG ##HL ##Y recommend this hotel to any type of t ##ra ##v ##ler , leisure or business . Friendly Staff , Clean Room and Building . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked into this hotel for a conference . The room and facilities were as expected for a Fair ##mont hotel . The Fair ##mont Gold package upgrade was well worth the money . We especially appreciated the excellent service we received from the Gold Lounge staff with whom we interact ##ed ( Man ##dan ##a , Sharon ) . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a business travel ##ler this hotel is one of the worst hotels I have ever came across . The noise is constant from house ##keeping and engineer even drilling next door ! Last ##ly reception ##ist is beyond rude ! Other staff like bell ##man are charming , this hotel really needs to address these issues hence my post as complaining made no difference [SEP]
1	[CLS] Free breakfast and evening social . Spa ##cious suites . Fantastic location . Easy access to trains . Walking distance to magnificent mile , AMC movie the ##ather , and lots of restaurants . Beautiful view of the city on high floors . Fitness room and indoor pool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , food a little price ##y , but nice rooms . Most of the staff is friendly . The con ##cier ##ge lounge employees are the best , very friendly and funny and the food was good . keys de ##activated twice , security came us very quickly . had door lock batteries changed quickly and cleaned behind themselves [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have never stayed in a city hotel that is as beautiful and in such a good location as this hotel . The service is at a very high level , and with c and mass the requirements are met quickly and with quality . Breakfast is good but only mon ##oto ##nous . The lobby is lovely and has a beautiful cafe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly room , good amenities . Some workers were clue ##less , so don ' t expect much thinking outside the box , but mostly it was a pleasant stay . We got a nice room upgrade which was a highlight of the stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a boys weekend in Chicago and was impressed with this hotel , we ' ll run , nice bar and friendly people . Room was clean and quiet . G ##ym was okay as well . Had breakfast in the hotel which was fine . Would recommend staying if in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are very nice . Well decorated , and very comfortable bed . Just a block from the river . Free continental breakfast and even afternoon snack ##s . Like this hotel a lot . W ##if ##i is fast and good and the staff is very at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bed was sunk ##en and not very comfortable . Pi ##llow ##s are just ok . We found food and wrap ##pers in the couch ( thought it was a sofa ) . One pillow had a large hard c ##lump right in the middle ( scary ) . I ' m in a wheelchair and this room is not really very accessible . Not really sure this room would qualify as a suite in our opinion . There is a small wet bar and mini fridge . Staff , service , and food was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As expected , the hotel was modern , clean , well appointed and the room very comfortable . However , the unexpected and most impressive part was the person at check in who said , “ we have been waiting for you and your room is ready ” . That felt so warm and welcoming . Then he asked if he could help with anything else . Well yes , I need a good Italian restaurant . He took the time to understand my purpose ( business vs . romantic ) , described the perfect one and made reservations on the phone right then . I was impressed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in the Ambassador suite the elevator took us right into our room 40th floor our views were un ##believable ! The location is perfect right in the middle of it all . We also had dinner at the Mi ##che ##al Jordan Rest ##era ##unt that is in the hotel the food was delicious ! Great service . I would highly recommend this hotel to families or anyone looking to have a great stay in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Spa ##cious and peaceful entrance makes your check - in the start of a great stay . Different elevators for different part of the hotel . . . get on the right ride ! Many of them , therefore you never have to wait for a long time . The rooms are very spacious . W ##i - Fi , of course , that links to a customer satisfaction survey . I mentioned that there was no shower cap provided and I got it the following day ! Prime customer experience is for real at Intercontinental Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located and walking distance from main Chicago attraction around the Loop . There isn ' t any b ##uff ##et breakfast and you end up in the Star ##bu ##cks on the ground floor . Nice reception area but rooms and bathroom are small and the elevators and the corridors of some floors doesn ' t smell nice ! My room , even if near the elevator , was silent enough . I had a poor experience with laundry service : I used the service two times in a week and in both cases the laundry was not delivered on time and I needed to call guest services to get my staff back . The only reason I would come back is because it ' s 5 minutes walk from the office . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in this hotel for NBA AL ##L ST ##AR W ##EE ##KE ##ND . Overall my stay was great . The hotel has warm co ##zy feeling v ##ibe the minute you step in . I had a superior queen room which I found a little too small for my liking . The location is great ! 3 min ##s walk from the Clark / Division subway station . Walking distance from the Michigan Ave ( Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile ) The only con ##s during my stay was the noisy hotel guests ! There was one couple who fought during the night of Valentine ##s Day and the following Saturday night . I had to go shut them out on both nights . Also on Sunday night , another guest was playing loud music . Let ##s say that I didn ##t get much sleep during my stay ! Also the heating fan was very loud ! It would stop and go back on randomly : / PR ##OS : Friendly staff and very comfortable bed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very tired property . Room in north tower are small , extremely old and uncomfortable . Straight from the 50 ##ies . The same tower is also a very un ##sight ##ly building from the outside . Overall appearance of lobby is old and not particularly well clean , carpet ##s a ##ground the property are dirty and worn . Having a steak ##house right in lobby also does not help with the general fresh ##ness of the air . El ##eva ##tors are old and not working properly . The hotel could really use its location and the f ##abulous architecture of the south tower to become a landmark hotel . I ##H ##G should be more careful in allowing the use of its most prize ##d brand - Intercontinental - for this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Home ##wood Suite ##s was perfect for a family stay for my family of five . The staff was incredibly at ##ten ##tive , and it was obvious they took pride in the state of their hotel and the satisfaction of the guests . The breakfast , while busy , was always well - attended and kept fresh . The afternoon reception is a nice touch for a quick drink and snack when returning from a day of sights ##ee ##ing before heading out for dinner . The kids enjoyed the pool on the 19th floor with its great view . Best of all , compared to other downtown hotels , the price couldn ' t be beat ( with the possible exception of the v ##alet parking charge , but then again , it is downtown Chicago ! ) . Well done Home ##wood ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ll mention the clean ##liness and neat ##ness first - they were perfect . . . but the factors that stood out were the customer service , the de ##cor and the location . Jerry , at the front desk , not only helped me navigate a walking trip to the Sears Tower ( not Willis Tower ) but also provided a wheelchair so that I could s ##co ##ot my 77 year old mom around Chicago . The Vale ##ts were friendly and always ready to help . The de ##cor was lovely - gray ##s and na ##vies , neat modern design . The location was ideal - we walked everywhere ( over 5 miles pushing a wheelchair ! ) , except for one trip in a taxi . De ##fin ##ite ##ly would recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in the Hotel during the cold spell late January . the hotel is very well located and offers all the service that you need . the room was very good and warm in the cold outside . the bar and restaurant were very good , the breakfast was excellent . The staff was very efficient and friendly . i can only recommend this Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff was wonderful . The beds were comfortable and the room was lovely . The hotel was convenient and within walking distance of many restaurants and tourist attractions . The con ##cier ##ge was extremely helpful ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great location and a very comfortable and friendly place to call home while in Chicago . Whether you are visiting Chicago for business or pleasure , the experience offered at The Talbot ##t will make you want to return . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first time in Chicago and I was nervous booking with a hotel I ' ve never seen in person . The interior is very elegant . The room wasn ' t huge , but it didn ' t feel c ##ram ##med . The staff were very friendly helping us get our luggage to our room . In addition , the engineering staff on hand was very helpful when I needed assistance changing my bike tire . However , the most memorable moment of my trip at Hotel All ##egro was the amazing service of Erin in guest services . I had called prior to my stay to confirm my reservation and she was extremely helpful , genuine , and did everything she could to make me feel comfortable . Not only with the hotel , but with visiting Chicago in general . She was amazing help and I ' m very app ##re ##cia ##tive for that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##sist ##ant quality , and a staff that appreciate ##s your stay . After a trying trip they moved us to there largest suite , with a great fireplace , the hotel manager at the time Mon ##ique , even paid us a visit . We have tried numerous [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 4 nights in this hotel . The room was big , comfortable and clean . The continental breakfast was included . It was a self service on every floor in front of the elevator . You have to put what you want on your tray and then come back to the room for enjoy breakfast . The location is the best thing . The hotel is located in a very convenient location , close to Mill ##eni ##um Mile , river ##walk , shopping , restaurants and cool bars in the evening . From the airport is really easy to arrive at the hotel because there is L train stop near the hotel ( about 5 minutes walking ) . The staff was friendly . Great base for visiting Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Came for a quick trip the price was fair and my room was ready quicker then the check in , the staff was very helpful anything i needed they were there to help , the breakfast was good , didn ’ t have any issues [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Monaco when in town for a corporate board meeting . I found the hotel to be " co ##zy " or put otherwise the rooms were relatively small for a hotel in this price range . The staff was friendly and the door ##men very inform ##ative . Yes , there was the compliment ##ary wine , although the evening my wife and I decided to try it out , I did find that the young man serving was more interested in talking up a young lady , than serving . To be honest , I found the cost of the hotel high , at least higher than I am used to paying for more comfortable , or luxurious accommodation ##s . Of course then I found Chicago to be expensive compared to what this Florida man is used to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice room . Hard to find the little button underneath the night stand next to the wall that lower ##s and raises the window shades . Nice bar on 4th floor . A ##w ##k ##ward entrance on ground floor that requires you to take an elevator to third floor to switch to another elevator to take you to your room . No lobby to speak of . All employees very nice . Good location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every time that I go to Chicago I have as my first option the Intercontinental Hotel . It is luxury , well located and just a few blocks away from the main shopping area , attractions and restaurants , which allows to w ##lak to most of those places . There is a Star ##bu ##cks , 2 bars and Michael Jordan ' s restaurant in the hotel premises . The only in ##con ##ven ##ience is the high parking rate which is common in the area and the Park ##ing lot that is very trick ##y to reach , however , you can use the Vale ##t service in order to avoid the has ##sle to find the Hotels ' parking lot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel and location in this great city . Due to my birthday , we were upgraded to a king suite on the 17th floor . It is a corner room with great views of the city , a huge bathroom with a large w ##hir ##l ##pool square tub and all the amenities that come with staying at a Kim ##pton . The Wells / Washington L - stop is a short walk away . ( L - short for elevated trains ) The service at Kim ##pton is always on par with some of the best hotels in the world . They make you feel special and welcome . The room is stock ##ed with everything you may need , and what may be missing is a phone call away . We can ' t wait to return to Chicago and stay at one of their other properties . We just had a great time . Thank you , Kim ##pton ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location on the Miracle Mile with easy access to restaurants and shopping . The room , facilities , food service , and hotel staff all made being away from home a more enjoyable experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] High ##ly recommend the Conrad Hilton . We walked everywhere from here ( just off Michigan Ave ) . Room was great , huge walk in shower , very nice . We would definitely stay here again . Help ##ful friendly staff too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! The rooms were very nice and spacious . I would definitely stay here again . The only slightly negative experience was the lengthy check in and check ##out . However , Nick ##i , one of the front desk managers , stepped in and helped resolve the problem that we were having and she followed up afterwards . She was very nice and professional ! We can ' t wait to go back to this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk called my cell phone and room number around 11 : 45 ##pm to ask me go to front desk to pay my bill , which I asked the bar charged to my room . I asked why they call a guest in midnight to pay a bill and the front desk said because I didn ’ t leave my credit card information with them . I am sure if they checked their security camera they would find my did gave my credit card to the front desk as they asked when I checked in . I don ’ t know why the front desk didn ’ t keep the information in its system . It was a great hospitality for a guest ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is beautiful ! The photos online do not do the lobby area justice at all ! Our room was clean and nice . It was a little smaller than what I would have liked but it was just fine for the two of us . I would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I used Group ##on to purchase this hotel and have never heard of it before . Victoria booked us in and gave us the most helpful information for our stay . We had complementary smooth ##ies , the gym was amazing , hotel bed was very comfortable , the hotel was clean from top to bottom . The only trouble I had was with the map location it was linked to . Walking distance to Navy Pier , Urban - ka ##ya ##king , Boat tours etc . Note : there is an additional $ 20 resort fee . Otherwise , we would recommend a night or few with Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time in this hotel . more than expected . there on business with pleasure mixed in . Would recommend . Thought just a bit price ##y but it ' s Chicago close the navy pier . Room very spacious but surprised for a high - end hotel , no water in the room . wasn ' t a big deal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went on our first vacation of the year and Palmer House was the best choice . We stayed from January 18th until January 21st , Edward and Ke ##ely in guest services were very helpful . Con ##cier ##ge Nicholas and Robert gave us all the point of interest . The hotel is located in the loop . State St shopping , millennium park , Wills Tower all are w ##rith ##ing 5 - 10 min ##s of walking distance . There ’ s a ton of restaurants . The hotel itself has many dining and take out options . We stayed at the executive level the best part Being the executive floor has their own elevators and needs your room key to access . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great time with the family . Lots of options for eating and fun within walking distance . Great location ! Great view ! Great hotel ! We will be back to this hotel again for sure ! Super friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I took my mom to see Hamilton at the C ##IB ##C theater . Had a fantastic time . Hotel room was clean . We enjoyed the view of the lake from our window . Staff was very friendly . We were close to Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier . The restaurant at the hotel was great ! Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n was the perfect place for a trip with my sister and daughters ! We were in the middle of downtown with restaurants and shopping very close by . The beds were awesome , the room was very clean ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved the hotel and I was on the 23rd floor so the view was absolutely stunning morning and night . The staff was professional and court ##eous . I had to wait for my room since I got there early and the text ##ring system was great and easy to use . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at Kim ##pton Hotels before so had the expectation that this one would be just as good and it was . Front desk staff was universally helpful with directions for buses , the trains , movies etc . The location was very near the Chicago River and it was just a short walk over to Michigan Avenue for shopping , restaurants , and the # 151 bus which goes straight up Michigan Avenue to shopping and to the Gold Coast for great walks right next to Lake Michigan . The bed was very comfortable and the d ##rap ##es completely blocked out light allowing me to sleep in everyday . The restaurant was me ##dio ##cre but there were lots of places nearby for better breakfast etc . I also enjoyed my pet gold ##fish during my stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing hotel , great location . They had free wine during happy hour on the day I checked in . The day staff was great ! The night shift staff seemed rude ( maybe she doesn ' t like her job , who knows ) . . . . overall it was amazing I wish I ' d stayed longer ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here over the weekend . The v ##ibe of the hotel o ##oz ##es class . One tip is that there is a parking garage on State Street that you can park overnight for a little over 20 dollars . The bed that I stayed in was comfortable and the bathroom was so well made . The service desk and hotel personal that I dealt with were professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The hotel gives off the v ##ibe of being ups ##cale through and through and your stay there will be pleasant and relaxing . High ##ly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is phenomena ##l . C ##king in was superb and the staff was super friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Love ##d the de ##co and beautiful room - Many surprises that I don ' t want to s ##po ##il for your experience . Been to many of hotels downtown and this is by far my favorite . Thanks t ##yre ##ll for the bracelet and amazing service and Miller for the wonderful dining expertise . The food and drinks in the b ##ap ##tist ##e and bottle restaurant = Outstanding ! ! ! ! ! End ##ed the night on the s ##wan ##ky but co ##zy rooftop bar . Can ' t wait to come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location Room fair Custom ##er service not so much Why stay when there are thousands of choices in Chicago ? The employees don ’ t care if your there or not . I stay in hotels all over the world and there is little engagement on staff ##s part to make a great stay for the customer [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our experience staying here was phenomena ##l ! Our room had an amazing view and was kept very t ##idy . The location was great and within walking distance from all of our plans ! Will definitely visit again ! ! [SEP]

0	[CLS] Great stay at the H ##ya ##tt Regency - staff was friendly and helpful throughout the hotel . Very satisfied with clean ##liness of room . Food options within the hotel was great - enjoyed the atmosphere , food , and staff at The Living Room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Monaco for 5 nights and it was fantastic . Every member of the staff was incredibly friendly - they helped us with transportation options , restaurant recommendations , and were always quick to ask how things were going . The room was clean and had everything we needed , including free W ##i - Fi that was fast enough to stream movies . Also , the hotel has bikes you can borrow for no cost ( in four hour chunk ##s ) and the ride from the hotel to the Field Museum / Planet ##arium / She ##dd A ##qua ##rium / Navy Pier are all super easy and lovely . There are lots of great restaurants and activities within easy walking distance , too . I highly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The f ##rang ##ean ##ce when you enter the hotel is sophisticated , beautiful while soft , the staff is welcoming and helpful , the bar and the restaurants are great whether you are ready for a cocktail a night or want just a French c ##rois ##san ##t in the morning , the choice is yours and finally and most importantly , the beds are divine ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] There are better hotels around for the price you pay to stay at this one . The rooms are small and not was working . You would expect more for $ 500 a night . You can ' t even ask to get a late check out without being charged . [SEP]
1	[CLS] During the time of Co ##vid much has changed in the hotel industry . With limited contact the staff is still very helpful to make your accommodation ##s the best they can be . The rooms have great views of the city and the room we chose had a couch . The couch was nice for spending time in the room and ordering take ##out from our favorite places . The room is in desperate need of an upgrade . The bathroom could be redesigned to be more user friendly , i ##e towel hooks next to the shower . There was no food service due to Co ##vid but was able to use a food delivery service . The hotel even offered breakfast grab bags . I would stay here in the future . Only draw back was weed smell in the halls but that is our day an age now . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had the privilege of staying in one of the newly re ##mo ##dell ##ed rooms at the Chicago So ##fit ##el in the Gold Coast neighborhood . The room was gorgeous , spacious , and elegant . The staff was incredibly helpful and pleasant . As a bonus , this hotel is walking distance to 5 - star shopping and a wide array of great restaurants . I highly recommend Lu ##x Bar 1 / 4 mile away for great food at reasonable prices . Inc ##red ##ible experience and we ' ll definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our 4th trip to Chicago and first one not in the loop . I like the location of this hotel . Lots of restaurants and a short walk to Michigan Ave and 1 block to the red line . Room is clean and reasonably fresh . For a suite , it ’ s small , but plenty for two . A family of 4 would be tight . Main draw ##back for me was no safe in the room . In a large city that would seem to be a basic requirement . W ##ou ##nd up having to carry my backpack with laptop ##s all weekend . Wouldn ’ t stay here again due to that . Breakfast area was bright and well maintained . Food was ok . There was a young man there who provided excellent service with a great attitude . Should have gotten his name . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our daughter took a shower , grabbed a towel and this is what she grabbed ! ! ! ! We were off ##eted a com ##p for our Vale ##t parking and no other offer or concern ! Upon inspection other towels were found to be dirty . When we asked for new towels we were brought one “ clean ” towel and the dirty ones were left in the room ! On top of this , this was the worst stay in Chicago we have ever had . In the guest rooms you could hear everything going on next door and for two nights we had guest next door trying to open the ad ##jou ##rn ##ing room door . Our concerns were met with no regard or assistance . We would never stay here again ! ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] While this hotel is nicely located , it is beyond s ##hab ##by ! Every single piece of furniture and soft good needs to be replaced . T ##hr ##ead bare has a new meaning . Car ##pet ##s un ##rave ##ling and none too clean ; up ##hol ##ster ##y in severe need of replacement ; chip ##ped and den ##ted wood furniture ; ch ##ees ##y d ##rap ##es . U ##gh ! Public rooms dark and din ##gy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##pen ##sive restaurant and poor service in the re ##sat ##ua ##rant . Better options to eat or have a drink around the hotel than inside it . Miss labeled menu did not show what food was in season or not . Lac ##k lack of a microwave in the room was just a let down . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ' t begin to say enough about the Custom ##er Service at the Talbot ##t , Chicago . Chris , the Custom ##er Service / Front Des ##k Director , truly went above and beyond to assist me with an inquiry . In all of my years of travel , I must say this is the best experience I have ever had . In fact , reservations have already been made to return . I highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted recently for a medical conference and not an empty room . This massive hotel was packed to walls with foot & ankle surgeon ##s and healthcare professionals . Room on 15th fl ##it was spacious and comfortable and overlooking the Chicago river and downtown sky ##scraper ##s . Hotel showing some normal age in bathroom ( ji ##ggle that handle ) and desk top items like b ##alk ##y coffee maker ( on button very sensitive to touch angle ) . Bed was com ##fy as were pillows . Good room service ! Third time I ’ ve stayed here on business in last year . Would choose again . Staff was great at check in and check out . Good job H ##ya ##tt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is convenient to the mile and we did a lot of walking . Room was comfortable and quiet . Breakfast was good ( eggs ben ##edic ##t both mornings ) . Everything was fine , except I H ##AT ##E it when hotels charge me for to go cup of coffee in the morning . . I spent $ 160 in the bar and restaurant over the two nights three days we were there - and we had two rooms . Most hotels ( not all ) just put out a coffee service for their guests and don ' t charge for it . I don ' t understand the logic of making me wait for the hostess at the restaurant to get free to make a single cup of coffee . I think you should add three dollars to the room rate and be g ##rac ##ious with the coffee . Too bad I leave this hotel this morning thinking about this and that I took the time to write a review . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you go to ch ##ica ##go you must stay in this Hotel ! The rooms were gorgeous , the food was great and the am ##bian ##ce was wonderful . The manager Travis made sure we knew all the great spots to go and made are stay un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would recommend as long as you have the budget for it . Walk across the street to the museums and parks . Near great places to eat , beautiful building with history , the bar is fantastic with live music . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon arrival we were able to check in early and found our room was upgraded due to my birthday . Later the staff delivered champagne for the occasion . The staff was very helpful with suggestions for dinner and shopping . Great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ing at the Conrad for a few days on business and personal stuff . Te ##rri ##fic rooms and facilities but the people make the difference here . I ' d personally like to call out Ana ##sta ##cio on the front door as super friendly and a great help during my stay . I love when people at the sharp end of service go the extra mile . Will be back in Chicago again next week and of course I ' m staying with this great crew again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice modern hotel . Good rooms , good beds . Especially nice are the large windows and a cough / di ##van next to them . Giving you a view on the city . Free W ##if ##i available and enough places to eat around you . Check out in a minute . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in Chicago for a short business trip and had a great stay at The H ##ya ##tt . Staff was very friendly and room was spacious and very clean ! Access to many venues was also available as well as in house restaurants and amenities . Work ##out room was awesome ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an excellent property . A ##wes ##ome customer service . I had a bad experience with Holiday Inn Express and was able to get a room at the Conference rate right on the spot . It is re ##f ##reshing to experience plus plus C ##US ##TO ##ME ##R Service . It felt like everyone loved their job ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here in early August for a conference at the McCormick Center . The location was excellent , the hotel was very clean and the rooms were spacious . Bath ##rooms were large and I loved the walk - in shower , separate from the tub . Stay ##ed on the 30th floor and had AM ##A ##Z ##ING views of the river , the Navy Pier AND the lake . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in the west tower and it felt very dated . The carpet in the halls was worn and the walls were beat up and scratched . The bed was lo ##os ##ly made such that the bottom sheet came un ##tu ##cked every night ( I don ' t recall this ever happening at home or another hotel ) . I paid to upgrade to a view room , but the view was lacking and not worth paying for as I had to be standing right at the window to see anything . On the other hand the conference facilities were great and the cater ##ed food and drinks were great . The location is also very good with lots to see and do within walking distance of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome location , great accommodation ##s and professional staff . C ##ur ##b side staff is amazing . James could not do enough to help every day . Two blocks from the beach and a short walk to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent another birthday at this location based on my pleasant and previous satisfactory stay . Reserve ##d a Two Queen Bed ##s One Bed ##room Suite which was spacious . However , the living area sofa pillows were flat and uncomfortable and it was difficult to stand after sitting because the sofa is so low . The furniture could use a serious update ( Room 110 ##8 ) because it is so beaten down . Bet ##cha carpet ##ing would be brighter and fresh ##er if s ##ham ##po ##oe ##d . Bath ##room area is very large and b ##lah with a too low toilet seat . Location is great and Happy Hour is " Happy " , due to the gentleman named " Jeremy " . Food was also good , p ##lent ##iful and filling . Bed ##s are comfortable and a door separates bedroom and living area . Full sized refrigerator was a plus , worked well to chill our snack ##s , drinks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall very pleased with the O ##m ##ni . Little disappointed the W ##i ##F ##i was not free . How is that possible ? Location , service , food in the restaurant were all great . Fitness room was nice . I went with the parking and breakfast package and seemed to be worth it . The restaurant has a good breakfast b ##uff ##et . Room was pretty clean when checked in but bathroom could have been cleaner . Would consider staying there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Last minute Business Trip and my usual place was booked . Ha ##ppe ##ned across Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . What a find ! From the a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s , to the location and of course the service from check - in to check out . Restaurant ##s in area exceptional and love that you can order in room dining from Harry Cara ##y ' s . High ##ly recommended for business and / or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome hotel . 5 night stay . Excellent service throughout . Connie and Renee , evening hostess ##es in Club Lounge , were superb - - g ##rac ##ious and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble , and they added greatly to the enjoyment of the hotel . Looking forward to the next opportunity to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pen ##d the Memorial Holiday weekend here for a family wedding and our stay was great ! ! Travel from the airport via train was simple , a few blocks of a walk . Our room was clean , bright and quiet . Love ##d the cushion ##ed window boxes and the fun bath ##robe ##s ! We had 4 adults in a 2 Queen room and it was just enough space for all of us . As for the other amenities , the fitness center had a good mixture of card ##io , weights and space to move . I would however recommend a outdoor run along the River ! If you prefer to bike , the hotel has a few bikes that you can use for free ! ( I did not take advantage of this but saw others enjoying it . ) In addition we had a great time at the wedding reception , which was hosted right in the hotel . I would stay here again and recommend it to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visited this hotel 21 - 26 April for Grand ##son ' s wedding . I am 77 years old and traveled alone . The staff were exceptionally helpful especially Ali and Andre in the restaurant and Steven in the bar . Nothing was too much trouble and they were helpful in giving advice as to where to go and how to get there . The hotel was very good , clean and comfortable and I felt very much at home . The food was excellent and I would recommend the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker un ##res ##erve ##dly . T ##iara was a most welcoming con ##cier ##ge and the others were also most efficient . I stayed two nights at The Drake opposite and returned to the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for my food and the company - so that shows how welcoming the hotel is . Thank you all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My ##self and my husband spent the long weekend at the Fair ##mont . We upgraded our room to Gold status . This gave us access to a lounge and our own private con ##cier ##ge . The service was excellent ! Staff were friendly and helpful . Ma ##gi went above and beyond to remember us , our food all ##er ##gies and even sent us home with some of our favourite Fair ##mont tea . The rooms were clean , the breakfast ( included in the room rate ) was great , the compliment ##ary bike rental ##s were nice , and the hotel location was very convenient . I would highly recommend this hotel ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an extremely enjoyable stay beginning with an upgrade to a corner room with a view of the river and the lake and windows on all sides . The staff were all helpful and friendly from the staff at check in to the v ##alet ##s and door ##men who hailed us cab ##s and offered us an excellent recommendation for breakfast nearby . Alto ##get ##her lovely stay and sad that he hotel is all ready booked for the weekend we have planned to visit again in November of this year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is convenient ##ly located to Millennium Park and the theatre district . Navy Pier and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile are walk ##able . The hotel is nice - appears recently renovated . The rooms have double beds , not queen ##s . The " free " w ##if ##i is $ 15 a day ! ! The hotel restaurant is good , but price ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in June 18 for one week during business trip . Nice location overlooking the Chicago river . Unfortunately he rooms are dated and need up ##dating . The bathroom was absolutely not acceptable for a 4 star hotel it was more like a B & B . Date ##d , simple and cheap . Breakfast was rub ##bish , o ##mel ##et s ##mel ##t of burnt oil and very un ##hea ##lt ##hy . Even highway motel ##s have better breakfast . In general very un ##im ##pressed , not recommended and will not be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a ton of style and romantic charm , particularly in the common areas . You should not expect the rooms to compete with the high rise five stars at this lower price . It ' s a small bout ##ique , with small simple rooms and a convenient location where you can walk everywhere , and helpful staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean ##liness of floor 15 hallway leading to room an issue . The room fixtures were very worn . Mo ##ld and r ##ust spots were visible in the bathroom as well as poorly executed patch spots in walls . I have photos of all these issues . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel , have stayed before . Great service and amenities . Pa ##id for the upgrade to Ex ##ec level and loved the room , you can tell its 2 rooms that have been combined to make a sort of mini suite , spacious . Only complaint is the Executive Lounge . In my opinion , its not an executive lounge at all where you can relax i ##e no couch ##es or con ##cier ##ge or casual business environment , , rather , , its set up as a dining hall & tables everywhere with odd food choices and cater ##s to a lot of families and kids which creates a feeding frenzy . Re ##mind ##s me of a Home ##wood Suite ##s where the people come there and make dinner out of the snack ##s and scary past ##a dish they put out . Not sure what Palmer House is thinking here , but , I would do away with this format and create a nice relaxing atmosphere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel and had a wonderful experience at the kin ##zie . The staff is so ##oo helpful and they really do get it ! . Room ##s are spacious and very cool . A this place turned me into a hips ##ter at 68 . The only thing that we did not like was the extra $ 45 . charge at check ##out . The desk ##cle ##rc ##k explained that this was for the complementary breakfast and managers reception . That ##s like inviting friends over for dinner and then handing them a bill . . They should probably consider just rolling it into the room rate . $ 15 . 00 a day service charge for free stuff is kind of odd . Will we stay there again ? absolutely . we loved the place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visited Conrad Chicago during last week of September . I was supposed to be there for 3 nights but checked out after the second night . My room that was supposedly a suite was cramped and oddly shaped . Bath ##room was same . Poor ##ly designed and inadequate . View ##s from the room even at 11th floor were terrible . The worst was the restaurant and the breakfast on the 20th floor . Staff at the hotel were imp ##erson ##al . Park ##ing in front of the hotel was perpetual ##ly chaotic . If you like watching TV in your room the TV ##s in the room were large and good quality . Rest was me ##dio ##cre . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was downtown Chicago placed in a nice area surrounded by shopping centers and what seemed to be a metro station for transportation . The hotel has a few restaurants inside and a Star ##bu ##cks for your morning coffee . The rooms were very clean , comfortable and spacious . Overall enjoyable stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I are here for 3 days for family / friends visit . We both travel a lot . This has been a wonderful stay . Room is very comfortable . They performed house ##keeping on our schedule , not theirs . Since D ##H goes to bed early and I stay up late , they were very welcoming in the bar with my bath ##robe on . Work out room is very nice . My only complaint is that they have not " re ##f ##resh ##ed " the amenities . But all I will need to do is ask . We will be back ! ! ! Keep up the wonderful work . The truth spirit of hospitality ! Conrad would be proud . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place , great view . The New East side is quiet , but also accessible to everything . Bonus is Mariano ' s right across the way . The work ##out facilities , pool / hot tub , and sa ##una are very nice . Park ##ing is super convenient and you just download a Q ##R code to your phone . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is where I will stay in Chicago from now on . Amazing and friendly staff , imp ##ec ##ca ##bly clean , very nice breakfast , and a location in the heart of where we wanted to be . Room ##s were spacious and a great value . Even the view was awesome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely awesome hotel . I stay here every time I visit Chicago . Grant Park is directly across the street . Easy walk to museum , aquarium , art institute and more . The tour trolley had a stop right in front of hotel for hop on hop off tours . Staff is great . Room ##s are great . Have never had a bad experience . Room ##s with great views . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved to get a away we enjoyed our room with spectacular views . We went to dinner with friends and came back to enjoy the views more . We will be back and we have let other friends know about the beautiful room and views [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location to stay at if your looking to walk safely in Chicago . Everything is close by and hotel is a a great starting point . You can relax at their internal bars and then decide if you wish to enjoy a short boat ride or j ##ju ##st relax and enjoy the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful location . My bed in room 160 ##8 was not the best . The left side of the bed has a s ##lump in it . I didn ' t want to complain just let you know it needed some attention . I also had issued connecting to W ##IF ##I . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We used a suite on the 29th floor for meetings while my two colleagues stayed in the other tower . Work ##ed great for us , except it was a has ##sle to get our guests to come up to our suite as they needed a key for the elevator . I think a different system might be devised for folks to visit a suite in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great management . Stay ##ed in a junior suite , loved the extra bathroom and size of the room ! We had teens with us , and they were also satisfied with the privacy of the extra space of the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have made a reservation at K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker hotel for 1 night for 2 adults . Once , I arrived I found out that my reservation was for a king bed room ! The reception ##ist , his name is " Amir " told me : there was no two - bedroom left since I checked in late . I was disappointed and un ##sat ##is ##fied for taking that room , but I had no choice at that moment . After taking the room keys , Amir called and asked me to come back to the reception . I found out that he made an arrangement with other guest who checked in after us and had a reservation with two - bedroom . Also , the breakfast was not included in my reservation . Amir sent us a couple breakfast v ##ou ##cher good for am ##eric ##an breakfast for each . He was amazing and made our staying enjoyable ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love everything about this hotel . The staff is always helpful and friendly . Love the location and the price . Also , the lobby bar is so pretty and has such a warm atmosphere . The white ##de ##cor of the hotel is so elegant and I love the f ##rag ##rance of the lobby . Will continue to stay in this hotel and continue to recommend to my friends and family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are having a f ##abulous stay here in Chicago while attending Star Wars Celebration . The con ##cier ##ge Lucas has been above and beyond helpful . The bed is super soft and com ##fy for my husband and son unfortunately for me my back doesn ’ t like soft beds so I have been unhappy . Not the fault of the hotel but just bad luck for me . Super clean and friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Despite booking an executive floor room , this felt like a motel hotel . The rooms look nothing like the pictures . The spa was over ##p ##rice ##d with inadequate service . The spa was completely a joke . I spent over $ 300 and it was inconsistent . The slip ##pers were paper thin . The massage was incorrect to what I booked . The wrap was not evenly distributed across my body . I will not recommend this place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed with my husband and 2 kids for a quick weekend get ##away . There was stuff ( makeup ) left in our room from a previous person who stayed . We had to ask for bed ##ding for the pull ##out couch 3 times . I left an expensive item on the table next to the bed charging . I called 2 hours after check ##out as we were far out of state by then . I got a call 3 days later and they said they found nothing . It was my fault for leaving it but this shows s ##hady staff . I was also charged for a $ 45 parking fee when I parked I a public garage down the block that the hotel did not own . I can deal with everything but the stealing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful , it is in a really nice location . You can walk to all the places you want . The views from the room are open and nice open and nice . You have all the nice ##st stores around the corner . You also have supermarket ##s and restaurant ##es . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a historic hotel that is nicely decorated and has a great lobby area . Staff was friendly and helpful at check - in . Room ##s are very small . There is not a breakfast provided and the snack bar is extremely expensive . My A / C didn ' t work well and the staff told me to just give it 15 minutes to cool down , never came and checked it . It was l ##uke ##warm for my five day stay to say the least . To ##we ##ls were very thin . It does a have a great location , but overall definitely not worth the price . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at this hotel was great . Every single staff member I encountered was kind , friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . It helped make a busy conference an easier experience . My room was clean and had a lovely view of the river . It was very quiet and in a great location for visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was pleased with the location and the hospitality of the hotel . We were able to walk to the shops without any problems . We will stay there again . The staff out front were nice and helpful . The rooms were clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent welcome and check in experience and helpful bell boy and restaurant staff . Bed was excellent but room was smaller than anticipated and needed a touch up where some wall ##paper had got scraped . Show ##er was also very good . Hotel is well located a mile from the river with plenty of eating , shopping and places of interested within a few blocks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is a little older and a little less g ##litz ##y , but is also a lot more comfortable and affordable . Room ##s were modest but totally fine , service was good and everyone was pleasant and helpful . The location is right off Michigan Ave and close to the lake , making it easily accessible to the whole " Mile " shopping and eating area . The hotel bar was quite co ##zy and ended up being a great place to watch the Cubs win the pen ##nant . We would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Better located than their prior location ( now The Gwen , an SP ##G L ##U ##X ##UR ##Y destination ) from staff to dining , from amenities to style enjoy being wrapped in caring competence and composure Ad ##ja ##cent to the best shopping and fine ##r con ##dos this Conrad may be a model for the future of the brand Con ##cier ##ge ok Am ##eni ##ties on request excellent En ##joy a new an upcoming property in downtown ch ##ica ##go [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location - well staffed and at ##ten ##tive . I would only say that they seemed to have a lot of empty rooms and could have given us a better view . I always seem to get the more marginal rooms for family visits V ##S business trips . Overall the facilities were quite nice . The rooms are a bit dated and worn , but clean and all the staff is extremely re ##sp ##ons ##ive . I may try some of the other hotels in the area next time to get a better perspective . The hotel was really con ##du ##ci ##ve to walking . The folks in the market downstairs were just so good at their jobs . They manage things way better than a typical Star ##bu ##cks and had a good selection of coffee , snack ##s and food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was charged 3 times the amount I was told in the email I received about an upgrade . It was not easy to have this mistake by Hilton fixed . I had to make 3 phone calls and all in all took over an hour to fix . I am now skeptical of doing business with Hilton . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this hotel - - s ##ty ##lish and modern and very comfortable . I picked it as a central location where I could walk to the Goodman theater , the Art Institute and many , many fine restaurants . Service was outstanding . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Much better and cost effective hotels in the area to consider . The landmark location is dated - restaurant downstairs is limited , food just ok but way over ##p ##rice ##d . Service personnel are professional and court ##eous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t bother signing up for premium internet or expect to get anything of importance done . Extreme ##ly limited and intermittent internet service . Also apparently there is a 100 % satisfaction guarantee but it must not apply to Diamond Members . House ##keeping is also extremely noisy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed the hotel because of the location and it was a great deal . Ex ##pect ##ed it to be older and on the dated side . However it was not ! Class ##y , well appointed . Great location . Only complaint was that the bed was way too soft [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Great location in Chicago . Room was a mini suite and was outstanding . Only disappointment was the Palm ##s close at midnight Friday evening . Great drinks and snack bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is really all about location and a trend ##y inner - city style . The room and bathroom was really small and it feels like an old hotel with a bright shiny skin over the top of it . The view is the building across the street and the window pan ##e had a crack in it . Most f ##rust ##rating was the elevators - they were incredibly slow and there appeared to be only 3 elevators for the whole hotel . On the way back to our room at midnight on a Saturday night we literally took the stairs to the 7th floor as the line for the elevator in the lobby was 20 people deep . So if you want a trend ##y hotel in a great location with what looked like a great bar - and you enjoy slow elevators - this place is for you . ( And you don ' t mind paying $ 6 for an in - room bottle of very trend ##y water ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We did the American Girl Doll Store experience at the o ##m ##ni and it was great . The girls were delighted with their surprises . It is walking distance to great restaurants ( we ate at Rose ##bu ##d on Rush and they were excellent ) and the AG ##D store . The pool was perfect for the little kids and the included breakfast b ##uff ##et was G ##RE ##AT ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic location that is decorated beautifully for Christmas ! Very clean and great staff ! The rooms are very large , especially for a room in Chicago . We had a view of Michigan Avenue and enjoyed watching the people and traffic below . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I didn ' t find it very comforting in a chill ##y room at 55 degrees on a wet Chicago day . Tri ##ed to turn on the heat to no avail . Called the front desk and was informed the heat doesn ' t work until it ' s 50 degrees or colder outside . I had to take a hot shower . . . let the steam build up , put on all my clothes and then tried to warm up the room with a hair dry ##er ! I don ' t find it " q ##ua ##int " to be in a cold room on a wet day . I could cope with extra ##s blankets but am elderly or slight built person probably could not . Won ' t be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second time staying at the Intercontinental Chicago recently . There are excellent protocols in place for CO ##VI ##D , the pool is open daily for generous hours ( 7 - 10 ) , and staff is amazing ##ly kind and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The location is central with restaurants nearby having take out or safe heated tent spaces . Our grand ##ki ##ds loved the largest hotel pool in Chicago ( junior o ##ly ##mp ##ic size ) which was not at all crowded , rooms are spacious , the limited staff either anticipated or supplied our every need . Plan a visit next month ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lou ##d a ##c / ventilation system , and bed sheets didn ’ t fit the bed size . Not the most important thing but internet connection was s ##lug ##gis ##h at times . Otherwise , nice view on the lake . Friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , great location , and fast check in . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The only reason to stay at the H ##ya ##tt Regency is if you are attending a convention in the basement . The rooms are old and dated , including damaged furniture , ill - functioning p ##lum ##bing fixtures , and badly scratched walls . There are likely much nice ##r hotel choices at comparable rates nearby . The " bottom line " is this " Regency " is in serious need of an upgrade and re ##mo ##del . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful historic but very updated hotel . Had a nice large , double room facing the lake on 23rd floor . Great location - south loop on Michigan , close to lots of great restaurants . They pay attention to details . Fe ##lt very p ##amp ##ered especially how Cars ##arra checked me in . She definitely made me feel home ! What an asset to Chicago Hilton . Breakfast at the restaurant was delicious with plenty choices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well Known older hotel but completely updated with great charm and amenities . Perfect for business or pleasure in the heart of Chi town one block away from the Lake . Great restaurants and theater nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice property . Like the location and the size of the meeting room was very nice . We ' ve stayed at several other high ##end hotels in downtown Chicago , and I think we like this one the best . Staff very friendly [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , the hotel is nice and clean . Some of the lights in the room were not working . If you are given a room on the 5th floor look out onto a public patio limiting privacy and having to shut out natural light . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in a premium room for one night . Very slow check in process probably from lack of staff available . Once in the “ premium ” room , loved the lake view . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed there were no robes . Also , the bathroom has no fan so you have to open the door after your shower to clear the steam off the mirror . On our check ##out morning , the cleaning staff knocked on our door at 8 : 30 ##am on a Sunday . Our bad for not putting out the privacy tag I guess . The fitness center cost $ 15 day , the parking is $ 62 per day . If I wanted a bare bones hotel room with lack ##luster service and poor amenities , I would have gone to the Best Western or Hilton Garden Inn down the street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room with view of Navy Pier . All staff members very friendly & helpful . Love that it is dog friendly , makes it more like home . Fitness club not huge , however , good selection of card ##io machines & ample weights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time visiting Chicago . Our convention group was booked at the She ##rato ##n Grand . Happy we were as the location and hotel are excellent . Right on the river ##front so morning exercise walks were great . Hotel itself it very spacious and comfortable . We had a corner room which was huge with great views . El ##eva ##tors were fastest I have ever experienced at a hotel . Bed ##s extremely comfortable and staff was great . Really enjoyed our stay . Only cave ##at is the only morning coffee is the Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel . I ’ m not a Star ##bu ##ck fan and it is expensive as well . I wish there was a coffee shop or Du ##nk ##in near by . Otherwise excellent all around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] De ##fin ##ite ##ly a step back in time - rooms are clean and reflect the co ##zy charm of a historic hotel . Lo ##bby is breath ##taking and grand ballroom is not to be missed . Must be patient when waiting for the elevators . At peak times , it can be 5 + minutes before you get an elevator . Make it a non - factor and take the stairs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very disappointed . Too many mistakes . Was talked into up ##grading and was given a room that was already taken . Hu ##ge room - but T ##IN ##Y un ##ke ##pt bathroom . No mini bar and a fold down bed . The pool had a loose under ##wat ##ed lamp that had fallen out of the socket and the staff didn ##t do anything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Three of my ex - military b ##udd ##ies and I ( from 1967 ) met in Chicago for another of our periodic reunion ##s . This is a nice hotel ; the staff is especially friendly and helpful . It ' s a great location in the city , too . There is a nice cafe on premises which serves a variety of really great breakfast ##s at favorable prices . ( " Sign ##ature " two eggs , several strips of bacon and a heap of r ##oast ##ed potato pieces was my favorite for $ 11 . ) There is a nice bar as well , with table as well as bar seating . Entertainment , too . ( A Manhattan was $ 15 ) . This is not an inexpensive hotel , but I don ' t know how our $ 31 ##4 per day per room ( in ##c ##l taxes ) compares to others in the vicinity . On the negative side , the in - room W ##i ##F ##i is an $ 11 per day add - on . I didn ' t like that . ( W ##if ##i in the lobby is free , however . ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The customer service at this hotel is beyond awful . The front desk women Can ##dice Warren ' s attitude reflects the same lack ##luster condition of this hotel which could only be described as beyond terrible . Do not waste your money on this person or property at all . In case it wasn ' t clear , I would not recommend staying at this hotel if it were the last room available in the entire city . Be ##ware . . . stay as far away as you can . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was very nice and clean . It is in a great location to do and see a lot of different things in the city . We came to see the 2 MLB stadium ##s and the location was perfect . Would highly recommend to family and friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We live 3 hours from Chicago which means we visit A L ##OT . We also tend to book hotels that are 4 - 5 star and are offering a special . This time we landed at the So ##fit ##el . I cannot tell you how pleased we were . I honestly don ' t see us staying anywhere else again when visiting the city . The rooms are super comfortable ( I ordered a So ##fit ##el du ##vet online ) with amazing bed ##ding , b ##ose radios , La ##n ##vin toilet ##ries and robes / slip ##pers . We love the design & de ##cor as well . Le Bar in the lobby had a great selection of drinks , the breakfast was good as well . We truly loved everything about our stay & for a 5 star hotel the price was amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our children were in town for a color guard competition and the entire staff was amazing all weekend long . Charles , D ##wayne and Angie were very supportive of our groups needs and they welcomed us like we were family . The people working there are the true g ##em to this hotel ! They were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our large group of 30 + . I have future visits planned to the Chicago area and this will now be my go to place ! Job well done ! From the bottom of our hearts thank you staff for making this a memorable experience ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was here for both a race and to celebrate my first anniversary with my husband , and Hotel All ##egro did a wonderful job of making us feel special . They actually had a crack ##er and cheese tray , chocolate ##s , sparkling water , and sweet ##est note waiting for our arrival . The room was rather small but they did an incredible job of making due with the space and fitting in all of the special amenities and more , not to mention it was very comfortable . We were thrilled to be so close to everything and really got to explore so much of the city from this great hotel . We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to anyone looking to visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly staff , clean rooms , excellent location ! ! The rooms are on the smaller side for a suite . The bed was com ##fy but quite noisy when you move around . Whenever we needed something , the staff assisted quickly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While I can ' t deny what an absolute beauty the hotel is , I had two situations that completely ruined my stay there . First they didn ' t provide me any complementary mouth ##wash and instead directed me to find it elsewhere . Second , they didn ' t want to change me some small bills into big bills , also directing me some ##place . Both instances happened in two different nights with two different staff ##s . i was contacted by the management staff via email telling me how sorry they were and how it must ' ve been a mistake by the staff . While that might be true and appreciate their time in contact ##ing me the damage was already done . First time I fell like a strange in a Hilton property . Really cold shoulder from the staff . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel itself really great but what stood out the most was the excellent service we received . There was a very minor issue with our room and even though it was not the hotel ' s fault at all , they immediately worked to fix it . K ##wa ##me was the individual who helped us and it was the best service I ' ve ever received at a hotel . I definitely will come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Location , safe surroundings ! Great service , very helpful and friendly staff . . especially Craig , David and Edward ! Try to get a room away from the elevator , mine was across from the elevator which was noisy sometimes ! Just one down ##side , the hotel was on Heat ##ing mode and the days when it was warmer , i Had to open my window for some cooler air . . . other than that my stay was perfect ! Thank You [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good hotel , but not my favourite . The staff is not really friendly and the fact that they don ##t offer any kind of room service doesn ##t help . Location ##wise it is great , but i never had a very good view from my room , which is quite a shame . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been coming to the So ##fit ##el for the last 6 years or so and about 1 / 2 a dozen times per year and no matter what time of the year it is , the quality of services from the staff to the luxury of the rooms and bed ##ding to the restaurant and bar , everything is always perfect and exceed my expect ##ions . Family , couple , business this hotel is a f ##abulous choice and you will not be disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful experience in every respect from check - in to check - out . Man ##dan ##a in the Gold Club was the e ##pit ##ome of great service . En ##ti ##re staff was friendly , helpful and anticipated our every need and delivered solutions to any problems . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Hotel in Chicago is a hidden g ##em . Great location , reasonably priced , very good value . A little dated but half the price of The Drake across the street . Martin ##i Bar is classic old school hotel lobby bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location . A short walk to Michigan Avenue , Millennium Park , Navy Pier . Great restaurant ' s all around . Friendly and helpful staff . If you ' re looking to stay in downtown Chicago , give Home ##wood Suite ##s a call . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My girlfriend had never been to Chicago so I was looking for a class ##y hotel that would impress her . As soon as we entered the lobby we were both impressed , they don ' t build them like this anymore . The room and views were amazing , she can ' t wait to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have a bit of mixed feelings about this Hilton . It is an older property that has been updated . It has beautiful public areas , but is just a bit dated around the edges . I will say this , though , the staff is really top notch from the check in re ##ps to the housekeeper ##s . I have to call out my check in front desk re ##p , Cars ##arra who was absolutely great . She recognized my H ##H Diamond status and was able to upgrade me to a very spacious suite . I was granted breakfast privileges at their downstairs breakfast restaurant as they no longer have an executive lounge . The breakfast spread was really quite good . I was here for a corporate meeting and everything ran smoothly . So I give it solid four stars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel had a great breakfast and evening social . Overall , the staff was helpful and the room was clean . We loved having a kitchen ##ette . It was also located nearby a subway entrance to the red line making it easy to get around . Lots of places are nearby for shopping and dining . We would definitely go back the next time we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed the weekend with friends . Ex ##pect ##ed more for the cost . Room ##s were spacious , clean but furniture ni ##cked and worn . Our room was at back over alley . Every morning at 4 am the trash truck bee ##ped its way in , then glass bottles crashed into it for 20 min . If you are a light sleep ##er don ’ t sleep in rear . TV had a bad connection making it impossible to watch . Picture and sound was g ##ar ##bled all three days . I complained on departure and was given a $ 25 credit ! Plus ##es : they gave us a glass of wine for each day of stay . Staff particularly reception , restaurant staff , and con ##cier ##ge were a delight . Hang ##ing out with friends in bar area was enormous fun . Location was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is like an o ##asis in the area . Away from the busy streets and excitement of ch ##ica ##go , a quiet hotel to hide away in and enjoy some quiet and a chance to rest and recover . The bar also was well stock ##ed and enjoyable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel and great location The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful We were met by D ##wayne who helped us with our bags and gave us plenty of information and tips The rooms were spacious and clean and there was coffee in the lobby every morning I would highly recommend this hotel for your next trip [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only issue i got is i bought 1 co ##ke from their store and got billed for other things not purchased . I saw this a couple of days later on my credit card bill . Phone ##d to hotel accounting department . They concluded right away on an error and re ##fu ##nded right away . Had an email wit ##j the re ##fu ##nd within 30 ##min . . . that is what i call being pro ##fe ##sional . E ##rro ##rs can happen . Its how you treat them that makes you different from competition . . . con ##gra ##ts on that . . . will come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I earned a free night through my Travel Business courses ; absolutely top of the range customer service , excellent location , friendly staff ! definitely would like more free nights ! ! ! Coming back soon ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From check ##in to check ##out , everyone was extremely friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I truly felt like the employees enjoyed assisting us during each interaction . Tanner ( front desk ) and Perry ( bell ##man ) were extremely helpful . The attached 20 ##e restaurant was also fantastic . When we return to Chicago in the future , we will definitely try to book here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel and staff . Location is fantastic for sights ##ee ##ing , shows , shopping , museums , food and other attractions . Breakfast was spectacular and having a drink in the bar was special . Already looking forward to our next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed the stay . The breakfast is average , similar to Court ##yard . Fruit was not as fresh as I like , but it was okay enough to save spending $ 30 at a hotel elsewhere in the area like our friends did in their hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would recommend up ##grading to a room with a view of river or lake . Also , I would recommend up ##grading to the “ Club ” the service & food were great , visited it 2 a day , the staff was extremely friendly & a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Room ##s are a little out dated but well stock ##ed with your needs . It has a mini bar that will charge you if you move things so don ’ t stock up on items that need to be re ##f ##rig ##erated ahead of time . You can ’ t beat the location it ’ s smack in the middle of everything , you can walk to your location easily . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the kn ##icker ##bo ##cker with my fi ##an ##cé and one of our friends from the 18th to the 21st of April . I can not speak highly enough of this hotel or the staff . From the moment we arrived until the time we left the staff were excellent . The rooms are very well appointed and the hotel is in a great location . When I ' m next in Chicago I will be sure to stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wonderful return visit as usual , it is always so good to see Charles , Perry and D ##wayne again , and experience their wonderful hospitality and level of service too . I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough as is a total joy to visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice modern well designed and as ##ce ##tically plea ##sing hotel . Fun sports bar . Quiet room with plenty of work space . Large gym with many machines for a ##ero ##bic work ##outs and weight lifting . View ##s out toward the lake and short one block walk to Michigan Ave . Good for conventions and business gatherings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay at The Talbot ##t Hotel . The front desk staff was great and very at ##ten ##tive . They made my children feel welcomed and made sure we had everything we needed . Location was ideal to downtown and easy train ride to many areas . We were in town for a concert at W ##rig ##ley Field and this was a great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location to stay for the Chicago marathon . Easy to get to all attractions in the city and a short walk to good food and shopping . Room ##s were overall good , but I was disappointed with the dirty bathroom floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , good service , and strange as it may sound some of the cold ##est & best tasting water in our room from the sink we ' ve ever had . Strange , but true . Walking distance to several nice areas of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came for wedding and was assigned a room that was clean and so small to even reach for the toilet paper . The view was de ##pressing as I viewed the fire escape and the air conditioning con ##den ##ser ##s . The electric socket ##s were not accessible as the bed platform onto which the mattress rested blocked them . The room was clean ##sed no earlier than 3 pm in the afternoon . In spite of calling the front desk for linen ##s repetitive ##ly I had to go to each floor to find the one cleaning crew and ask for towels . I guess if you have minimal expectations from a 250 / night room then you may be happy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hi all , Really a superb hotel and lovely staff . I travel so much for work and perhaps it was finally my time to experience bed bugs . Re ##ception was very kind and brought h ##ydro ##cor ##tis ##one cream at 2 ##am when I was it ##chy . I am sure in cold weather this is a common phenomenon . Don ' t let this colour the hotel and staff thought . T ##ruly great people and the la ##tte each morning was fantastic ( from an Au ##ssie who misses coffee back home ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great View of the Park , even as just a basic room booking . Nice to have a separate shower and bath and coffee and TV with Stream ##ing access . Everything you ’ d expect of a Fair ##mont and enjoyed the Beer place downstairs as well . Not overly grand and giant feeling , but quite co ##zy . Location is a short 5 min s ##tro ##ll to things , not directly on top of them , but that ’ s actually pleasant . Alto ##get ##her highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we reserve king bed , did not get it , staff don ' t care . Our check in agent told us ; f ##rist come f ##rist serve . Then the room heat ##er cover was not installed properly and very dirty was very disappointed . I have been to this hotel before for events and this was the worst experience ever , truly disappointed for new years ballroom party . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Eddie at the bar is fantastic ! So friendly and the entire staff is so professional . Room ##s well appointed with a great lake view . Bed ##s very comfortable . Of course , the location is un ##beat ##able . They have upgraded the elevators such that there is no longer a wait . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I traveled 7 hours to come here and got the worst service ever from the front desk re ##p name Jason . He was very rude to the point I decided to check in at the hotel across the street . After leaving I called him to get corporate number and he replied “ Google it ” I definitely would not recommend this hotel . With them prices I should have got great customer service . What a night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed our stay at this property . Staff were very friendly . Breakfast & evening social event provided quite a variety of options to select from . Staff there to re ##su ##pp ##ly items & clear away trash quickly . Held back excellent rating because pool was still not available due to " re ##mo ##del ##ing " . That was a significant factor in choosing this hotel . Note ##d earlier comment from management , re ##mo ##del ##ing to be completed by Jun 5 . Unfortunately , not so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient location along the river and river ##walk in a mix of attractive older buildings and very contemporary steel and glass towers . My room viewed the city , and not Lake Michigan , including the Trump Hotel and Tower with its large capital letters reading T ##R ##UM ##P on the side facing the river . The meeting spaces were adequate and the overall facilities were good . My room was of a nice size but it did have some background noise from traffic crossing the metal deck ##ing of the lift bridge below . The bathroom should be updated . The tub floor looked gray and the face of several of the bath tiles was p ##eel ##ing . Apparently club level rooms have been updated . The hotel is showing a bit of age and dated by its architecture . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really a pleasant experience ! ! Room ##s very clean and t ##idy . The hotel staff was at ##ten ##tive and nice . El ##eva ##tors were quick despite the large crowds ! No complaints and will visit again . ( I did not get a chance to din ##e there ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago is an amazing hotel that has many places to eat and relax . The conference rooms and the grand ballroom are beautiful . The rooms are clean and recently re ##nn ##ova ##ted . My 17th floor view of lake Michigan was amazing [SEP]
1	[CLS] C ##log ##ged tub drain for the duration of our stay ( after not ##ifying management twice ) and lack of coffee maker in the suites made the stay less than average . We did not feel we received adequate value for what we paid . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great facilities and comfortable ones , everything was great for a new years experience ( just avoid the room next to the ice machine ) . The hotel is close to everything so u can walk and go to most stores without problem ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , great service and the rooms are all suites so you have plenty of space . Nice arrival gift too that is brought to your room plus turn ##down service . I would definitely stay here again and recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights at the So ##fit ##el Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for a conference . The check - in and check - out experiences were very smooth and so easy . I arrived early and was going to just check my luggage , but they secured a room for me to check in early . The room I stayed in was very luxurious and clean , comfortable beyond belief . Great hotel , great location , great staff ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wanted to experience how a luxury hotel feels like and stayed at Conrad Chicago when it available for about $ 250 per day . Room , Bed , Bath ##room are super clean , Bath accessories are high quality , everything is digital , great TV : - ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great weekend as a couple at So ##fit ##el Chicago ! Our junior suite was luxurious and imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , the view was amazing , the bed was ridiculous ##ly comfortable , the marble bathroom was gorgeous . Con ##cier ##ge was very friendly and helpful setting up tours on our behalf and providing local insights . Check in and out were efficient . Location was convenient ##ly located very close to transit , the neighbourhood is safe and beautiful , loved the walking distance to all the sights of the loop . Nothing negative to say . We ' ve stayed in Chicago hotels before and this was by far the nice ##st ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel ! Best location ! everything is in walking distance and u ##ber wasn ' t expensive ! To ##ns of restaurants in the area many walking distance ! Also very close to the loop and Michigan Ave ! The hotel itself was beautiful ! The staff was friendly ! Many eating spots in the hotel and a star ##bu ##cks which was very helpful ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was my birthday and a few colleagues and I decided to explore our love of luxury hotels and this experience was not good for us at all . Upon check - in I was profile ##d , meaning i was judged by my appearance , as were my colleagues . The way the desk attendant and his supervisor treated me was extremely dish ##ear ##ten ##ing and di ##s ##res ##pect ##ful . The next problem was involving being over ##charged for my room . The way that this situation was " resolved " was very poor . The way I was treated completely ruined my birthday . Furthermore , the room did not have a microwave at the least . I did not care for the fact that there were not bath ##tub ##s in the bathroom ##s . Overall , the touch ##points were not up to par with my expectations and now I will never return back to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Michigan Ave location . The staff is very helpful and speed ##y ! The room is spacious and the bathroom enormous ! Our room even had a N ##es ##press ##o coffee maker . The first night we couldn ' t figure out how to close the blind ##s only to discover they are electric . You can lay in your bed and open and close them . Very impressive ! My family of 4 had a wonderful stay at The Conrad . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we arrived at the Conrad we were in awe , it ' s really cool that the main lobby is on the 20th floor . Food was excellent rooms were very nice , I really can ' t wait to stay at the Conrad Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came in for a three - day stay and were upgraded to a suite based on our Platinum Status . We have been staying in the So ##fit ##el several times a year for over ten years and we wouldn ’ t even consider staying at a different hotel . The facility and amenities are great and the staff is wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First , we ' re hit with an unexpected $ 300 deposit at check in , what ? ! ! ! The elevators are so SL ##OW ! The breakfast is LA ##ME ! Sara Lee pound cake for breakfast , really ? ! ! ! The room temperature is controlled by the hotel , really ? ! ! ! The only thing that gives me some comfort is the room rate compared to most other hotels in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic hotel & at ##ten ##tive staff . I ##dea ##l location , walk ##able from so many areas . Third year staying there & no regret ##s ! The special rate for the weekend is an en ##tic ##ement , but the service & surroundings keep me coming back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el Chicago is right in the heart of shopping and visitor activities . Beautiful ##ly re ##mo ##del ##ed hotel , lovely suites and rooms . We hosted a post - wedding br ##unch in Le Bar and Pat ##io area for 150 people . The service was excellent and food superb . We highly recommend this location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome hotel staff ! I stay here 1 - 2 times a year for business travel , and almost every visit has been a good one . Pro ##s : - Excellent Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary Coffee / Tea in AM ( in lobby ) - Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary wine in evening ( in lobby ) - Great con ##cier ##ge . Mark is the Man ! ! - Room ##s are usually big , only once I was given a very small room , but they quickly , ( no f ##uss ) moved us up to a better room - they store luggage Con ##s : I always rent a room with j ##ac ##uz ##zi to un ##wind after my he ##ctic schedule , and I have always had to ask for someone to come up and thoroughly clean the tub . - Also , all the bathroom ##s I ' ve had with j ##ac ##uz ##zi ##s have a bad entry layout that blocks the toilet area , when opening door , which gets f ##rust ##rating , as I ' ve s ##tub ##bed my toe trying to get behind door to toilet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When you walk in and up to the second floor to the main lobby area , it takes your breath away . Gorge ##ous f ##res ##cos and marble of an era gone by . The wait to check in was disappointing and the Front desk staff was average . The styling ##s and elevators in the public areas transport you to the early 1900s el ##egan ##ce . Once in the room , I kept looking for more . Everything is tiny ; room not much bigger than the bed , where to put my suitcase ? ? , bathroom counter couldn ’ t hold my stuff . If I had my family with me , it would be insufficient . Wall ##paper was pretty , but corners were all p ##eal ##ing up . No clock in the room , limited plug ##s . All signs that rooms need up ##dating to accommodate today ’ s travel standards . It ’ s a huge hotel but rooms too small . Therefore , expensive for what it was . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I would like to take a moment to highlight excellent service I received from front desk member Cody . At check in Cody was welcoming and professional . When he found out that my girlfriend was not feeling well , he personally delivered tea to our room . Because of Cody , we had a wonderful experience . The cleaning staff was also extremely friendly ! Would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived quite late and were checked in by a lovely reception ##ist . She recommended we upgrade to a suite to enjoy our stay to the ma ##x . Although I didn ’ t want to go to the extra expense , she talked me into it ! ! ( Well trained ) I would recommend anyone visiting Chicago for an extended time to stay in room 121 ##7 . It is like a home away from home . Co ##m ##fy bed , well appointed lounge with N ##es ##press ##o machine - an essential item for a coffee fi ##end in the US and one of the reasons I chose this hotel . The room is quiet and it has lovely aspect out onto the city . The staff are exceptionally friendly ( without attitude ) yet disc ##reet and helpful and genuinely look after you to make sure everything is perfect [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in town for a short business trip and decided to stay at So ##fit ##el for the first time because it is very close to Michigan Avenue and the location was just perfect ! Everyone at the hotel are exceptional especially Chan ##da , she is just too friendly and always try to help me if I need something . She mentioned that she was just a train ##ee and only on her first week but the way she work seems like she ' s been there for a long time . Can ' t wait to come back and stay in your hotel again ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Man ##dan ##a and Sharon were experts of hospitality . High ##ly recommended . Room ##s are top notch . Turn down service with warm lighting , light classical music , and a compliment ##ary bottle of water waiting for your return . This was a perfect experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An excellent property . S ##mo ##oth , cord ##ial check - in . Nice room - - spot ##less house ##keeping , very nice furnishings , huge TV , comfortable bed . No bath , but I don ' t need that , and the shower was great . My room was not huge but I never felt cramped . Room faced Michigan Avenue . I heard sire ##ns occasionally , but otherwise no noise . Hilton Diamond benefit is now continental breakfast ( no longer $ 15 credit . ) The breakfast p ##latter was great - - attractive , ta ##sty , and all one could want in quantity . Will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the minute we stepped out of our taxi to the minute we left . . . . top notch service ; beautiful , clean hotel ; g ##rac ##ious , at ##ten ##tive staff ! American Girl package was perfect ! Even surprise birthday cake waiting in our room for my daughter when we returned from our evening out . Best hotel experience E ##VE ##R ! We will ##ie customers for life ! Thanks for a fantastic trip ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 2 nights at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Chicago . Everything was perfect from check in to check out . We loved the location and walked to tons of destinations throughout the city from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great friendly service from all staff for every interaction . Very comfortable beds and rooms . Very convenient having a N ##es ##press ##o machine in the room too . Location is great being right next to Ma ##g Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was large with all the amenities . Lo ##bby bar offered some very ta ##sty small plate food options to have with our drinks . I usually use the fitness center when I am traveling . The fitness center at Swiss ##ote ##l is the best hotel fitness center I have ever seen . It ' s on the top floor , with great views of Navy Pier , the river area , and downtown . Very spacious , clean , and plenty of equipment options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n is in a great location with views of the Chicago river or Lake Michigan from some locations . I was here for a convention so it was crowded , noisy and expensive , but in general the hotel staff did a better than average job of handling it . The conference areas merge with the regular hotel space , so I would not have wanted to stay here if I was not at the convention as it would have been unpleasant if not part of the group . Food options were me ##dio ##cre at best and over ##crow ##ded . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The furnishings and bed were very com ##fy and modern . It was a very enjoyable stay . The location is a bit out of the way for night ##life but great if you are planning to relax . It is also close enough to the Loop train that you don ' t need a car / taxi to get to / from the Midway Airport . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Historic location , nice , efficient staff , wonderful location , reasonably comfortable beds . However , expect to pay $ 15 a day to use the gym , the restaurants are more expensive than their food warrant ##s ( although they do make good drinks ) ; expect room service to take at least an hour ; the elevators are a little reluctant to close ( which always makes me nervous ) and could use a tune up . When I return to Chicago , I ' ll probably stay at a different hotel in the Hilton portfolio . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel and great location . Staff was great . Found an awesome deal on Hot ##wire and we booked a one night stay . We did a stay - cat ##ion in Chicago . We had breakfast at their restaurant . Their past ##ries are pretty y ##um ##my . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency Hotel Chicago is a great hotel with great customer service ! The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful . My room was clean and the bed was comfortable . I have stayed at this property in the past and will continue to when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay ! My husband and I spent 2 nights at the hotel . Very convenient location to see downtown . Room ##s are nice and clean . Nice staff . Easy check in and check out . Overall great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Heat ##ing is not good in the rooms in the west tower . Room is still freezing even at 80 degrees . Not comfortable at all ! I would avoid even how cheap it is advertised . And this is not even proper ch ##ica ##go winter ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel with a very nice location Staff was both friendly and professional Restaurant ##s were great with pricing and taste . Room ##s were very clean and comfortable . It ' s a large hotel but you never feel lost in it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the Swiss to give the kids something to do . They had an amazing time . I was impressed with the front desk representative Lane ##tte Silas . She was hi ##lar ##ious the kids loved her and she made sure to give us great tourist attractions for our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was nicely sized with the usual amenities , couch , big t ##v , iron ##ing board , hair ##dr ##yer . The ##location is excellent as it is very close to the Me ##rch ##and ##ise Mart and downtown Chicago attractions that one can walk to easily . The only criticism I have is the breakfast room which doubles as the happy hour room . I feel the room is rather de ##pressing and in need of moving to an outside location or re - de ##cor ##ati ##n in a more up to date . style . Breakfast , while satisfactory , was nothing special and cu ##ld also be improved with made to order en ##tree ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Still give the Home ##wood 5 stars because even though it was crowded during spring break , everything was up to my expectations . Great breakfast and close to many restaurants to eat at night . I always like coming back to this hotel whenever I am in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ’ t say enough about my recent about the clean ##liness of the facility and particularly my room / floor . Tracy on 39 Floor does a fantastic job and is extremely persona ##ble . I stay in a hotel 120 nights a year and she really stands out . Great hotel and love the updates to the Palm ##s Restaurant ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything was amazing about the stay - I received an unexpected upgrade to a suite . The space was luxurious and the bed was so comfortable . I also enjoyed the Le Lab ##o toilet ##ries and the tea selection . The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful - they made me feel welcomed and valued during my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Friendly staff . Wish ##ed this hotel had a pool and water stations near check in . Great to have an upgrade to a bigger room and a view . Many elevators to get to room , so didn ' t have to wait long . Room had a separate shower and a tub , which is rare in other hotels . Using rides ##hare ##s was easy at the Fair ##mont . Although some service staff are unfamiliar how to use the F ##PC certificates at their drinking establishments [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I purchased a stay at the hotel I honestly had never heard of it and I am from Chicago . We checked in last Friday and W ##OW what a place . The staff is A + and the location is perfect . You are literally a short walk to Michigan Ave . State St . The Hancock , Ma ##g Mile , the lake and on and on and on . There is a great little bar and restaurant and the phrase bout ##ique hotel is perfect . We loved the room and lobby and enjoyed a late drink in a nice little lounge off to the side of the lobby . Any local or tourist will love the hotel and it ' s location and staff are i ##cing on the cake . A special thank you to Mir ##sad ##a who made our stay even more special , she is a credit to The Talbot ##t Hotel . We are locals but for our next special night downtown , we will be at The Talbot ##t [SEP]
1	[CLS] An old hotel with lots of charm and history but in minor need of a l ##I ##ck of paint and a new carpet or two . The common areas are very well done and good places to hang out but the rooms are just a bit below the standards you would expect of a hotel in this range . The large beds and smart TV ##s are great but the floor ##ing and the corridors on room level just need a bit of a re ##fu ##rb . However , the bathroom ##s are good , rooms are clean and the hotel has good service . Dec ##ent value and a brilliant location for downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What I really really like about this hotel is their huge space . Their suites have a separate bedroom and living room . The bedroom has twin ##bed ##s and a sofa ##bed in their living room which could really accommodate a whole family . Their kitchen is also fully furnished with a big fridge . There is also a free hot breakfast ! Will definitely stay here again on my next visit in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you like a quiet room in which to sleep , stay away from this hotel . The windows are not properly ins ##ulated because even on the 16th floor , I could hear every ho ##nk . I asked for a quiet room and I was placed next to the elevators . The water pressure horrible but I ’ m not sure if it ’ s just in my room . I tried this hotel because it ’ s new to H ##ya ##tt but I should have stick ##ed to the Fair ##mont . Never again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I recently spent a Saturday night as a Christmas gift from our two amazing children . We love the area of Chicago So ##fit ##el is located in and despite the cold weekend , we had an amazing time . So ##fit ##el is close to fantastic food , coffee and shopping ! Thanks to our kids . . . and to So ##fit ##el for a nice " mini " vacation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed a weekend for some shopping , parade and holiday cheer . We have been coming to Chicago for years and this has slowly become our go to place . The location is perfect to walk to restaurants and shopping . The architecture is stunning and views are so nice . Bed ##s are comfortable , bath is spacious , coffee in room , water provided . Quiet room to s ##no ##oz ##e away in . Staff always friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Vale ##t parking . We always have a beverage in beautiful lounge with wonderful fireplace and expert ##ly prepared cocktail ##s . Breakfast in restaurant not to be missed . Another great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel management poor , no house ##keeping services . Front desk R ##ude . U ##gh the list goes on and on . Oh Flood ##ed Room ##s . El ##eva ##tors broke . Con ##stant Run around regarding services . Would not recommend this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great four days stayed in June . Con ##cier ##ge , front desk , and staff very court ##eous and helpful at all times . Food was excellent and overall was very relaxing and enjoyable stay . Evening turn down service was a nice addition to my stay . I liked that there were three separate rooms : bedroom , living area and bathroom that could be separated with pocket doors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Other than a crowded front drive and difficulty getting a cab / u ##ber the hotel was a perfect spot to set up camp for my meeting at McCormick Center . Nice restaurant , fine rooms , good service . Star ##bu ##cks coffee shop in lobby with breakfast items / don ##uts perfect for grab and go mornings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago was One of the Best Hotels I have ever stayed at ! I travel often for business and was blown away from walking into the Conrad , with the Lo ##bby on the 20th floor to the R ##oof ##top Bar . As Diamond Member of Hilton getting a $ 30 a day meal credit is also huge when traveling for work ! Thank you Conrad Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] We held our daughter ' s wedding here on New Year ' s Eve . It went great . The hotel event staff are super to work with . The front desk and restaurant staff was also great . Overall the wedding went extremely well and we had a great time . Very class ##y black tie affair as my daughter requested . Almost 200 guests . The food was fantastic ! . Ser ##ved hot and extremely well portion ##ed . Everyone commented on the food and how good it was . So many weddings it is served cold or over cooked . The All ##egro got it right . The entire 3 days went of with only one hit ##ch which I was taken care of a soon as possible . Did not end up impact ##ing the event . Most importantly , bride and groom loved the whole weekend ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The business suites had a small living room with a refrigerator and a coffee pot with decent coffee . Lots of room in the bathroom and the overall room itself . I would definitely stay at this O ##m ##ni Hotel in Chicago again ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a lobby that ’ s not to be missed , a real piece of Chicago history . A great property at a great location if you ’ re spending time downtown . Price ##s are always reasonable and sometimes a real bargain . We just stayed on a Monday night for $ 87 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is extremely well situated ; walking distance to great shops and restaurants . Clean , great staff and very nice rooms . The kids has some treats waiting for them in the room ( great detail ) and the room was very spacious and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great , staff was lovely . Food just in the middle nothing spectacular . Fair would be my overall rating of hotel and hotel food . Check ##ing in to the room dirty dishes lined the hallway . Had to call x ##2 to get hospitality to clear out the hallway . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have always been a fan of Kim ##pton hotels . In this case the Monaco features most of Kim ##pton services . The beds are very comfortable and the morning coffee service and afternoon wine service are a great plus . Location is quite good , within walking distance to most city landmarks . I missed slip ##pers offered in the rooms ; not even available through front - desk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff is amazing - when asked they offered great places to visit and eat . Property and rooms are very clean - sheets and towels were soft and the room was spacious . Ava ##ila ##bility of vehicle after v ##alet was short . . . will definitely recommend this hotel to others ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I hosted a small business group here for a few days and the staff was the best ! David the Door ##man , Dwight , Gene . . . . all of the bell , con ##cier ##ge and front desk staff were so helpful and kind . They were at ##ten ##tive and helped me move boxes , do room drops , etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The v ##alet service is expensive as you can imagine at that location but the staff were exceptionally nice and helpful . The hotel is ch ##ic and clean . Room was spacious though not designed too well ( sitting at desk is opposite direction of TV ) The bathroom ##s definitely need up ##dating for a 5 star hotel . I was in the hotel less than 12 hours total yet my door was knocked on 3 times for cleaning . If you know someone is checking out at noon , clean the room after they leave ! Location is a plus but my room ' s view was the side of the next building . I was hoping to see r ##I ##ver since it is located so close to it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is a great place to stay . Great location and great service . Food was great . It is my favorite place to stay . Everything is in a walking distance . Everyone is very helpful from the front door and everywhere else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice rooms , although not big . Light ##ing and mirrors not placed well for make up , etc . Stay ##ed during strike so there were expected laps in service . Service recovery after I asked about missing items not acceptable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Upon arrival , La ##ni ##ta greeted us with a welcoming smile . She accommodate ##d all of our needs and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was exceptional . The room was clean and spacious , and it had a beautiful view . We had a delight ##ful stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was great , the accommodation ##s were more than adequate . The location was on point . Close to the beach for a morning run . P ##lent ##y of restaurants in walking distance , then an evening s ##tro ##ll window shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really wanted to like this hotel , it ’ s downtown , easy walking to shops and restaurants . The hotel staff are helpful and overall just great . What ’ s not great very small bathroom ##s , W ##IF ##I isn ’ t free , no coffee maker in room and very noisy . If you like a good hair dry ##er , bring your own . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful stay . Lu ##x ##uri ##ous hotel without being pre ##ten ##ti ##ous . Co ##mb ##ination of comfort and style . The staff was court ##eous and available without being noticeable . Location can ' t be beat . Am ##eni ##ties are second to none . Can ' t wait to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This has to be the worst value for money I ' ve ever experienced at any hotel . This hotel is run down , with very old fashioned looking de ##cor and design . It is large with many guests and there is no personal touch to the service . I stayed there for two days , and my bedroom had not been made when I returned to the hotel around 6 pm , same for my friend ' s room . There was a huge line for check - out which took close to half an hour . At a rate of 400 USD / night you would expect more . Moreover , not even the gym entrance nor the w ##if ##i was included in that price , that was charged an additional cost . What a disappointment . I know the quality of Hilton hotels can vary , I should remember this for the future and simply not take the risk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great room , bed was a l ##il low but a good bed in general . Fr ##idge was a bit small but adequate , gym open 24 hours . Re ##quest ##ed a microwave , which I received , but it was not the best . Order ##ed " butler " room service because kitchen was closed , food was good . Internet worked well , would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were surprised at check in that our king room was not available . Book ##ed in January . Really disappointed . Now the Hotel really me ##dio ##cre for Hilton . I would look somewhere else unless this is the location you need to stay RB [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was great but booking site Can ##cel ##on charged us way more than the bill from the hotel . When I called to in ##quire they said that was there policy ##v ##to charge more for there services . Not sure what they were . I online searched and booked th ##ru another company but received confirmation from Can ##cel ##on . And of course there will be no re ##fu ##nd . Found out they have an F rating with B ##BB . But hotel was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] G ##ym was spectacular Great card ##io , free weights and machines They have several t ##read ##mill ##s , el ##liptic ##al , s ##tai ##rma ##ster Du ##mbe ##lls go up to 100 lbs There is a free weight bench as well as a s ##mith machine There ' s life fitness machines for every body part including ca ##lves The life ##fit ##ness station is amazing . It has a T ##R ##X , monkey bars and several pull ##ey stations Oscar was very pleasant and helpful [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was at Public for a business trip and would definitely come back should I have the opportunity to . The location is great , near bars , great restaurants , shopping , near the United Center , and the staff is very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Large Hotel in great location off W ##ack ##er and the River . Lo ##bby and facilities were nice . Room was spacious but the up ##hol ##ster ##y needed up ##dating . It was worn in many places . Not enough drawers for clothing . Room experienced a lot of elevator noise [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very convenient ##ly located hotel for shopping , dining and it is right by the E ##L so you can head to W ##rig ##ley or US Cell ##ular very convenient ##ly . The staff are incredibly friendly and pleasant . The rooms are spacious and well appointed . There is a te ##rri ##fic variety of food available at the breakfast b ##uff ##et but it does fill up . The only draw ##back as others have commented , are the slow elevators along with there being only 2 . That said , enjoy staying here and would recommend / stay again . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Such a nice hotel . Perfect location ! Nice lobby with bar . You must see the magician show at the hotel . Such a nice experience . Pretty close to a lot of tourist places . Walking distance . Well it depends if you like to walk . Which we do [SEP]
1	[CLS] We upgraded our room to include club access . S ##nac ##ks provided in evening time varied and were good . Had to pay for alcoholic drinks , reasonably priced and good . Need to improve on breakfast . Just basic continental stuff . Hampton is better on breakfast . Room - bed comfortable , larger room , good view from 23rd floor looking out to Navy Pier . Didn ' t go to pool so can ' t comment there . Staff all very nice . I liked being right on the river walk ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are looking for a small , intimate , friendly hotel in a great location , the Ki ##nz ##ir is for you . We loved the continental breakfast , which was set up on each floor every morning . The whole v ##ibe of the hotel was comfortable . The staff was outstanding and very willing to help with suggestions and directions . A special shout out to Alex , who texted me a few times to check on our stay and any needs that we may have had . High ##ly recommend the akin ##sie and we will definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My Son Sur ##prise ##d Me and My Wife for Our 24th Wedding Anniversary . We stayed over Night . Starting from Check In , the Staff was Warm & Friendly . The Door Man Perry , was Outstanding ! . . He Help ##ed Us with Park ##ing and Ba ##g ' s and knew everything about the Hotel . Our Room was Clean , Co ##zy , and very Spa ##cious it was not a Suite , but it felt like it . The Bed was Wonderful ##ly Co ##m ##fort ##able and We S ##le ##pt like Ba ##bies . We also had Dinner in the Hotel Restaurant which was very Good Food . And A shout Out to Our other Door man D ##wayne . He also was very knowledge ##able about Chicago and has no Problem taking Your Photo ' s if He ' s Standing there . We Had A Great Time ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone was so helpful and pleasant from check in , night desk staff , to house ##cle ##ani ##ng staff , to the very nice door ##man . To ##ns of fantastic restaurants within walking distance and only a 5 minute walk to Michigan Ave . Room was very spacious and clean , only down ##side was we had a room right next to the el ##vat ##or which itself was not an issue as we didn ' t hear it running at all but our room looked right into another guest room . It ' s just the design of the hotel and we understand not every room will have a great view . Was nothing that took away from our stay though . Would definitely stay again and recommend for others ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always try to stay in a different area of Chicago so thought we would try a bit further north than Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mike . Love ##d the neighborhood with local restaurants and great architecture like the Dr ##ie ##haus Museum . The staff was excellent , g ##rac ##ious and very helpful and very good , well - informed con ##cier ##ges . And the restaurant had excellent food . Only negative was longer waits for elevators but it is an older building so we just built in a few extra minutes . Room wise , the studio king was huge with nicely up ##hol ##stered sofa . Anyone with noise into ##ler ##ance may want to ask for 8th floor or higher by phone directly to the hotel in advance since there is new con ##do b ##ld ##g next door with huge H ##VA ##C exhaust ##s up to 7th floor . This is really a great value for the money ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the H ##ya ##tt Regency due to a meeting being held there . My room with king size bed was spacious ! ( I did not reserve my room ) It was close to shopping and the other attractions . I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Mar ##dan ##a was very at ##ten ##tive during our stay at the hotel and for our experience at the Gold Floor Restaurant . She was so pleasant dealing with us each morning , remembering our previous day ' s orders and overall made our time in the lounge comfortable . Ch ##eers ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at She ##rato ##n Grand once again . I have stayed here 5 times in the last year . It is a bit more price ##y then some of the other places around , but they have the best location , wonderful staff and always the most comfortable beds around ! I will AL ##WA ##Y ##S stay here when in town ! Thank you to the wonderful staff who make my visits so great ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Clean , well - located hotel in the heart of Chicago ' s Gold Coast . So many bars and restaurants in the area , and just blocks to the lake ##front . Good service , price was right , but only negative is that my room was a bit stark and " cold " feeling . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Help ##ful check in staff . Wonderful room . Clean , spacious . Good location . No complaints except check out I had some questions and the person was dismiss ##ive . Not representative of the people I typically interact ##ed with at the front desk . I have stayed there before and would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was originally built in the 20 ' s , and has a very cool ballroom and overall style of that age . It was the original Playboy hotel ( He ##ff lived next door in the Pa ##ll Mall building ) . The rooms are very updated , and the staff is friendly . Breakfast in the restaurant was fine , but pedestrian . The bathroom is small ##ish , but new and nicely appointed . My only grip ##e is the shower . I don ' t like the overhead " rainfall " shower head , and the way it ' s designed , I had to pretty much stand under it in order to turn on the shower . Cold start to the day ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I arrived in the lobby of the beautiful Kim ##pton All ##egro on a busy Saturday night looking for a group of friends . Immediately , Sandy Gallagher ( The Guest Experience Manager — what a great job title ! ) asked if I needed some help . She escorted me around to all the hidden little intimate al ##co ##ves of the lobby until I found my group . Wow ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chicago ’ s Best ! This is the property to stay at while in Chicago . Whether for business or pleasure no need to look elsewhere . The inter ##continent ##al is the best ! Great location . F ##abulous rooms / suites . Staff second to none . I ’ ve stayed in R ##itz Carlton ##s , Four Seasons and can ’ t go back after staying at the Intercontinental ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel lobby takes you back to the grand era of hotels . . . it is beautiful and the workers are very well trained with excellent customer service skills . In 2019 , this is pretty amazing . The rooms , however are a different story . the furniture is worn , none of the very limited electrical outlets in - bed ##ded in the lamps worked . . . had to un ##p ##lug the clock to power up my phone . . . . the shower head is so low that my 5 ' 10 frame had to stay hunched over . . . but what was most disappointing was the complete lack of a in room coffee maker . . At the end of the day , these issues are why i gave this a 3 rating and not a 4 . . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The CO ##NR ##AD offers outstanding quality , luxury , and style that provides both a great place to stay and also a great location to walk throughout the city . From the restaurant , to the room amenities , and location to River North , the stay offers access to all parts of Chicago . The rooms also have plenty of room if you are looking to stay in and the staff is willing to help in any way possible to make the stay perfect . A great place to stay anytime of the year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was nice and clean . Thing that really upset me was our room was not ready at guaranteed check in time of 3 p . m . we could not check in till almost 4 : 30 so we had to wait for an hour and a half . Kind of killed our plans a little bit and person at front desk was not very helpful they ended up taking off $ 14 . 95 from my bill . . . thanks for nothing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would highly recommend this hotel on Michigan Avenue in the heart of downtown Gold Coast . It is in a great hotel - I especially like the large suite rooms , perfect location , clean ##liness , and caring staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check - in reception ##ist was not pleasant . Did not offer the luggage hold services when my room was not ready . Restaurant ##s were over ##crow ##ded . One restaurant was open seating ( once they let you in the door ) and then you had to fight for a seat among the already over ##crow ##ded people waiting at the bar . The food was also me ##dio ##cre . The other restaurant took over 30 minutes ( after I was seated ) to bring me water or even acknowledge I was there ( this was after I tried to grab someone and then finally grabbed someone that typically did not serve the section I was in ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel stuff is welcoming and caring , the service is good , the rooms are small and relatively old . The shower is really small . The furniture is old yet the bed is comfortable . They do offer a happy hour with some sparkling wine to cheer up the guests in the afternoon . I think that the Kim ##pton Grey is better and not far . The lobby and common facilities are nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect for visiting the Chicago downtown venues . We walked to the museums in mill ##ennial park and found everything to be easy access . Park ##ing at the hotel was easy and after getting your ticket verified with a hotel you could go in and out of the parking garage as many times as you wanted [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has been nicely updated . The staff was very friendly , helping us out with directions and suggestions of where to go eat . We were even able to check in early , although we had to take a king size bed instead of the doubles that I booked . Not a big deal . There is a modern , trend ##y bar in the hotel , although we did not get a chance to visit it . In the basement , there are hundreds of photographs of celebrities , athletes , & musicians that have grace ##d the P ##ump Room throughout the years . It was a pretty cool hidden treasure to discover . I would definitely stay here again , [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just want to say thank you to the staff in the Gold Lounge . Both Mu ##gi and Mu ##rano were exceptional in the level of service they provided . Their attention to detail was what made our stay memorable . Thank you [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited Chicago Illinois for the 1st time and we were nervous , our 1st experience with our children and we wanted it to be great worrying about our hotel experience was one problem we hoped would not be an issue and it wasn ' t . Thanks Si ##me ##on and Allen for taking very good care of us making sure our room had a refrigerator making sure our bill was accurate . We were very pleased with this hotel the location was great the view was amazing of the city and we plan to stay here again . Thank You guys for helping us feel relaxed and welcome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location with respect to magnificent mile , shopping an restaurants - staff were very friendly and helpful - 3rd stay at Talbot ##t and would definitely stay again - great breakfast on the street side patio - overall excellent bout ##ique hotel [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can ’ t say enough great things about my stay at Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco Chicago ! The hotel is cute , co ##zy , and ch ##ic . I loved the de ##cor , the entire hotel has a beautiful est ##hetic . The staff was very friendly and the hotel was very clean . The best part about the hotel is its convenient location . It is located right on the River ##walk and is walk ##able to Downtown Chicago ' s famous sights . We also had an amazing city view from our room . I ' ll definitely be recommend ##ing Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco Chicago to all my family and friends , and I can ' t wait to visit again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every train line meets down the block from this hotel . It ' s close to lots of tourist destinations and everything is updated . The rooms are small - if we had brought the baby and the play ##pen , it would have been tight . That said , the staff was friendly , the restaurant breakfast was excellent ( not included ) and we appreciated the flavor ##ed water in the lobby . I stayed at another Kim ##pton in Savannah , GA and would look for this chain again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an awesome experience and the customer service level is beyond expectations . Caroline at check in & out was awesome . . she had a cab prepared for us although we didn ##t need it . Great conversations . The front desk was awesome and the housekeeper who cleaned our room Saturday night was great ! Although we didn ##t interact in person , we interact ##ed through notes ! . The restaurant had great food and the staff was super friendly and at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was comfortable and friendly , but they took $ $ $ out of my bank account after telling me that the card was ON ##L ##Y for incident ##als . They offered no compensation , and I had no access to the $ $ for about a week . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ing , to say the least . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We arrived in town on a Sa ##t night . With a reservation that had been made for months . The entire hotel was shut down . We felt like they had had plenty of time to not ##ify us . It was easy enough to change but thank goodness I was a sa ##v ##vy travel ##er . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 2 weeks during an internship . The staff were kind and friendly . Lo ##bby needs updated , but the rooms and service were great . Con ##cier ##ge were always extremely helpful . Be sure to visit Joe ' s Ju ##ice next door . Great location to the Gold Coast area . Re ##com ##men ##d the WA ##LT ##ON ON THE PA ##R ##K for parking . Bar ##ely a block away . Reserve on Spot Hero app . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed for business , for 3 rooms . We all had " Deluxe " rooms . Upon arrival one person had to be relocated as the hotel gave up their room before we arrived . When I checked into my room the conditions were disgusting . St ##ain ##s on the furniture , dust all over the walls and floor ##boards , stained towels , everything in room looked run down , broken lamp shade . . . . I immediately reported it to the management but they offered to relocate me to a room on the same floor . That would have been a waste of my time because my fellow Travel ##ers had rooms just as bad on the same floor . Management ended up giving me a credit to use in the restaurant but quite frankly staying in the hotel for five nights with one of the most uncomfortable experiences I ' ve ever had while traveling . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I just completed a fantastic stay at the Intercontinental Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile Chicago . My goodness this was the kind ##est most at ##ten ##tive staff has experienced in a while . This includes front desk house ##keeping and the folks in the restaurants ! The hotel is situated in a great part of town close to everything exciting … And I love the c ##itrus f ##rag ##rance toilet ##ries [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had no problems with our stay . G ##RE ##AT location on the river within close walking distance to S ##O many places and restaurants ! We had to be switched rooms because of some maintenance that was scheduled and we were in our new room within only 5 minutes ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is really considered the best hotel in world , excellent trained and professional staff specially front desk manager Mr . Eric and his team W ##ahi ##d and J ##ass ##en , and the con ##cier ##ge Suzanne . Many thanks to them for their extra ordinary work P ##L ##US , the excellent service with the nice hotel location and view [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very nice hotel near Rush Street . The staff was nice and friendly even though we booked th ##ru a 3rd party website . I ask for a view of the Hancock Tower and they gave me the perfect room , 161 ##0 , so I could see it every day . Sleeping in the bed was like sleeping on a cloud . Very soft . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel ! The staff was friendly and even gave us free bottle ##d water at check in ! The hotel is very clean and our rooms were very nice and quiet ! The gift shop had a nice selection of post ##cards and stamps on hand ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was in walking distance to shopping and restaurants . And a quick L ##y ##ft ride to the museums . We enjoyed the hot breakfast with a good selection and evening social hour . I appreciated the kitchen so we didn ’ t need to eat every meal out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gorge ##ous rooms and great added amenities ! ! We had a fl ##aw ##less check - in by Melissa . Had some great food in the double cross during the happy hour and a great breakfast selection available on every floor was awesome ! Very clean room , hope to be back soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wanted to share " Chicago " with the kids while we were there for a rowing event in Lincoln Park . Great historic hotel . Look ##ed at all of the typical chains and decided that we wanted to have a Chicago experience . The staff is really fantastic , from Door to Dinner ! K ##wa ##me really goes above and beyond for his guests ! Some problems with the hotel throughout our stay , given the age of the hotel , it wasn ' t terribly surprising . Thankfully we were on the 4th floor and able to use the stairs pretty easily . Room ##s were spacious . The staff that made up our room was un ##im ##pressive . Would stay there again . Location was great and the staff made it comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot Hotel provided friendly , helpful service with beautiful accommodation ##s . Location was convenient and close enough to walk to shopping , restaurants and bars . Everything about our experience from reservations , check in / out con ##ce ##ier ##ge services and the ultra helpful door ##man , Darrell , was amazing . [SEP]
0	[CLS] To get a great night sleep I need 2 things : a comfortable bed and the right temperature . The Hilton Chicago has comfortable beds in clean well equipped and laid out rooms , but poor temperature control means only a marginal sleep . This hotel is steep ##ed with history , in an excellent area and has excellent amenities such as an outstanding gym . I ’ m personally not interested in social status based on the “ importance ” of a hotel or which famous people have stayed there . For me a quality sleep is priority and the Hilton comes up short . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 2 nights . Good location , helpful staff . We didn ' t eat in the hotel so can ' t comment . The rooms were large and well equipped , if a little dark . The fitness centre was OK for a hotel of this size . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is beautiful and very Art Dec ##o . The hallway ##s reminded me of the shining and I seriously was afraid of seeing the twins saying red ##rum ! Bed was amazing ##ly comfortable . Overall I don ’ t like walls being black , and the v ##ibe was weird . No free water in the room . The elevators were awful and three were down to one for one day . It was a complete frustration . Overall , it was clean and comfortable - I just don ’ t care for the dark de ##cor in the rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay , it was a quick 4 day visit . Close to everything , friendly staff , nice hotel , food was price ##y but good . We were next to the staff elevator so I was worried about noise but didn ’ t hear a thing ! For the price per night they should offer free W ##i ##F ##i . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great experience here ! Everyone who worked there was wonderful and went above and beyond to help with anything and everything ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend place to stay ! The rooms were very clean , great views from the window seats and they even gave my kids a gold fish to have a pet while in the room for the night : ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed here for two nights this past weekend . I highly recommend this hotel for it ’ s convenience , comfort , economy and fantastic location ! It is also ups ##cale and elegant ! I ’ d also like to recognize a special house ##keeping employee , Sc ##ip ##ien Sam ##ba , for her friendly service and detailed attention when cleaning my room and for finding my lost jewelry bag and leaving it for me on the bed with a note ! I greatly appreciate her honesty and integrity , and I look forward to staying here when I ’ m in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love staying at Swiss ##ote ##l when in Chicago . The rooms are large , with com ##fy beds , good works ##pace , great views of the city . The staff are very re ##sp ##ons ##ive to requests . The exercise room is on the 42nd floor with a view of the lake . A big shout out to Ke ##enan for his excellent customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband booked us a room here for a weekend trip . We ' ve stayed in a lot of hotels in Chicago and this was probably one of the best ones so far . We had a corner room on the 10th floor with a beautiful view . The room was large , with a very comfortable bed and window seating area . We loved having the ne ##sp ##ress ##o machine in the room for our use as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a very nice hotel that was in a great location to enjoy the river walk , Michigan Ave . , Navy Pier an more . We have a room with a gorgeous view of the lake and Navy Pier ( which was just a short walk away ) . The pool was busy when we were there so we didn ' t swim but did enjoy the sun deck . It was small but nice . They gym was big and well equipped including details like water cooler and cold towels for post work ##out cool off . The lobby and rooms were pretty standard but nice and clean . Service was good . El ##eva ##tors were quick and we never had to wait . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a charming bout ##ique hotel ! ! So inviting to see the fireplace and furniture placed just perfectly in the lobby . The area surrounding of the hotel is so grand with many beautiful old style brick homes . The hotel management was wonderful and very helpful with shuttle services and other information . Love ##d it ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 3 nights and loved the location . Close to parks , subway & bus stops . Star ##bu ##cks and restaurants on site . Only complaint was no mini fridge in room so you have to call to have them bring one up - Which did come up promptly ! You can walk around and see the history of one of the oldest hotels in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a last minute change in my sleeping accommodation last night and Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago , especially Nicole T . , was S ##UP ##ER friendly and helpful ! T ##ruly ex ##em ##p ##lar customer service all around ! Thank you ! I ' ve never heard of Swiss ##ote ##l until yesterday and I gotta say I ##m impressed ! I ' ll be keeping an eye out for other locations in the future ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We held our 30 year Army reunion here in Chicago and got a group rate at The Ki ##nz ##ie . We could not have been more pleased with the location , accommodation ##s , amenities , and service . I highly recommend The Ki ##nz ##ie ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sir ##ens , drums , bull horns , Strike ##rs tried to disrupt guests . . It worked . $ 400 + a night due to the I ##MT ##S 2018 trade show . I really wanted a good night sleep . Bed was clean and soft . Room was average , but clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand in Chicago is the perfect place to set - up shop in the heart of the city . A short walk in any direction gets you to local restaurants , shopping , and tourist locations and the hotel also offers a nice river walk area with a b ##urger joint . The rooms were average sized but very clean and the staff was considerably helpful with any questions that I had . There is a Fed ##E ##x office within the hotel which was helpful for my business trip and the bar was large enough to service the groups we had on site . St ##eer clear of Columbus Drive on the south side of the river because the underground has become a makeshift hotel to Chicago ' s less - fortunate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In spite of having to change rooms 3 times I enjoyed my recent stay . I booked a king bed and was given a small queen room at check ##in . I them was moved to a king room however it was clear that someone had smoked heavily in this room . Finally I was moved to a third room and it was very nice . The bed was very comfortable . The bath is the smallest of any hotel I have ever stayed in . The bath is similar in size to one you would find on a cruise ship It ' s located in the theater district and very easy to get around the city . I would highly recommend confirming the room type you are being given at check ##in along with asking if the room has been smoked in [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a truly unique , caring , inviting , comfortable and clean hotel . Vale ##t parking , after a long drive from Connecticut and got to enjoy wine social [UNK] . High ##ly recommend this lovely hotel . It would be my first choice for a hotel no doubt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not so impressed Is ##ent she ##rato ##n sur ##posed to be ups ##cale ? This hotel is not Look dated , staff is not switched on , have to buy for w ##if ##i Breakfast was costly and boring ( buffer ##t ) Will i stay there again ? , no [SEP]
0	[CLS] An o ##asis of calm amid the Downtown Chicago buzz . A perfect location for visiting the city with top notch customer service . Thank ##yo ##u Chris for all your great info and personal assistance . This was our second stay at the Talbot ##t and it ’ s the extra mile customer service along with great value that keeps us coming back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love everything about the Chicago So ##fit ##el . I ' ve stayed there multiple times . The location is amazing - - close to the high - end shopping on North Michigan Ave . , but with a little quiet ##er neighborhood v ##ibe . The staff is professional and friendly and helpful , the hotel is modern and luxurious , with beautifully appointed rooms , comfortable beds and beautiful views of the city , and their restaurant serves a lovely European - style breakfast . It feels like a little bit of Paris in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I checked into a room with a nice view of the river . The room was clean and the bed was comfortable . The hotel is within close proximity to the main shopping area so you can convenient ##ly walk there . There is a huge supermarket close by if you exit from the back entrance of the hotel . The room itself had an umbrella provided for guest use during my stay there and that proved really useful as it was pouring when I needed to go out . My only g ##rouse is that even though there were 6 elevators , every time I needed to use it , only 2 ( “ D ” and “ E ” ) of the 6 seemed to be working for access to my floor . As the elevators were a little small , there were a few times when I had to wait for the next one because they were already full when the elevator reached my room floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay . Easy access to downtown attractions and shopping on Mill ##eni ##um Mile . Room was clean and staff was very helpful . Quick check - in and check - out . Will definitely stay at this hotel in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and service ! Stay ##ed there via an exclusive Travel ##zo ##o deal . If you don ’ t use house ##keeping services you get a food / drink credit . Nice rooms and nice views . Will definitely consider staying there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this through A ##go ##da for a birthday trip and I was not disappointed . Great location , clean and bright facility , and the staff was the best I have ever had . Spencer was so helpful ( even brought me my laptop that I left in the lobby ) and Der ##ick made sure we knew where we were going as we left . First time I ’ ve stayed in downtown Chicago and was not irritated with sire ##ns and noise — this location was quiet and se ##rine . The bed was comfortable and the dual shower heads had everyone taking nice long shower ##s . My husband loved having Netflix in the TV and the W ##IF ##I was great ! It was also nice to be able to text for directions or with basic questions and the replies were quick to each of my questions . Thank you Ki ##nz ##ie — we will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , wonderful staff in every department . Nice ##ly appointed rooms very comfortable . Lots of areas to sit and meet with colleagues outside of our conference . En ##joy ##ed the restaurants and the meeting spaces were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was one of the best hotels I ' ve stayed at . The room was beautiful with a river view and two window seats where my 15 year old spent a lot of his time . We had two queen ##s which worked well for our family of four . The room was quiet and the shower was amazing - - hot with lots of water pressure . The room was cleaned daily in a very time ##ly manner . We walked everywhere from the hotel and also used the el , which was really convenient to the location . Really the only down ##side in my mind was having to look out at the Trump sign across the river , but that ' s not the Monaco ' s fault ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about my stay was amazing , from start to finish . Hospital ##ity is at its peak at the She ##rato ##n Grand ; every member of the staff is more than willing to go above and beyond to accommodate their guests . Special shout ##out to Manager Eric Ball ##en for making the experience sea ##m ##less and enjoyable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My girlfriend and I had a great time at the Ambassador hotel . We have already booked our next trip there . It ’ s a great a value and very very special . Service is top notch , very clean and super location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We selected The Talbot ##t because they are one of the few pet friendly hotels in the area , and it was a great decision . The location is absolutely great . 2 minute walk to Rush Street and to the great restaurants , 15 ##min walk to the river , down the street from the Hancock tower . Staff was always smiling , and were very friendly . Talbot ##t will be our first choice of hotel from here on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love having all the space that the one bedroom suite provides . Having a kitchen is also nice with having 2 young kids . We enjoyed the city views and the kids loved the pool . Extra bonus was it was actually nice and warm ! Also like how the coffee is available all day in the lobby . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall I love the Hilton chain . I always stay at this particular Hilton every time I am in Chicago . My room was perfectly located . I had an awesome view of the water and overall downtown . Do ##y Gil ##dar ##t was a great help ! I never buy these vacation packages and he old it to me without being overwhelming ! Easy to talk to and got the job done fast . I cannot wait until my trip to Vegas . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was basic but price ##y , with no microwave or fridge . The heat would only blow 72 degrees and it was a very cold night . Fu ##rn ##iture could also be updated . Pi ##llow ##s were very plus ##h and they have great mirrors all around the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed in other Swiss ##ote ##l hotels in Latin America ( Q ##uit ##o and L ##I ##ma ) , so I was not disappointed with the great hotel in Chicago , their nice and at ##ten ##tive staff and the wonderful rooms , with views towards the river and or the lake . The location makes it very easy to get into the Big Bus or the River ##walk or other river boat tours , and is within walking distance of Mill ##eni ##um Park and other attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is beat ##iful and has great views of the city . The service was okay . I would have like some in ##fused water and snack options . The room ##I ##s neutral ##ly decorated . The rooms have a coffee make and fridge but no microwave . I also never found the ice di ##spense ##r . The bed was comfortable but I heard everything outside my window despite being on the sixteenth floor . There are many food and entertainment options downtown around this hotel , yet it ’ s pretty secure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very ups ##cale hotel . Good food and service at both restaurants . Book ##ed this hotel because of rooms with 2 queen size beds . The beds were not queen size and customer service representative only said they were and was not going to do anything to change our room . So be ##ware of what is stated on their website when it comes to room / bed types . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Long weekend with my husband and two children for our first trip to Chicago for a short vacation . Really wonderful breakfast and staff ! Clean rooms and great location . Don ' t hesitate , just book . You won ' t be sorry ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an excellent time at the hotel . The location is very well suited to get you to the most important neighborhoods in Chicago easily . Park ##ing is p ##lent ##iful nearby and the our room ( we were upgraded to a junior suite ) was incredibly large and very nice . The staff really set this location apart though . They are all incredibly friendly and helpful from the front desk , to the bar , to luggage and v ##alet . A special shout to D ##wayne who was incredibly helpful and friendly getting us checked in and packed up when leaving . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my 2nd visit to this hotel . The staff keeps everything on point despite the large amount of traffic ##s in the lobby with the conference going on . The room and the view are great . I would be re ##mis ##s if I did not state this is a luxury hotel and prices reflect that . [SEP]
0	[CLS] After staying at a disappointing hotel booked for my conference last year , we vowed to find a hotel in magnificent mile that gave us the best Chicago experience , and the So ##fit ##el definitely delivered . From the warm welcome by the staff to the absolutely incredible views , to the turn ##down service and meals at both c ##da and le bar , there wasn ’ t a single aspect of our stay that wasn ’ t executed perfectly . I have never stayed at this particular chain before , but my experience was on par with stays at five star hotels . From now on , So ##fit ##el is going to be at the top of my list when staying in Chicago or any new city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great value . Very clean and comfortable rooms . Close to major attractions in downtown Chicago . The hallway ##s and lobby areas can be updated to match room renovations . Staff were professional and very helpful . I would definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Due to delayed flights from winter storm weather in Beautiful and Cold Chicago , I was able to spend a few extra days at Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park . Thankfully , the staff at the Fair ##mont made this delay thoroughly relaxing . The best part of my stay , was the staff at THE BA ##R , the bar / lounge of the Fair ##mont . My bartender and so ##mme ##lier , Ser ##or , was not only friendly and at ##ten ##tive , he was extremely knowledge ##able and a great conversation ##alis ##t , while still tend ##ing to all of his guests perfectly . Working alongside him was Regina , an equally lovely and at ##ten ##tive server . Great experience ! Looking forward to my next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here 3 years ago . The rooms have since been updated . Gone is the ta ##cky , floral - print wall paper and Victorian furnishings . It was a nice experience . The food in the restaurant was good . I was given two complementary passes to the breakfast b ##uff ##et because my room was not ready when I arrived ( I had to wait about 5 minutes - not a big deal to me , but the manager was frantic and a ##pol ##og ##etic ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Good : Location , location , location . You just can ' t beat the E . Grand location , right near everything important in downtown Chicago . Excellent room ( get a corner one ) with great views , taste ##ful de ##cor , kitchen ##ette . Free dinner and breakfast . The Bad : Re ##lent ##lessly geared for families only . Breakfast is fine ( the kids are still asleep ) but the cocktail hour is a zoo of r ##au ##co ##us , bust ##ling kids grabbing no ##od ##le ca ##sser ##ole etc . There is little to attract a business travel ##er in the cocktail hour - poor drinks ( Bud Light or bad wine ) , absolutely nothing in the way of cocktail fare : na ##ry a nut , pre ##tz ##el , chip , ve ##gg ##ie , app ##eti ##zer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . Lots of places to walk to , staff very helpful and friendly . Only negative was the parking which is very over ##p ##rice ##d and should ' ve been stated when booking so I could ' ve made alternate arrangements ahead of time . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Home ##wood Suite ##s in Chicago , was very comfortable , clean and walking distance to great restaurants and several tourist attractions . The staff was extremely friendly and helpful . Breakfast was g ##rat ##is and very good with a lot of variety in selection . Our Suite was clean and room ##y . Very good accommodation ##s at a very reasonable price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My parents came to this hotel in August because I was having a family reunion at home and it was too small to accommodate them , I would like to thank the staff for their kindness and for having met the expectations of my parents , they loved their stay with you , beautiful room with all the comfort they needed , excellent breakfast , thank you [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just steps from Michigan a ##ve . This is a very nice suite hotel . One king bed in bedroom . So ##fa couch in living room . Perfect for s ##nor ##ing couples . T ##v ’ s in each room . Small kitchen with refrigerator and microwave . Also coffee pot . We were on the 29th floor . The views were amazing . The room was clean and co ##zy . Free breakfast every morning . We stayed on a Saturday night so could not take advantage of their Monday through Thursday afternoon cocktail ##s and snack ##s , which I ’ m told is also compliment ##ary . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a concert at the United Center . Beautiful hotel ! Very clean and friendly staff . De ##fin ##ite ##ly get the feel of being in an ups ##cale hotel with a vintage flare . High ##ly recommend ! The rooms are on the smaller side but I didn ' t feel as if we needed anything bigger . If you are wanting to put a roll ##away or c ##ri ##b in the room I suggest booking a queen bed room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well appointed hotel with an excellent location the Loop / Theatre district area . Within walking distance of many Chicago landmarks and even close to the West Loop . Would stay there again on a future trip to Chicago . The only knock are the small bathroom ##s inside the sleeping rooms - - however , that ' s not uncommon with downtown hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is good in that the rooms were clean and well decorated . It ' s a perfect location for exploring the wonderful city of Chicago . There are some down ##side ##s - the reception staff were really un ##friend ##ly - bordering on rude . They also charge for w ##if ##i - which I was aware of . It ' s $ 10 . 95 for 24 hours although free in the lobby . However I was amazed and horrified to be charged $ 67 for v ##alet parking . It ' s an outrage ##ous price and I ' m cross with myself for not checking the website for the cost before I asked the v ##alet to park my car ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My Aunt ##ie came to visit Chicago for the first time and we were very impress by the hotel location and the am ##eni ##ty that was offer and views and great shopping location . Everything was in walking distance to sights ##ee ##ing , touring [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel with spacious well appointed rooms . Well located along the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and within easy walking distance of typical tourist attractions including the architectural boat tours , Millennium Park , the Art Institute , Navy Pier and others . Breakfast was quite good but a bit steep in price if you add any extra ##s . Friendly staff and con ##cier ##ge Jason was very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My boyfriend and I stayed at this wonderful hotel over Christmas and were so pleased with our experience . The staff was enthusiastic , helpful , and well - informed . Our room had a wonderful window seat with a view of the river ! The bed was plus ##h and the rooms very quiet ! We will definitely return to this charming hotel and highly recommend it to other travelers ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this hotel . Quiet area and rooms , the room itself is q ##ua ##int . The selection of in room amenities is very impressive . Is also appreciate their commitment to e ##co friendly processes . I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has beautiful views , great location to walking anywhere in Chicago and the room was f ##abulous . Most comfortable bed ever - we had the ultra King room . Room was clean , super new and modern , great closet and a big flat screen t ##v , beautiful large ceiling to floor windows with electric curtains , shades . The lighting in the hotel room was really cool - lots of options . Beautiful marble bath - great shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Man ##dal ##a and Mu ##gi where amazing hosts at the Lounge . Really made our stay special ! We were there for a conference and also thought the lunch / dinner catering food and service were excellent . Overall staff was why I gave the hotel 4 stars . Hotel itself is well located but somewhat over ##p ##rice ##d considering nothing is included . . . couldn ’ t believe that you have to pay $ 8 bucks for a bottle of water ! A good coffee machine in the rooms just seems basic to me at this price range ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter was thrilled when she was surprised on the day of her birthday with the American Girl Doll experience . She was so happy to receive an AG travel bed , milk and cookies . To see her smile and watch her jump up and down made every penny worth the stay . Thank you to the staff for helping coordinate her surprise . You made her 9th birthday a great day ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The attention to detail coupled with the customer service makes this a f ##abulous experience ! The staff is superior , the late afternoon lemon ##ade and ta ##sty past ##ries were perfect on a hot Summer day . The pool and gym facilities were spot ##less . Room service was very quick and wonderful . The bed ##ding in my room was delicious and made it hard to get out of bed . O ##m ##ni Hotels never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location , very convenient , comfortable bed . The staff there are very friendly and helpful , I enjoy my stay there . But a few more to say , the room is small , the refrigerator cannot be used to store your food , the app ##liance is a bit old in the room and the internet is not free , which is kind of unpleasant experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We couldn ' t have asked for a better location for our time in Chicago . The hotel is in a great position just off the Ma ##g Mile and within easy walking distance of pretty much all the " must dos " in the city plus excellent public transport access . The room was spacious and comfortable and had everything we needed for our three night stay . Couldn ' t ask for more . Would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a room ##y comfortable hotel in central Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the perfect location if you want to be in the middle of the shopping hub . Hotel is a bit dated and could use some fresh ##ening but otherwise is a nice hotel . Will definitely stay again just for the location . One issue we had was our room was not ready when we arrived . Front desk told us they would call us when it was ready . . . . they never did . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' d like to thank you for a great stay this weekend . We booked 3 rooms with gold room access . They were able to accommodate my request for 3 rooms together and we also got lake views . This enabled us to watch fireworks from our room . Access to the gold room lounge was made even better by the excellent service provided by Pat ##ric ##io . Thanks for taking such great care of all the members of our family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Make sure you are charge for is the same as your reservation on your confirmation . I had this happen and they said it was a g ##lit ##ch in the computer . So how many g ##lit ##ches did this happen too ! ! ! Please check and bring a copy of your confirmation with you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was clean and nicely decorated . the bed was very con ##fort ##able . the location was perfect and we could walk everywhere . we ate breakfast in the on - site restaurant and it was amazing food . We would definitely return . Our only issue was they charged our Visa for our room that was already pre - paid . I called the next day and the issue was promptly taken care of . staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you would like luxury at an affordable rate this is the place for you Staff is great , amenities are great . Food was great , overall the hotel is an awesome place to stay for business or pleasure . Next time your in Chicago this is the place to stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great location next to shops , and other luxury hotels . Hotel was clean and the lobby bar service was excellent . Bart ##ender ##s were friendly and had a wealth of knowledge of the down town area . Would certainly visit again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Easy access to city amenities such as mi ##ric ##le mile and the Navy Pier . Close walking distance to the area or just take a cab or u ##ber . View ##s from the hotel were amazing with choice of views over the river and city or views over the lake [SEP]
1	[CLS] I don ' t usually rate hotels , but an exceptional stay deserves credit . We had a King room on the 13th floor which was huge by Chicago standards and beautifully appointed . When house ##keeping was running behind , Ana at front of house provided exceptional service and sent us over to Baptiste for compliment ##ary drinks while we waited for our bags to be sent up to our room . And those drinks . . . Amir is a top rate crafts ##man whom we will see out again for a Tipperary or two . Not to be missed . Our only disappointment was the short length of our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel does not have its own business center . Instead , you are sent to the basement on the pre ##tens ##e of it being the hotel ' s business center but instead it is an third party company which charges US ##UR ##IO ##US rates for basic functions - $ 3 / page to SC ##AN a document ; $ 7 to receive a Fed Ex envelope ( that only cost $ 10 to transport across the entire country . . . ) The list goes on . If you need access to a business center , this is NO ##T the hotel for you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a Kim ##pton Inner Circle member and this hotel is by far the worst Kim ##pton I ' ve been to . I normally stay at the Hotel Gray down the street - it is an amazing Kim ##pton where they treat you right . Unfortunately , the same is not the case for this Kim ##pton . The staff is rude and didn ' t even acknowledge my status and Kim ##pton loyalty . The hotel is under construction - which they don ' t tell you before ##hand or at check - in . Your only notice is a printed letter left near the bed with EA ##R P ##L ##U ##GS . Even if you wanted to use these , it would not drown out all the noise . Additionally , the theater below has massive neon lights that will shine into your room all night . The one good thing about the rooms is they are very clean . A ##vo ##id this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is on a perfect location it ' s its walking distance to everywhere on downtown ch ##ica ##go . the staff are very professional with great attitude . the hotel is beautiful the room clean and comfortable [SEP]
0	[CLS] When I travel to Chicago the kn ##icker ##bo ##cker is al ##way my first choice to stay ! Great great ##s , great staff and clean rooms along with being in a great location ! I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two days at the hotel in late June visiting friends from Chicago and friends coming in from Europe and Florida for a ' gathering ' . Hotel accommodation was great . Con ##cier ##ge services from Kathy were f ##abulous . Got us into places that said to me they were booked and handled it like a pro ! ! ! ! Thanks Kathy for looking after us ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed three nights there at the newer tower . After the first night sleeping in bed , I felt so it ##chy over my body . . and the room is kind of dusty with a big spider outside our window ! Y ##U ##K ##K ##K ! Won ’ t be back again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two days at this hotel and found that the staff was very helpful . The location was very convenient Room ##s were clean . Only slight complaint is you can hear your neighbor when he / she is taking a shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Even though there was an issue with the key card machine , they more than made us comfortable . I mean it was a technology fail , not their fault . The machine was up and running in no time at all . They also compliment ##ed us with a suite for the in ##con ##ven ##ience . The suite is nice , clean , and co ##zy . The J ##ac ##uz ##zi was wonderful ! We Will be back for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So glad we chose this hotel for our stay in Chicago . Beautiful lobby and the con ##cier ##ge was super helpful . We could walk everywhere . The hotel is historic so the rooms are small , but worked perfectly for our family of 3 . We ' d definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we had a charity event , birthday party weekend . We live on the North ##shore , so we spent the weekend at the Public Hotel , what a treat . Great location , warm , and friendly . Book it soon . City has so much . We planned another visit upon check out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful time here . Everyone was so nice and helpful . They helped us book a boat tour and navigate some of our trip . The park and play rate was perfect for us . We parked and took u ##ber the rest of the time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a series of family events . The facilities were excellent . The staff was very helpful . The location off Michigan Avenue made it easy to get to the various spots we were visiting , some within walking distance , including Lake Michigan . Of course there are many dining options in the area . The price also makes it our go - to place when we stay in Chicago compared to other Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely hotel . Located perfectly , could ’ ve gone with the Lang ##ham but chose here instead . Very helpful front desk and con ##cier ##ge . The only down ##side being the sound ##proof ##ing of the room . Could ’ ve paid for an upgrade if we knew the room next door was party ##ing at night [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my " go to " hotel when visiting Chicago . It ' s easy to get in and out of - it ' s the perfect location . The rooms are well appointed and comfortable . We opted to add on the gold status which gave us access to the lounge - well worth it ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently attended a business meeting at Hotel All ##egro and was very pleased with my stay . Right in the heart of the theater district , the hotel retains its Art Dec ##o de ##cor throughout . The lobby is beautiful and has a lot of private areas off the lobby where people can have quiet conversations or just get away and relax . You can get beverages in the lobby and breakfast in the adjoining 312 Chicago restaurant . Check in was a breeze and the staff was very helpful . My room was a little on the small size as was the bath , but overall my room was very good . My bed was comfortable and I loved the TV . Our meeting room was very good and we had a wonderful lunch brought in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent the Labor Day Weekend in Chicago at the H ##ya ##tt Regency and was very impressed the the facility , staff and v ##oc ##ation . The bed was very good and slept so well I was well rested for the next day of activities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone and ever ##thing was great ( i . e . friendly and happy people , clean rooms , comfortable bed , and great service ) . The only thing that was not perfect was the fitness center - - it was small for the size of hotel . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in a small suite last week . Dec ##or and furniture from the 80s ; had to let the water run for 10 minutes to get it hot enough to shower and the room heat ##ers were inconsistent . This is a huge , imp ##erson ##al , and very dated hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would not recommend this hotel . When I checked in it took the front desk person forever to check me in , despite the fact that my credit card and information was already on file . Upon check out I never re ##cie ##ved my bill and when I checked my email ( where it was supposed to be sent ) It was not there . When I tried to call the front desk I got a recording saying that I had to request a copy of the bill via the H ##ya ##tt main website . I have done this and 2 days later have still not re ##cie ##ved it . I need to submit this to my company for re ##im ##bur ##se ##ment . If you are a business travel ##er and like a has ##sle free hotel experience , I suggest you avoid this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I traveled to the Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago for a conference , I was pleasant ##ly surprised by my beautiful corner room that felt more like a suite . The bathroom was spot ##less , the bed was very comfortable and the location in the city could not have been better . My one and only complaint , the terrible elevator system . There are 6 elevators in total but at any given time only 2 were in service . Over the course of my 4 day / 3 night stay I ended up taking the stairs 4 different times - since I was on the 11th floor the trips down were much better than the trips up . Many people at the conference alerted the front desk staff to the long wait times , but the issue wasn ' t addressed . Would I stay here again ? Yes . Would I ask for a lower level room ? Yes . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very pleased to stay at this hotel on our first trip to Chicago . It is near great shopping , sites of interest and wonderful restaurants . You get great value for your money . All rooms are suites and are well appointed . It ’ s hard to find a bed that we find truly comfortable but we were delighted with the bed comfort in our room . Not sure if all rooms have this feature , but we had windows that offered views in several directions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for one night while in town for business and absolutely loved it . The staff was great - they even will text you after check - in to make sure everything is okay . The room was spacious and decorated really well ; I used the gym once and it was clean and modern , especially compared to a lot of other bout ##ique hotels I ' ve stayed at . I also love that they have a yoga mat in every room - it would be a bonus if they also provided yoga mat wipe ##s because I was a little nervous about when / if the yoga mat had last been s ##ter ##ilized , but it was still a great am ##eni ##ty to have . Also , I didn ' t travel with my pets - but I love that the Hotel Monaco is so pet - friendly , as a dog owner I really appreciate that and if / when I do travel with my pets , I ' ll be sure to come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When suburban ladies come to the big city , we look for comfort , safety and proximity to what we want to do . The O ##m ##ni fulfilled all of these ad ##mir ##ably . The suite was a nice size for three ( and reasonably priced , comparatively speaking ) . The location . within view of the Water Tower , couldn ' t be beat . And the three of us walking around late at night felt safe ( especially when there were couples pushing s ##tro ##llers down the sidewalk ##s at the same time ) . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My recent visit to Hilton Chicago was outstanding . The character of this historic hotel is gorgeous , but more than that , the hotel staff was helpful , knowledge ##able and truly superb . I had the pleasure of working with Wilson O ##ls ##rud from the Hilton V ##aca ##tion desk on a future trip to a Hilton in the next 18 months . He was clear , honest and just great . I would encourage anyone to see Wilson for Hilton stay needs . Thank you , Wilson ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location . We traveled with our to ##ddler . The room was bright with windows for natural light , clean and very spacious for a family of three . The location was wonderful . The bed was clean and comfortable . Will be returning ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our second stay at the Monaco this year and was every bit as enjoyable as the last . In fact just got off the phone with Kim ##pton and will be back in September again . Can ' t go wrong with Kim ##pton and the Monaco in Chicago is an example of that . Great staff + great service + great room = great stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We took our puppy , my mom , and our daughter for a pre ch ##rist ##mas " stay - cat ##ion " in Chicago . The a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s were perfect and our puppy loved her first visit to the city . My mom left her i ##pad behind , tangled in the sheets . Fortunately a very o ##bs ##er ##vant employee found it - so when my mom called , it was already in lost and found . It took us a couple months to get back down there ( embarrassing ##ly ) - but we were easily able to retrieve it . Thank you to De ##bra Johnson in Hilton security for making it happen ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Art Dec ##o style All ##egro in downtown Chicago . Perfect location in the Theater District . Walking distance to almost anything . Room ##s are on the smaller size but the am ##bian ##ce makes up for it . Very friendly staff and a complementary ch ##amp ##ai ##gn hour at 5 pm . Great restaurant , 312 , if you want dinner . I would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got 3 rooms for a girls weekend . The key attraction is their 2 double bed , 2 bathroom rooms and the location . We were fortunate also to get a good price on the executive floor where we got free breakfast and snack ##s . This hotel is historic , which we found charming , but nicely updated and very comfortable . Its also huge ~ i believe it covers half a city block ~ so know that you will be walking , potentially , a good distance . Park ##ing is expensive ~ $ 80 to v ##alet or about $ 50 to self ##park next ##do ##or . All in all a very nice stay at a beautiful old hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , friendly staff , great location . . . minutes from Michigan a ##ve . the price was reasonable . I would go there again . I used the business center which was accessible by room key and had 3 - 4 computers with access to a printer . We stayed on the second floor and got great views of the street down below . Sur ##p ##rising ##ly heard no noise from outside though . The sound ##proof ##ing was awesome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff could not of been more friendly . Re ##co ##gni ##zed me daily after my first day and always said hello . The spa steam room and shower ##s ( free ) are amazing . Location next to the park is FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C for morning runners like myself . Picture arrived is a morning view from the lakes ##ide of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The best at this hotel are the welcoming greeting ##s at the door . The rest is very average . The restaurant personnel were quite welcoming as well . The location is quite convenient to the Millennium Park , Bean sculpture , the Art Institute of Chicago , etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay here . It is at a great location and is perfect for taking your dog . There is no pet fee and they give your dog a treat package upon arrival . The staff was very friendly and the rooms were clean . The hotel was decorated in a lovely manner . We will definitely be staying here again . The down side is the $ 58 a night parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Easy , friendly check in , the rooms were extremely clean . Guest ##s are encouraged to use elevators 2 at ##a time , wear masks in public areas which we appreciated . Room service was very fast and court ##eous . We have stayed many times in the past and plan to continue ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service I received while staying was phenomena ##l , Re ##ception desk attendant Cody was very helpful with a room upgrade when I pointed out I didn ’ t care for the original room . Travel ##ing alone this time it was very important to feel comfortable . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful along with most staff I encountered . Would love in room coffee , self parking is price ##y wish there were other options . Within walking distance to Michigan Ave with many things to do . Clean room with comfortable bed , hope to stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is beautiful & views from the 20th floor lobby are stunning . The Hotel is new and rooms are clean , however ; the outside noise is no joke . We stayed on the 15th floor and it felt like we were riding in the back of an ambulance for half the night . The Hospital is across the street and the noise travelled right up the side of the building facing Michigan Ave . Service at breakfast was great & food was delicious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here on business for a few days last week . It is a very old historic hotel , and as such , has some q ##ui ##rks ( strange layout , elevator service , etc ) . Bed was very comfortable , and room was bigger than I was expecting . But it was expensive . I shop ##ped around , so I think this is just a factor of being near Grant park in the summer ##time . But for the price I paid , it was just average . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a really nice hotel . The rooms are very clean and the attendant Maria and the runner Mari helped us out with our iron . They also gave me feed back on my makeup which I appreciated . Thanks for the great service ladies . Now the parking structure is a whole different talk show ! It was 60 . 00 overnight and the structure is a nightmare . But other than that everything was great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I have stayed at The Talbot on our last 6 trips to Chicago . With many options , we continue to return this very special hotel . All of the staff is exceptional . We highly recommend the Talbot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was perfect , it is in a great location - I walked daily to the River ##walk about 2 minutes away ! Close to bars , restaurants , the River , and things to do like the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The hotel staff was V ##ER ##Y friendly , the hotel was V ##ER ##Y clean and updated . The bar was still closed so they had the night ##ly reception in the lobby - free beer and wine . The room was perfect - bed was super comfortable , Ke ##uri ##g coffee maker , couch , robe in the closet , iron and iron board , even a safe ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very enjoyable stay at the Hotel All ##egro over the Memorial Day weekend . The hotel is very s ##ty ##lish ##ly decorated and it looks and feels recently done up . The lobby and bar on the second floor have a great v ##ibe . The bar makes excellent cocktail ##s , the service is great and we made good use of the manager ' s happy hour with free glasses of Pro ##se ##cco . The rooms are small but very nicely appointed , my only criticism was paper thin walls made it easy hear conversation and s ##nor ##ing from the next room , but that ' s why I always bring ear ##p ##lug ##s . They have bicycles to borrow for free , which made for a pleasant cycle down the lakes ##hore on Sunday morning . The hotel is dog friendly and we enjoyed meeting dogs in the hallway ##s and at the happy hour . This was very good value for the price . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the pleasure of staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel while waiting on my apartment to be ready . I would like to say the front desk guy Nico was so ##o pleasant and amazing . He accommodate ##d next with everything i needed , every ##time i entered he gave me a warm welcome and a sense of feeling wanted . . Also there was a very nice young lady with curly hair who assisted me when i needed to extent my trip an extra day . Overall everything was perfect , clean , and neat . Will visit again one day and you can thank Nico and the nice lady with curly hair ( sorry forgot your name ) at the desk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel w / good amenities . Good location if you travel w / kids . High ##light of the venue was daily bell ##man named John T ##iri ##til ##li . He offered best customer service I have ever received . Look for him [SEP]
1	[CLS] I first stayed here 20 years ago but had not visited in 10 years . It is still very comfortable , very smart ##ly presented , and all rooms have some sort of view due to the design . The rooms are a good size , very comfortable beds and have great business facilities with a nice desk and decent speed W ##i - fi . It ’ s in a convenient area for the loop , Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier . It can be a little cold outside due to its proximity to the lake front so make sure to pack a jacket . Great gym with a great view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was amazing ##ly helpful and very at ##ten ##tive . They were con ##tending with the strike of the hotel staff and it extremely overwhelming for them . The noise and disruption of the protesters at the front door of the hotel was o ##b ##no ##xious to say the least . I would most definitely have asked for the 6th floor had we known this was going on . The staff that worked , really worked to make everything exceptional for our stay . They were great to provide recommendations for sights ##ee ##ing , dining , travel , etc . Love ##d the happy hour daily . Thank you for your dedication and going the extra mile ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ad ##ored this hotel . Everyone was the perfect combination of professional but welcoming . I was here for a conference and the conference services were outstanding as well . I ' d come back in a minute . Perfect location to walk everywhere too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An excellent stay in an E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##T Hotel . Breakfast was AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! ! ! Room was clean and comfortable . Service is , obviously , a focus . G ##RE ##AT location . I would , without a doubt , stay here , again AND whole ##heart ##edly recommend it ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a fun stay , we had our 3 kids and were in a suite . The window seats were en ##chan ##ting to my 5 year old , who set up a little bed for herself and slept there . Service was te ##rri ##fic , as expected at a Kim ##pton . The only fl ##aw is that the room service is from the restaurant next door , so instead of getting actual plates and silver ##ware , it all arrives in take out boxes with plastic ##ware . The food is good , though . Location was great and we walked most places we went ( Will ##ett ##s Tower , Public Bank Theater , and the river dye ##d green for St Patrick ##s day was right down the street ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very s ##ty ##lish and the staff are efficient and friendly . We stayed on the top ( 6th ) floor as some previous reviewers mentioned lower floors can get lots of street noise . But at the center of the top floor is the room for the night ##ly drinks reception ( rooms surround this center space ) , also the breakfast b ##uff ##et , so you get a different kind of noise . . . . . . . . the ' free ' drink was easily paid for by the ' resort fee ' ( it ' s not a resort , this seems greedy ) . Vale ##t parking quite expensive , but if you ' re willing to walk there are several much cheaper parking garage ##s nearby ( especially weekend rates ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had never heard of the Swiss ##ote ##l before our stay in Chicago in July . I was very impressed with the customer service , the room and the whole experience . Here ’ s a few p ##ics of our room so you can see how nice it was . Also Ke ##enan at the front desk was extremely helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have visited The Ki ##nz ##ie on several occasions and we are always amazed at how they have continually exceeded our expectations . The lobby is small but very modern , clean and efficient . The hotel staff is friendly , court ##eous , professional and dedicated to providing their guests with a wonderful visit . The king rooms are beautifully decorated and well appointed . The beds are comfortable and the linen ##s are clean and comfortable . The suites are large , absolutely beautiful and feature sweeping views of the Chicago sky ##line . You could stay at a larger hotel and you can certainly stay at a more expensive hotel but I doubt you will find a more more a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting hotel . S ##po ##il yourself and stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was central ##ly located . The lobby and bar area are very lively and with a lot of people which made it fun and entertaining . The regular rooms are very small , but it is a good place to stay for one or two days for business . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel for so many reasons , especially the lobby , so great to sit and have a drink there . Go there and be amazed . The rooms were updated a few years back and are nice and comfortable . It ' s also a perfect location for walking to L - stop , theaters , the art institute , millennium park , etc . Plus there is so much history associated with this hotel . Always my favorite place to stay in Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I needed a quiet spot to work but wanted a change of scenery having been home for so long . I took advantage of the reasonable prices and p ##amp ##ered myself . It was less than 24 hours but I had food delivered and enjoyed the bright comfortable room . A bath bomb experience after the work day too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great option off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The Ambassador is an easy walk ( 5 min ##s ) from the shops and restaurants around Rush but in a more residential area . The front desk staff were great and helpful on numerous fronts . The room was fine . . . . nothing outstanding but functional , clean and updated . Yes , the restaurant was closed but should be open soon . If you want something close to the action but that is not right in the middle of it all , this is a good spot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great weekend in Chicago to see the Cubs win the World Series and more importantly Ireland beat the All Blacks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Stay ##ed Four Nights in Public Hotel and would highly recommend it . . . very nice indeed as a top hotel which is just off the Magic ##al Mile easy walking distance to the main areas . . . . I will be back ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is a wonderful , new hotel in the heart of the action just off Michigan Avenue . It is perfectly located for shopping and great restaurants or for just relaxing . The lobby is on the 20th floor with beautiful public spaces , a rooftop bar and wonderful dining options . This will be my " go to " hotel anytime I am in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for three nights during a short stay to Chicago . Hotel is very well located and is very clean and im ##ma ##culate ##ly presented . Bed ##s are comfortable and the bathroom clean with a powerful shower . The only f ##rust ##rating thing are the positions of the electrical plug socket ##s and the light switches . This makes using electrical devices and turning lights on / off when in the bed awkward . Perhaps this is a quick fix to make the room more convenient . ( Room 143 ##1 ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was a little worried when I booked this room . I have never stayed in a Conrad before , but I will now always look for one ! ! It was amazing ! ! The room was large . The beds were com ##fy . The bathroom ##s were gorgeous and so spacious . Four people could get dressed at the same time at the bathroom counter . That is how large it was . The t ##v was massive which is important with teenagers . It had a fridge and they gave you bottle ##d water every day which is a luxury when it is 100 ’ outside . Everything was electronic lights , shades , etc . It was quiet too which I was worried about being so close to the hospital . I loved it ! Will stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just returned from a 3 - night stay at the Fair ##mont and it couldn ' t have been better . The front desk staff welcomed us and went out of their way to accommodate us with a very early check - in ( we arrived at 9 ##am from a red eye flight ) . We chose to upgrade to a Gold Club room a few days prior via an email invitation and we highly recommend you do the same - - well worth the extra money for breakfast and other treats you can g ##raze on throughout the day . Each staff member we encountered was friendly and made us feel welcome during our stay . Bed was super comfortable , bathroom was great with separate tub and shower and the location couldn ' t be beat as it was close to Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This place was a very nice hotel the staff was great and very friendly the hotel is old and is rich in history . The room was clean and ready when we arrived I would stay here when we visit Chicago again [SEP]
1	[CLS] 8 rooms booked for a stay with friends . Great service and lovely rooms . Sit ##uated close to the L train line and close to most attractions . Would definitely recommend this hotel . Very reasonable price too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hi , my wife and I had a lovely get away . We stayed for 3 nights , it is close to everything in the heart of Chicago , walking distance to everything . . . . the most important being . . . the infamous . . . B ##EA ##N ! Am ##eni ##ties were great , the pool was a welcome retreat after a long day of walking . Hotel staff were pleasant although a heads up to front desk staff . . . not everyone speaks Spanish and speaking between yours ##elves in Spanish during a check ##in . . . may not be the most respect ##ful polite thing . Over all , a lovely stay , the room had a wonderful view of the city and glimpse of the river . We recommend this hotel [SEP]
0	[CLS] The event sucked but the hotel was great . I would definitely recommend this hotel . Despite the hotel being nearly completely booked solid , the rooms were quite . My girlfriend enjoyed our stay at this hotel , the beds are extremely comfortable ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] An excellent place to stay right in the heart of everything staff very at ##ten ##tive and nothing seemed a problem for them only let down was the W ##i ##F ##i also on a positive note the compliment ##ary lemon ##ade in the lobby is excellent definitely would stay again [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was perfect for us during a recent visit to Chicago . The staff was friendly and the location is quick walking distance to a lot of great restaurants . We enjoyed our time there and will stay again during future visits to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came to Chicago for the Half Marathon and decided to stay at Swiss ##ote ##l because we got a great rate . From the second we got to hotel and we ’ re greeted by friendly employees to the minute we left , we enjoyed our stay . Our hotel room was incredible with views of the Navy Pier and city and lake . The room was huge and bed was a king and very comfortable . Also the bathroom had a se ##per ##ate shower and tub which was appreciated when I took a so ##ak after the stay . The lobby bar was quiet and nice while we had some down ##time . We completely recommend this hotel . Perfect location and great hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with my kids ( 8 , 10 ) over a long weekend and we found that the hotel was clean , unique , and in a fantastic location for our walking needs . The hotel service staff were always friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our needs , never dismiss ##ive or rude . The room itself had two beds and window seats / cushion ##s that doubled as a bed for my 8 year old ( he loved it ) . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have visited Home ##wood Suite ##s for the past 10 Years and I would recommend it for your Chicago visit . The staff is very efficient and yet very warm and friendly . The morning breakfast b ##uff ##et is delicious and they don ' t run out of food . The hotel has just been renovated and the de ##cor is lovely . We have always enjoyed our stays at Home ##wood Suite ##s . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I go to Chicago a lot for business and stay usually at one of the H ##Y ##AT ##T hotels . I was late booking and was bumped to this little g ##em of a place . For the business travel ##er it is very well thought out with high desk ##s for laptop work and plenty of outlets ( only complaint the us ##b outlets in my room didn ’ t charge very quickly ) Breakfast is available - mostly sugar ##y stuff - even the yo ##gu ##rt - but they did have boiled eggs - ya ##y ! Would advise to get better yo ##gu ##rt and fruit and add some p ##eanut butter . Staff was E ##XT ##RE ##ME ##L ##Y pleasant and I loved the sit down style of checking in . Obviously catering to the young business type . Very interesting to find the history of “ Ki ##nz ##ie ” in a pamphlet - which I read - a real Chicago ##an of whom I was unaware - thanks for the bit of history ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had booked an American girl experience . The hotel left out one girl even though I had spoken to them two days before . We waited as they added the special bed but then they forgot about her add on ##s that night . Vale ##t service was more than disappointing Room service was excellent [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice Bo ##uti ##que hotel in a great area of Chicago . Walk ##able Area with Rush Street restaurants & high end shopping very near to the hotel . We felt very safe in this neighborhood . Room ##s were room ##y for a big City . House ##keeping kept the room very t ##idy . Staff was friendly . Just be aware it is a walk to some of the major tourist areas - River Walk , Millennium Park , Navy Pier . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recommend this hotel , the location is ideal , very easy to com ##mu ##te downtown . I just have an issue with the check in process as they charged two times my credit cart and it was not easy to fix the issue but now everything is okay . Also the process of breakfast , the last day only served on the 5th and 6th floor we were on the 2nd and the lack of fruits was a problem for me . Otherwise the staff was friendly and lovely . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a very good location . As a gold member I had 15 dollars to spend towards the restaurant in the hotel . The service is amazing . There is also at least three people at the front door to greet you . The lobby is at an amazing 20th floor . b [SEP]
0	[CLS] You feel p ##amp ##ered and in ##du ##lge ##d . The rooms , bed ##ding and baths are wonderful . The restaurant ’ s breakfast is delicious . The paste ##ries are heavenly and o ##mel ##ettes light and flu ##ffy . Bar is great place to relax and enjoy . You ’ ll be happy you went . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Most Hilton hotels are large , but with over 1 , 400 rooms the Hilton Chicago is particularly substantial . Operating on such a scale the hotel lacks charm , but it has lots of energy . Because of the number of guests amenities like the pool and fitness are not available to all guests without additional charges , although executive level rooms grant access . The hotel ' s location is hard to beat . It is within walking distance of the Field Museum , She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , and an incredible playground at Mill ##eni ##um Park . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Public Chicago felt like home away from home . The staff was super friendly and inviting . I loved the atmosphere , but I wish they would ' ve let me microwave my G ##ino ' s pizza . They have a policy against outside food that was a little dish ##ear ##ten ##ing , but it did not stain my stay at the hotel . I felt like royalty here and I would definitely advise others to stay here as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a stunning lobby and wonderful history - a must see if you are downtown Chicago ! Be sure to get a brown ##ie or two ( developed by Palmer House ) and check out the Empire Room before you check out . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This property is an o ##asis in the heart of the magnificent mile . Very convenient and close to everything . The staff are very professional and court ##eous while the amenities are superb . A very good value for a suite in this part of the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Service was super nice and our room had the perfect view . The breakfast server was fast polite and nice . The bartender was incredible knowledge my drink was just perfect . Our room was ready did not had to wait . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The con ##cier ##ge was so helpful from how to travel by bus , take a j ##og a class or get a healthy bite to eat . It was also a wonderful surprise to swim in the pool with such history and character . En ##joy ##ed my stay and will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just 2 blocks north of the Chicago River , the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was just awesome . We were checked in by Ken , who was one of several very helpful people ( along with Drake and a young woman whose name I can ' t remember ) during our entire stay . The continental breakfast was more than we expected , as was the happy hour and app ##eti ##zers . The room was very clean , and house ##keeping was " on it " for our entire stay . The room even has a mini fridge in case you need it . The dual head shower was awesome as well . Everything about the Ki ##nz ##ie was absolutely fantastic . The neighborhood is alive , but not too loud . We will definitely be staying there again in the future , especially if we get a great deal on the room as we did this time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Brand new and loved it ! Great location and amenities . Em ##p ##loy ##ees were all very friendly , helpful and knowledge ##able . We have 3 young teenagers so needed our space and the corner suite was perfect . Fe ##lt like an apartment . Love ##d the work ##out room too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##ab location and wonderful staff . Breakfast is a joy . Sur ##rou ##nded by lots of wonderful restaurants and the shopping area is just around the corner . You are just a walk from all the major attractions . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Once we got bye an awkward check in experience we had a lovely time . The rooms were huge . Hu ##ge t ##v , huge bathroom , huge room . Really good sleep and a great view . Coffee in the room the next morning was also good . En ##joy ##ed breakfast downstairs . Overall a wonderful time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni did an overall great job with our stay . The rooms were clean and the breakfast was great ! The only issue was with the bar . The mixed drinks were not good . They may have mixed up measuring the alcohol since the drinks were extra sweet without much alcohol . We were celebrating our anniversary and they even surprised us with a bottle of sparkling wine ! I would recommend this place since you are on the ma ##g mile ! Just get wine instead of a mixed drink . : ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is a perfect blend of old and new . The lobby is classic luxury while our room was spacious and up to date in every way . But what makes the hotel special is the staff . This has been our best hotel stay by far . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This historical hotel is awesome and well cared for . Just a warning to all that you have to ask for a coffee pot and supplies for your room when you check in , or the night before . I realized that there was not one after we came in late at night . I texted the con ##cier ##ge and they said they would get me one the next day . I texted them at 9 ##am and they said that room service did not begin until 5 ##pm ! There was no way we were getting coffee unless we got dressed and went down to Star ##bu ##cks on the first floor . They wouldn ' t give me any explanation , just a " sincere apology " . I just don ' t get it and it really left me pretty irritated . I ' m not sure if we ' ll stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location as it is convenient to so many attractions , restaurants , and stores . The rooms are very nice , two room suites . We stayed on the 18th floor and it was very quiet . I am not sure what lower floors would be like in terms of street traffic noise . The staff are exceptional and they are what put the hotel over the top for a 5 star rating . Breakfast is a little more than a typical “ all included ” breakfast . It can get very crowded at times during breakfast but we always found a nice place to sit . Food was always p ##lent ##iful and coffee was always available . I am returning to Chicago for a 6 day visit and have already booked my room at this hotel . The hotel does not have a con ##cier ##ge that I am aware of which is the only negative . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location . Staff was very friendly . I wish I was in a higher floor for the water view . I would recommend this location to family and friends . The staff was very friendly and always available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel ! ! ! ! Great service , rooms , and the bar / g ##rill has wonderful drinks and food . Most if not all food items are made from scratch . The cheese pairing with their home ##made jam ##s is a must ! ! ! Hotel is in the middle of Michigan Ave . , perfectly situated ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our latest visit to this hotel was fairly typical : excellent experience at check - in , room exceeded expectations . Service was tip - top . We ' ll be back . Q ##UE ##ST ##ION : Is there some rule against hotels putting real cream / half & half in the rooms to use with the Ke ##uri ##g ? Some hotels do it . If you ' re worried about it s ##po ##iling , then what ' s that in - room refrigerator for ? Who wants powder ##ed cream ##er ? Ye ##ee ##cc ##ch ##hh ##hh [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at the kin ##zie this past weekend and we were greeted by Arturo G ##ar ##za . He was one the the most genuine and nice ##st person I ’ ve yet encounter at a hotel . He was extremely helpful with local restaurants , things to do , and even suggested a few of his favorite spots to visit . This experience made my stay more enjoyable and I was more welcomed into the city . Thank you for everything Arturo ! High ##ly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] After booking through a 3rd party I became very frustrated however , customer service manager was able to save my wife ' s b ##day weekend . I ' m happy because this was our first stay at this location . We were overly pleased from the am ##bie ##nce and s ##wan ##k style of the room . We were able to take a moment and enjoy the bar located in the hotel . The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in . And we have been to quite a few 5 star hotels . We will definitely will come back as this was a grand weekend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every person we encountered at the Ki ##nz ##ie was helpful and happy ! This was the first time we have ever used v ##alet parking . I look forward to staying again at this beautiful and efficient hotel ! Computer ##ized check in made it easy to just walk in and pick up our keys . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in the Jewel ##ry district . It has 2 good places to eat bar bites or Hilton breakfast . I was impressed with the location IF you don ' t mind a walk to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The rooms are clear and the property is pretty cool . Didn ' t use the G ##ym but I believe they have one and a Pool . This is a no Fr ##ill ##s historic hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was so pleasant ##ly surprised when I checked in my room , I was upgraded to a suite with a hand written note to welcome me from Charles letting me know if I needed anything , he was available . The personal touch meant a lot ! K ##wa ##me at the front desk is so helpful , charming and a delight . I have stayed several times at this hotel . From the staff in the restaurant to the door ##man , every one is friendly and make my experience delight ##ful . This is my hotel of choice for all my future stays ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel room is ch ##ic but so comfortable with a bed , couch and great lighting . The bathroom is a pleasure with double sinks , luxurious linen ##s and fine amenities . Location of the hotel is wonderful with easy walking to Michigan Avenue and many restaurants . That ' s a good thing to be close to restaurants since the hotel offers two places to din ##e but with very limited hours . We were unable to have a cocktail and dinner or snack after a show . The other hotel restaurant closed at 2 : 00 in the afternoon and the promised deck top dining was not open . We did have breakfast at the hotel and appreciated the am ##bian ##ce and views but our eggs were under ##co ##oked and the rest of the meal was l ##uke ##warm . We think this hotel has lots more potential and we hope they get their dining act together . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We received the royal treatment along with our standard p ##ood ##le . It was most fun to sit in the lobby during cocktail hour with her elegant ##ly stretched at our feet surveying other guests . The location is vibrant , although a little beyond walking to Michigan Avenue . Kim ##pton does such a great job of preserving the style and grand ##eur of old hotels . They are my favorite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I were impressed with Kim ##pton All ##egro ' s Art Dec ##o de ##cor , clean ##liness & service . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located in downtown Chicago & just a 45 ##min ride on the L ( blue - line ) away from the airport . Kim ##pton hotels never let us down ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in town for 7 days and chose So ##fit ##el for the stay and i can say it turned out to be a great experience . What i really liked about the place : A ##wes ##ome location as its next to the magnificent mile and also a CT ##A station , staff was really awesome and went all the way to help on issues , check ##in / check ##out was an effort ##less experience however an ex ##or ##bit ##ant price for the Vale ##t parking specially for the resident guests was a major turn off for me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So , this is not a review of the hotel , per se , but a review of the lobby bar . This is one of my favourite lobby bars . It is far enough off Michigan avenue to have a manage ##able crowd . The staff is excellent , goes out of their way to keep me happy . Great selection of local beers . Excellent weekend entertainment with Chad Will ##ets and his trio . S ##nac ##k selection hits the spot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I like to take the train in from the airport and there is a stop right by the hotel ( you ' ll also learn where Miller ' s Pub is ) . There were 3 clerk ##s to check in at 8 : 30 pm . So , it was a quick process . Reservation was correct and I got upgraded to a king room . The room was nice , and very clean . If I have a complaint - and just one - you have to con ##tor ##t to use the rest ##room . The toilet paper is immediately behind you above the toilet . Check out was convenient and the hotel was a block from my meeting . Whenever near W . Monroe , that ' s where I stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with friends in June 2019 . I shared a room with a friend and the others stayed in different rooms . The room itself was clean , comfortable and welcoming . The bathroom was clean and I have to say , I enjoyed the pressure of the shower . My house doesn ' t have this much pressure so I enjoyed it as it washed my hair super well . The hotel itself is very pretty especially the lobby . It is so grand and reminds me of an old era . The lobby bar was equally amazing and the bartender was nice . The hotel is central ##ly located to transportation and is walking distance to Millennium park and the Art Institute so that was a bonus as we did do some sights ##ee ##ing . I enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a quick overnight at this hotel . The room was very comfortable and nice , although a little warm ( the ##rm ##ost ##at really didn ’ t do much to change the room temperature ) . You can ’ t beat the location , but parking ended up a little difficult to find . I wish we would have had more time to explore the hotel and the surrounding area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super location , nice hotel , but definitely geared towards business and conventions . As a family trip found it was a bit price ##y but overlooked that based on location . Staff was outstanding and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I took our 2 girls to Chicago for the night and we wanted a hotel that was convenient ##ly located . This hotel was perfect ! It was right in the center of everything ! The staff was helpful and friendly , the room were great and the food was delicious . They made our stay worry free ! I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is nice and house ##keeping was good . The hotel only has two elevators which usually causes a lot of back up . On one of the days one of the elevators was broken which really caused a big problem . The rooms are space ##y but just seem like they ’ re getting worn . The linen ##s and carpet need an upgrade . It just did not have that feel of a Hilton which is one of my top choices when traveling . The location is good but for the price will probably stay at another hotel next time . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at the Talbot ##t for our daughter ' s wedding and it was wonderful ! The accommodation ##s and atmosphere were very relaxing but the biggest stand ##out memory was the staff ! From Du ##ane making everyone feel like part of the family in the lobby to Brian doing everything he could to feel like we were visiting his own kitchen with amazing food and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting our every request , we felt very at home at the Talbot ##t . We highly recommend this home away from home , but make sure to take time to get to know the people who work there , they are truly amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] There ’ s not much more that can be said about this historic hotel , so I ’ m going at it from another angle . As a solo female , the am ##bie ##nce of the lobby is so warm and friendly that I would just go and sit , either at a table ( that are long which encourages multiple couples ) or in a com ##fy chair and just k ##ib ##but ##z with other friendly people . The buzz of all the people plus the music playing in the background just creates a great energy . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay was very good thanks to the very friendly and helpful staff . I highly recommend staying at the H ##ya ##tt re ##gen ##cy Chicago . Hassan was very helpful at check my in . He started my stay off with a positive experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for one night only . The lobby area is nice and the check in was quick and friendly although busy . The room had an acceptable size for a family of four , but looked like it had no upgrade since the 1980s . Bath ##room is ok , although I never feel comfortable with the am ##eric ##an standard shower ##s . The hotel is very big with large meeting capacity and was very crowded at our stay . The location of the hotel is fantastic , walking distance to Ma ##g Mile and the Loop , but also to the Navy pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great 1 night stay for a business trip in Chicago at the She ##rato ##n . The 1 king bed room is very spacious and clean . The bed was surprisingly hard unlike other hotel beds . The in room breakfast ( chef ##s o ##mel ##ette ) is awesome and more than enough for 2 persons . The hotel is in good walking distance to downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] convenient ##ly located to our favorite restaurants , shops , outdoor activities , sporting events and family . The well ##ness center is great v ##alet and bell service is quick , at ##ten ##tive and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . Check in and out was easy and accurate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just recently got back from Chicago ! Ce ##le ##bra ##ting our 30th anniversary and stayed at the kin ##zie hotel ! Just wanted to thank Spencer and his team for making our stay amazing and for welcoming us with champagne ! ! Love ##d this hotel very clean comfortable and the staff are very pleasant ! Thank you for making us feel right at home ! Love the wine between 5 and 7 nice touch before dinner ! Breakfast b ##uff ##et was included and definitely will return one day ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best bang for your b ##uck . . . except the noisy emergency vehicles at night . . . family of four . Super room size and friendly very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Pool was small and cold , but we went for Chicago , and this hotel is in prime location for American Girl store and all tourist attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A lot of history in this hotel and a very beautiful place , especially the lobby / lounge area . We loved our short stay . Very romantic v ##ibe . Our one king bed room was very spacious and the bed and pillows were very comfortable . Bath ##room was a bit small but not too small . Pool was closed being refurbished so that was a down ##er . Only other real complaint if you call it that was the T ##P . A class ##y place should spend a little extra and provide a better quality choice . En ##joy ##ed our stay and would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here two nights and found the location to be convenient , the rooms were spacious and comfortable , nice bathroom , great dining options . Love ##d the rooftop bar - nice views , great drinks and menu . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel numerous times in the past and have never had any complaints . The rooms are nice and I generally have a great view of the city , and the staff is very friendly and knowledge ##able . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 2 nights here for business ( Monday and Tuesday nights ) and was very happy with the stay . Check - in a breeze , lobby beautiful and just sorry I had to leave too early for breakfast and did not get to experience the snack ##s from 5 - 7 ##pm . Room clean , comfortable , great view , quiet , good temperature . Nice to have a big fridge , and the table was good for using my laptop , plus there were many outlets for charging all my devices . I will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at the Palmer House was to celebrate a special anniversary of meeting there . Everyone from the registration person , to the con ##cier ##ge , to our bell man , to the Potter ##s restaurant personnel were g ##rac ##ious , pleasant and helpful . One of the event set up men was kind enough to interrupt his work to take our photo . The architectural de ##cor of the lobby is f ##abulous and historic . Our room was well furnished , updated , and the bed ##ding very comfortable . There are nice and different choices for in hotel dining , plus a Star ##bu ##cks in the lower floor that opens at 5 : 30 for early birds . The location of the hotel could not be better for public transit , restaurants , Millennium Park or the Art Institute . Love ##d our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here this past weekend and our stay was a ##bs ##ou ##lt ##ely incredible ! We were downtown for my birthday and for a concert . We enjoyed eating at the Columbus Ta ##p - the hotel ' s restaurant - great beer , great food and great service ! Perfect for before a concert ! They made our stay so special with birthday cup ##cakes and other treats : ) Thank you so much for such a memorable weekend ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a small funk ##y hotel in a great location near the river . It ' s friendly and they have wine in the lobby every night . The only down ##side is that if you have a river view you face a huge t ##rump sign on t ##rump tower ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The door ##man was great , like the other reviews said . The place was clean and well kept , no complaints at all . These folks really do a good job of efficiency , and the meeting room staff was great ! Very cute , little dog dish of water in the front lobby ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve been going to this hotel for over 15 years . Our last few visits we notice the hotel was dated and needed a re ##f ##resh . That was a couple years ago . My wife and I stayed there last weekend and were amazed by the hotel re ##mo ##del . Just about everything was new . We got a $ 229 park and stay rate - a great price . Location is perfect and staff was very friendly . Looking forward to another stay ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is tremendous , water is hot , pressure is very good , and the room layout was very good . The internet was fast and the help was great . I loved the morning drink deal where they deliver to the room . Very nice per ##k that they do , especially two drinks per person . Only items keeping it from a 5 star was the price of v ##alet - site said $ 50 per day and it turned out it was $ 70 per day . I fully understand the challenge of parking there , but I didn ’ t like the surprise in the cost for it . The other item was the noise in the room . Quite a bit of street noise all night , we should have requested a higher floor . Even with the above items , I would definitely stay here again in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont chain must have replaced their pillows - now very uncomfortable and hard to sleep on . Had the same problem at the Seattle Fair ##mont . Must be an A ##cco ##r hotel change . May have to avoid this chain ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay at the hotel . On arrival the guy standing outside was waiting to greet us and take our bags . David was the other person on duty who was extremely helpful and knowledge ##able . On check - in we were upgraded at reception . The rooms were lovely and clean . We had a fully stock ##ed mini - bar that was re - stock ##ed if you used anything plus an ice bucket . The location is just off The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and about 15 min ##s from the River ##walk and 20 min ##s from Navy Pier . A ##qua ##rium , Field Museum and Planet ##arium are about another 30 minute walk on but it is a lovely walk along Lake Michigan and through Millennium Park on a nice day . There is an accessible subway station just 3 blocks down if preferred . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From Emily ' s clear directions on using public transportation from the airport to the fine recommendations for nearby dining and local attractions from con ##cier ##ge Tim , the service was first rate . Many thanks to the " Lost & Found " department for recovering my Kind ##le that I left on the nightstand and sending it to my home so promptly . The hotel ' s location is perfect for walking to great restaurants and fine shopping . The " Delaware King " room that we had was taste ##fully updated , room ##y and clean . I enjoyed wine and delicious hum ##mus in the friendly bar . This hotel is not over - the - top fancy , but has character and was just what we were looking for in a bout ##ique hotel . I hope it doesn ' t lose it ' s Jo ##ie de V ##iv ##re unique ##ness now that it has become a H ##ya ##tt property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic hotel and fantastic sales team . Our group of 50 guests enjoyed a perfect celebration recently in our favorite city . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions , meals , and service were what you expect at a So ##fit ##el property . We will be coming back in our next visit to the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My family was really pleased with the location of the Hilton Chicago as it is directly across the street from Grant Park and within easy walking distance of Millennium Park and a p ##let ##hora of restaurants and shops . The hotel is beautiful and our room on the 21st floor was Q ##UI ##ET which was really important to us . You can hear the rumble of the L , but you don ' t notice that in a very short time . It is a beautiful historic hotel with a gorgeous lobby and rich history . We enjoyed walking through the public areas and seeing the photographs of the hotel through its existence . The staff are friendly , knowledge ##able and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location on Michigan B ##l ##v ##d . Good view from corner location . Di ##ff ##ic ##ult to reach control of d ##rap ##es Need to take two elevators in and out Otherwise Excellent in every way except lighting . Can not read in bedroom . No ni ##te lighting lead to fall and injury [SEP]
1	[CLS] At first sight when i booked the hotel it looked nice on the pictures . When I arrived after 3 . 30 ##pm my room was still not ready and I was waiting 45 min . Staff forgot about me and if I didn ' t turn up to the reception I could have been waiting longer . The room was quite old and not very t ##idy . Overall it was an average stay and I wouldn ' t consider this proper ##ry to be a 4 star hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love how ch ##ic the All ##egro is , and how I could easily walk to countless dining and shopping options from the hotel . As soon as I entered the lobby , I was made to feel welcome . Leah was especially ho ##sp ##ita ##ble , ensuring I had a compliment ##ary glass of Pro ##se ##cco in hand before social hour ended , and having a Ke ##uri ##g machine sent up to my room quickly . The room seemed small but has everything I need , including one of the com ##fies ##t beds ever . I definitely plan to stay at the All ##egro next time I ’ m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A beautiful bout ##ique hotel , in a superb downtown location . Coffee in the lobby is the best . I would have given it 5 stars , but upon returning home , found we had been charged for a bottle of wine from the fridge . We took our own wine and beer . I called hotel and they had the charge reversed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was big , view was of alley and roofs : ( Bar in lobby had a nice atmosphere , restaurant in lobby ’ s breakfast was outstanding ! Easy walking distance to the Navy Pier , Red Line and shopping on Michigan [SEP]
1	[CLS] stayed overnight 8 / 14 for Cubs game originally booked room online must ' ve re ##set day to same day I got the room so when we went to check in they didn ' t have me on file for that day when I booked online it was $ 161 . Henry was great th ##o he said I was able to get a re ##fu ##nd for my original booking it would take a couple days to process and I would have to re ##book for $ 210 for that day we obliged . Over a week later and still no re ##fu ##nd I try contact ##ing accounting only to get a voice ##mail I leave messages and no reply . I really wanted to like this place and give a good review but waiting for them to make it right [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location near Grand subway station and shopping . Wonderful ##ly friendly and helpful staff and a great breakfast . Nice rooms and very relaxed atmosphere . The well appointed kitchen ##s in he suites make it a great place for longer stays . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel at a fantastic price ! Close to everything with great service . Room is decent size for 2 people with a king bed . Bath ##room is good size ( toilet hangs on the wall ? ) Bar on the ground floor as well with project ##or on the wall broadcasting football games . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was very pleased and surprised at the quality , efficiency and level of professional service delivered by the staff . I look forward to staying there in the future . My only negative was the cost of v ##alet parking . Its too high . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I checked out , I was told the balance was zero . But I just checked my credit card activity , I was charged $ 8 without a reason . Hopefully they could give me an explanation . This kind of action was not professional . Thanks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I visited the Fair ##mont Chicago while she was in town for business . We ' ve stayed at the property a number of times and have had consistently friendly service and good quality sleep . The guest rooms are spacious and the location is convenient - across the street from Millennium Park and an easy walk to Michigan Avenue . Despite the hotel being busy due to a trade show that was in town , we never had any issue with room noise . The staff is court ##eous and read to assist . We will be visiting this property again based on our positive experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place rules . Stay here . The property is gorgeous and the staff is super friendly . Room ##s are clean and the beds are so com ##fy ! The location is perfect for downtown walks . Very close to any shopping or ne ##cess ##ities . W ##oo ##ho ##o ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great historic property with very nice rooms . Great location . Basic lobby with limited amenities , but super helpful and friendly staff . Easy walking distance to Rush Street restaurants and bars . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved everything about this place . Friendly and great staff ! Fantastic location ( away from the congestion but easy walk access ) , delicious food and spacious and clean rooms . I highly recommend it ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel ! Cut ##e hotel with an old school Hollywood theme . Room was clean and quiet . They serve compliment ##ary coffee and tea in the morning from 6 - 10 ##am and have a nice happy hour from 5 - 6 ##pm . I would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand is perfectly located in Chicago close to amenities and walking distance to the Navy Pier . The beds are wonderful with com ##fy pillows but the setup of the room is q ##ui ##rky with the t ##v stuck to one side in the corner and the bathroom down a hall . Not a big deal just odd is all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First class experience every time . I stay several times a year . Front line staff have been there for many years . Veterans and know how to take care of you . In particular , Val ##da , hotel driver , and if you are lucky , Mir ##ham will greet you with a smile and courtesy on arrival . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed there this week for a conference - hotel is a bit tired - room was " well used " and very much in need of a re ##f ##resh . Used room service once , arrived on time as needed to attend a meeting but ha ##m with eggs was very fatty - expected it to be better for some $ 38 for breakfast of eggs and coffee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ided to stay downtown for my wife ' s birthday . Found a great rate at Swiss ##ote ##l . Every staff member we encountered was so friendly and helpful . When checking in the front desk attendant attempted to ups ##ell us on a better room , she was very polite , but we were on a budget , and declined . I thought that would put us in a room facing a brick wall , however we had the most wonderful view of Navy Pier . The bed was amazing , the bathroom was spot ##less . It would have been a perfect stay , had it not been for the couple next door that fought for at least 2 hours . My wife ended up calling the front desk so that we could finally get some peace . Check ##out was super easy , we just dropped the keys in the drop ##box . De ##fin ##ite ##ly willing to give Swiss ##ote ##l another shot . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location , clean and has nice views . The breakfast and the happy hour are both nice touches we ' ve enjoyed . However our favorite piece of this hotel is N ##I ##K ##KO ! ! So a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , so kind and full of energy . My boyfriend and I have come a few times now from LA and so excited to see him . Plus he compliment ##s my beauty and outfits every ##time I leave : ) H ##E is truly a g ##em . I have worked in the hotel industry for many years as a director of sales . It is staff members like him that make our businesses ex ##cel to the next level . Nik ##ko , you would be so so so good in the sales department at the hotel too ! Thank you for all of your hospitality , you make that hotel ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Best , Margaret . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family spent a long weekend at this hotel and had a nice stay . The v ##alet ##s and front desk workers were nice and helpful . The best part of the room was the giant TV . Room was nice and clean , but tight . Bed ##s were comfortable but rough with two people on a double bed . Not sure if that ' s standard for Chicago , but our volleyball team booked the rooms so I didn ' t look at any other hotels . Pool was closed during our stay , but we would have liked to try it . For independent travelers , I parked at the Ogden Street G ##ara ##ge a few blocks away to avoid the v ##alet parking has ##sle , and that worked out great . It even has in and out privileges , which helped immensely . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Near to the subway , great lobby , a walk from the park , co ##sy breakfast and professional service . The Palmer is a nice place to stay for a short visit . My room 12 . 165 was next to a machinery room and quite noisy . The only minus on this trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been to The Talbot ##t a number of times for business and it ’ s on a lovely tree - lined street with a neighborhood park in one direction and shopping on Michigan Ave in the other . In warmer weather , the restaurant spill ##s out onto the sidewalk and under the trees , which is beautiful . The hotel is going through a needed renovation and should be much more up - to - date soon . Du ##ane is one of the long - standing door ##men who makes guests feel welcome and taken care of . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is good , this is the best thing this hotel has , rather than that this is an average hotel with rather low customer service . The food at the restaurant is average . The reason I am giving this as poor is because of , again , the service . I arrived late night and was given a room on the 4th floor facing another building I called the lobby to see if they had a room with a nice ##r view to what they said that I had to pay more , I guess the person at the lobby choose to risk and wait for more people even though it was late night rather than making the ones that already pay ##ed , happy . There are more than 20 di ##fer ##ent hotels in this area at same rates . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ambassador is a M ##US ##T stay hotel in Chicago ! Not only was our room gorgeous , it was im ##ma ##culate ##ly clean , quite , and comfortable . In addition to the s ##ple ##ndo ##r of the building , the entire staff was incredible ! Everyone went out of their way to help make our stay extraordinary . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for my nephew ’ s wedding and had a wonderful visit . Ra ##fi the door man was extremely helpful and has just a fantastic attitude . We really appreciated all his service and advice on restaurants . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is the only hotel we will stay in during our frequent trips to see our daughter in college . The location is excellent for the theatre district or shopping on Michigan Avenue . The staff is excellent and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The rooms are spacious and well appointed . S ##p ##lu ##rge and ask for a room with a river view and spend some time watching the river traffic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They provide a fridge but as a guest you can ' t use it . They pre ##fill it to get more money out of you . As if their daily room rate isn ' t high enough already . Also the room set up is not the best . The TV faces the side of the bed . It just wasn ' t thought out well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice . However , directions throughout the hotel for the meeting spaces were not customer friendly and quite confusing . The staff were extremely helpful in getting me to the right place . The gentleman at the bar with the d ##red ##s was very helpful as well ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sur ##prise ##d this hotel has 5 stars AND great ratings . Stay ##ed here just one night , and for me it seems like a great average 4 star business hotel . Not the usual So ##fit ##el experience so be careful if you have high expectations . - The location is great for exploring Chicago . - The lobby is modern , dark and mood ##y and smells great ! - Check - in was quick but nothing personal . - Hotel corridors are bright and colorful - not really my thing . - Room was average but clean . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not luxury and bed was incredibly soft . - They did have La ##n ##vin toilet ##ries - k ##udo ##s ! Wouldn ' t recommend or stay here again . There are better places in Chicago . . . Virgin Hotel , Peninsula . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay here ( not through choice ) with work and each and every time the Internet is absolutely un ##usa ##ble . Please please please fix it , it is un ##bearable not being able to connect - I lose many hours of work time here . It ' s un ##fa ##th ##oma ##ble that you still haven ' t sorted it , it ' s been months [SEP]
1	[CLS] Will definitely be back to stay in the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel , from the spacious bedroom to the happy hour we enjoyed all the Ki ##nz ##ie had to offer . It ' s in an ideal location , with pubs , restaurants and shopping all in walking distance , as is access to all forms of public transport . The staff were friendly and helpful , the text service with reception was useful and included recommendations on things to see and do . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment we walked in the front door , I could tell that this was going to be one special bout ##ique hotel . Every single person treated us like we were family . Our room was lovely and clean . The bar area was so fun to relax in . We can ’ t wait to go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the second year I have attended our hospital Gala at the Hilton . I wanted to to say first of all this is a beautiful historic hotel . The v ##alet parking was convenient and the staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The event : the food was exceptional ! All of us have been to weddings etc where food had to be served to large groups . It ’ s a challenge and the we ’ re up to the challenge . High ##ly recommend this venue for any large event ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 4 nights attending a conference at the Hotel . It was also my first time in Chicago and I was very happy the Hotel and its location . The room was spacious with a nice view south down the lake ( admitted ##ly peek ##ing between the surrounding sky ##scraper ##s ) and well appointed . The staff were friendly and efficient and the amenities ( W ##i ##F ##i , gym ) good . I borrowed ( free of charge ) a good quality bicycle from the Hotel for a very pleasant couple of hours . Re ##com ##men ##ded . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I stayed in a river view room and enjoyed the views . Also , we visited the Link coffee shop to get Star ##bu ##cks and light breakfast . Several times , we walked up and down the river walk and took in the sites and the fresh air . The staff was court ##eous and took care of us , from the front desk , to the bell ##men , to the con ##cier ##ge , to house ##keeping . Overall , it was a great stay and we would return here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Gold services were not comparable to those we have experienced in other Fair ##mont locations . The staff was wonderful ; the lounge and the restaurant were not up to the usual standards . The location is great but it just didn ' t feel like a Fair ##mont Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a very nice hotel excellent ##ly re ##mo ##del ##ed with a modern style . The room was spacious clean and very comfortable . They have a fully equipped gym and a full sized lap pool that are of the best quality I ' ve seen in a hotel in many years . The staff are excellent and super friendly . The only thing missing is free internet and smart TV ##s . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very comfortable and s ##ty ##lish ! We always enjoy our time in Chicago and we always stay at the So ##fit ##el ! The breakfast is amazing , you must try it ! Great location within walking distance of many amazing restaurant and shopping options ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can ' t say enough about the customer service at the hotel . They are amazing ! Also , the hotel is the perfect setting for our formal annual event . The quality of the food is extremely high . Alto ##get ##her , an amazing value for the overall venue and location . Other hotels / venues don ' t come even close to being competitive ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l on our wedding night . Upon learning that it was a special night , our clerk , Nicole , offered us a room upgrade at a fairly reasonable price . We took her up on the offer and could not have made a better choice . The room was beautiful , the view was beyond belief . We found the hotel to be clean and the staff to be very court ##eous and helpful . We liked it so much we stayed another night a few days later . Although the room was not quite is big nor the view quite as nice , it was still a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great beds , wonderful staff from check - in to wait staff in restaurant , clean and nice physical plant even though it was confusing to navigate . There always seemed to be a kind person to point me in the right direction . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Within walking distance to the lake , magnificent mile and great bars / restaurants ! Beautiful , spacious room and bathroom and imp ##ec ##ca ##ble service . Pro ##mpt v ##alet service . All - in - all a fantastic experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is very cool and historical . They offer a historical tour of the hotel at 3 p . m . on Friday ' s . I think this would have been cool to do , however , that seemed to be the only time they have it , and we didn ' t arrive until 4 p . m . The check - in was quick and staff were very friendly . The room was clean and the bathroom ##s were amazing with the overhead rain shower . The value was exceptional as well . I did notice the safe didn ' t seem to work properly in our room . Other than that , our stay was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A recommend ##able option in the River North neighborhood . I only stayed for one night but they got all the little things right . A ##rri ##ved just before midnight and was offered a much - appreciated cold bottle of water during check in . All staff I spoke with were very friendly and helpful . The room had character and was very well laid - out given its co ##zier size - nice de ##cor in the bathroom as well . The hotel is very clean ( also caught an accidental glimpse of the kitchen which looked spot ##less ) . G ##rab ##bed a c ##rois ##san ##t and a coffee on my way out in the morning but the rest of the breakfast options looked good . A small thing , but I like that they have real mug ##s with the in - room coffee facilities , rather than creating unnecessary paper / plastic waste . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is so large , kind of hard to keep everyone quiet . But its a beauty and in an amazing location . The noise wasn ' t terrible , usually pp ##l halls , but once in their room it was fine ! Clean room and hotel . Very pleased ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great people work here ! Hotel room had coffee and great beds . Bath ##room well stock ##ed and everything was clean . Restaurant in lobby had a great breakfast with good service . Just a few blocks from magnificent mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Let me start by saying that I am a H ##H Diamond member . I am accustomed to being upgraded to either a dedicated Honors floor or to the Executive floor , regardless of the room rate I reserve . I checked in online and the map on the site was very vague . The original room was quite small and I asked for a quiet location . I was old no upgrade was available . After a few texts , an upgrade to a Jr . Suite was mi ##rac ##ulously found . This " upgrade " was a two room suite with a small bathroom , and a well worn small refrigerator on the floor just inside the entry door . The best part of this hotel is the decorated lobby at the Michigan Ave . entrance . The rest of the hotel is not up to par for a Hilton . [SEP]
1	[CLS] beautiful lobby with the most impressive fresh flowers arrangement ! the bedrooms are a nice size , the beds are super comfortable and the f ##rag ##rance of the soap ##s and cream are a true f ##rench delight ! the morning past ##ries are the best when you need a delicious breakfast on the go , the restaurant and the bar are also excellent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni hotel is in a great location and has great views ! My kids really enjoyed it since they received a little bag with kids activities and cookies at night ! I have to dock points though because our shower was not working ! I stayed overnight this past weekend and went to take a shower on Sunday . The tub backed up quickly and would not drain . I let the front desk know and they said thanks for letting them know but I feel like a backed up tub is a big deal for a one night stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is a good location with a great staff . I was upgraded to a larger room with a lake view . Nice ! Had a few mechanical problems but they were take care of quickly . Our maintenance person John did a great job [SEP]
0	[CLS] I wish it was longer than one night , I ' d of stayed the whole weekend if I was able to ! The main lobby was super modern and luxurious . The room I booked was exactly like I pictured it to be with such an awesome view of downtown Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice environment . Room ##s are modern and clean . Love having breakfast down the hallway . They give you coins to use for drinks at happy hour . They also have a small cheese tray and hum ##mus to snack on . I would definitely come back . Em ##p ##loy ##ees are very nice and a great attitude [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was with friends over a weekend . The rooms are great . A very nice breakfast offered . An excellent plus the beer evenings with snack ##s . Very good location in downtown . Staff so kind and ready to assist [SEP]
0	[CLS] I would definitely recommend whoever is visiting downtown Chicago to consider this Hotel . It is amazing . The staff were awesome , the rooms were neat and clean and the views around are breath ##taking . Thank you H ##ya ##tt Regency for making my stay awesome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price and service we received this place is stellar . The staff was very helpful with tips and checking us in early too . We arrived in the early morning and the staff allowed us to get in our room a bit earlier . The front desk went through where to go & great places to eat . Also , in the morning the free breakfast bar was great ! I enjoyed the the staff the most , George helped us with ideas on clubs & hot spots . The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is located in a great spot with tons of bars and places to eat within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While we stayed for the Lights Festival and our room was beautiful . There was a few areas that the hotel staff need to work on . As an Ambassador Member we check in early ( absolutely love ) and we suppose to receive welcome amenities ( had to ask for them ) . Had to wait for service to bring extra towels and ice ( was told they were extremely busy ) and room keys did not work on the day of check out ( although we get late check ##out until 4 ##pm ) . We had to take four U ##bers ( was credit $ 20 ) to go din ##e and shop because v ##alet was extremely slow . Oh ##hh , was escorted up to our room my security and my children were locked out of the room ( key issue ) . But the hotel looked beautiful as usual . A few other issues but I did share them with management . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent property with an outstanding location in the Gold Coast area . The staff was extremely helpful and seemed to enjoy their work . The room was clean and modern with a great view of the area . The bar was alive with energy and had quite the f ##estive atmosphere ! We will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , comfortable , and efficient . Great views and convenient location too ! I like their sustainable practices . Great incentives for not requiring daily bed ##line ##n change . The room rate itself is extremely reasonable but listed prices on the room - service menu are too high . However , there are many good eat ##eries within short walking distance from the hotel . We did not try the on ##site restaurant because we figured the prices would be similar to the ones for room - service . The pre - check ##out service and key - drop facility are really helpful and such a pleasant time - save ##r . Overall , a really great experience and we will be happy to return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service at St ##ets ##ons was terrible , very slow felt like others were more important than our group of 6 ! Food was great but we were an in ##co ##vie ##nce to our waiter ! He really didn ' t care . Too ##k 15 minutes for drink order , apologized he was busy , and we didn ' t see him for food order for another 15 minutes . It ' s very uncomfortable waiting with important customers . We spun it and wage ##red on how long it would take for him to show . Made a game of it ! Not good ! Won ' t go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed one night on a free weekend night certificate that I wanted to use before it ex ##pire ##s . I chose this location based on proximity to the museums . Hotel was large and historic , but seemed to lack charm . It was more well suited for conference attendees than couples . The bed in my room was comfortable , but the heating vent ##s were very dusty . The bathroom looked u ##til ##itarian , more as if it belonged in an airport rather than a quality hotel . We did not spend any time in the spa , but we got some late night bites in the Irish bar and restaurant . There was live music which was a nice touch . We didn ' t take advantage of the breakfast v ##ou ##chers we were offered as gold members because we had br ##unch plans the following morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and myself stayed here for the weekend . Great location close to food , shopping , coffee / juice bar right next door . We were able to park the car for the weekend and walk everywhere . Room was nice and clean . Not much for scenery right next to another building . Which it is Chicago so we were not shocked . Maybe if the view is important to you , mention that when your making your reservation ’ s . We just kept the blind ##s closed . Great price also for the location . They do have v ##alet which is nice but a little price ##y at $ 60 a day . We parked at a garage about a block away and paid $ 48 . For 48 hours . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d our stay here , location is great , all suite hotel with nice furnishings . In the heart of the magnificent mile . Living space was ample , and separation of sleeping area was good . Our room overlooked Michigan A ##v . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s a beautiful old hotel . Used to be the biggest ##0 hotel in the world . Really good sized rooms with small bathroom ##s . Lo ##bby is magnificent . The bar is located in the lobby and is a great place to have a drink . Great location too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed one night at this hotel visiting friends . They are very clean and felt comfortable staying with the CO ##VI ##D guidelines . The location and the lobby / hallway ##s are exceptional . The only downfall was our room . Our room was very dark and had a funk ##y odor . I would stay at this hotel again but would make sure my room was up to H ##ya ##tt standards . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price I wasn ' t impressed . . no breakfast included and the de ##cor a bit tired . It was a great location and near the river for a j ##og in the morning . It ' s just a shame the service and that bit extra isn ' t part of the deal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just perfect for weekend visits to Chicago . Big rooms and clean , surprisingly quiet for downtown . Double Cross lounge happy hour makes it a no brain ##er . Josh is the best , great attitude and service . Will come back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have been working with Kathryn at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in Chicago on room blocks for my son ' s wedding and his fi ##ance ' s bachelor ##ette party . Our experience has been fantastic , from making the actual arrangements to her willingness to go above and beyond our expectations and provide extra " per ##ks " for us . Kathryn ' s re ##sp ##ons ##ive ##ness , as well as that of the entire staff , has been excellent ! We stayed there last weekend and our room was f ##abulous , as was the service we were given and the happy hour we attended . Thanks so much to the Ki ##nz ##ie staff ! We look forward to our longer stay in October ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a great time in Chicago . The Home ##wood Suite ##s on Grand was very pleasant . The location was perfect and the pool was one of the warm ##est hotel pools I have ever used . The only complaint was there was no hot tub but i knew that when i booked the hotel . Everyone we encountered was extremely helpful and very friendly . I would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has the grand old charm , but could use a bit of up ##grading . The lobby chairs need new springs , a good dust ##ing would also help . The restaurant uses i - pad menu ##s which make comparison selecting very difficult : a printed alternative would be helpful . House ##keeping is a bit slips ##ho ##d - trash cans are not emptied daily , coffee supplies are not kept current . The staff is great ! Very helpful and a ##cco ##mo ##dating . The location is near tourist / shopping areas but not in any creative neighborhood . Bring money for anything nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel is great - right next to the river and very handy for the bean and the magnificent mile . The lobby gives an impressive opening to the hotel . It is a huge hotel . The room was very nice , clean and room ##y and the bed was fantastic ##ally soft . The only down ##side was that the curtains , although slightly overlapping , did not block out all of the light in the morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So ##fit ##el hotels are nice everywhere and this property is no exception . They have more " style " than Mar ##riot ##t ( I chain that I do like ) , but at a similar price . Although we prefer smaller bout ##ique hotels , for a " chain " hotel , So ##fit ##el is quite nice . The staff was polite and helpful in all areas of the hotel . The bar and restaurant are lovely and have great food and drink . The lobby is elegant with a nice " W " type v ##ibe ( subdued lighting and me ##llow " club " music ) . The rooms have beautiful light woods accent ##s and the marble - filled bathroom is excellent . Although the hotel is actually quite large , it doesn ' t feel as big as it is . We would happily stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was just appointed that the rooms didn ’ t offer the microwave and the queen room is very small . I was not offered an upgrade after I had trouble changing my reservation . Ian ’ s parking is ridiculous price [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a grand dam ##e of Chicago and still exists for many reasons : friendly staff , beautiful building , great rates for its value too . The best thing , however , is its location ! It is only a few blocks from many of the city ' s main attractions : Art Institute , C ##IB ##C theater where Hamilton is playing , Symphony Hall , Michigan Avenue , Grant Park , and tons of restaurants of varying price . It ' s worth the price and is an experience in its own right ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a great experience except for the final 10 minutes . There is an expression that the last 10 minutes of the movie is the most important part . Leaving here when they were short a cups for water in the lobby the reception ##ist told me to go speak to the bar , basically it ’ s not her job . Need ##s more training in kindness but the hotel is very good , comfortable , soft sheets and towels , quiet , clean . I recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently visited Chicago for the first time and spent two nights at the Conrad , which we thought was superb . The room was very well equipped and extremely comfortable and the staff could not do enough to make our stay special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for 4 nights and loved it . It is perfectly located . I walked almost everywhere with the exception of a walking tour in Lincoln Park and the subway was a few blocks away . The staff are super - friendly and make great suggestions . Breakfast was convenient and had healthy options . Happy hour was a nice touch with the coins for free drinks and app ##eti ##zers . I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here on my next visit to Chicago . Thanks Ki ##nz ##ie staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for two nights 4th of July weekend . Our dog and cat were welcomed with open arms . We needed their food re ##f ##rig ##erated and the front desk was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Hotel has great location there is a Corner Baker ##y down the street as well as a McDonald ' s . You can access the Star ##bu ##cks through the hotel . This hotel is right in the middle of the theatre district . Our room was on the small side but it was beautifully decorated and the bed very comfortable . W ##if ##i was excellent . The staff very friendly . We would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very disappointed with the room we were given . It was the size of the closet and faced a brick wall . As a silver H ##H member , it was quite a disappointment . The pictures on the website are not in ##dicative at all what the rooms actually look like . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Connie and Renee are amazing ! Too ##k very good care of us while we were here all week . If we needed anything they had it ! The food was always fresh . We had plenty to eat for breakfast and it was well worth the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is central ##ly located just off the magnificent mile so shopping very close by and nice eating joints . Room ##s are a bit s ##hab ##by and tired with very limited personal supplies . Breakfast ##s are done fresh although arrive to the table cold . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were pretty happy with the stay . Although our room was not ready at the Check in time , which is 3 p . m . , we were not in a hurry to get in . However , it would have been nice to drop off the bags . Once we got the room , we found it to be clean . Spa ##cious bathroom . Room had a little more furniture than it could accommodate , but again , it was fine . The bed was comfortable enough . Pi ##llow ##s - soft . It was a little bit on the noisy side though . You could hear people walking through the hallway and when they closed the doors , they are heavy and they slam , making it super loud . Would I recommend it - Yes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We keep returning to the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal because it is always wonderful . Our room was beautiful and away from the elevator , as requested , so it was very quiet which is exactly what we needed . The staff is friendly and helpful . The location on Michigan Ave is central to where we wanted to go in the Loop and Gold Coast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It doesn ' t get more central than this ! Walking distance to all the great places of Chicago . My friend and I found this hotel to be lovely and the staff to be extremely ho ##sp ##ita ##ble , especially K ##wa ##me at the front desk and the door ##men . We were always greeted with a smile ! The room had a large , lovely bathroom and comfortable beds . The view wasn ' t much , but it didn ' t matter . Great rate for a central ##ly located hotel . Will definitely come back [SEP]
1	[CLS] The at ##ten ##tive ##ness of the front desk staff was excellent , we were able to check into our room before the official 4 pm check - in time . The room was large , clean with beautiful floor - to - ceiling windows that had automatic shades that you could control from a panel near the bed . You could tell that the hotel took a lot of consideration to add modern finishes to the room . It was beautifully decorated and the bed was very comfortable . The hotel offers two restaurants : one on the rooftop that makes ST ##RO ##NG m ##o ##jit ##os and an indoor restaurant that offered a delicious breakfast menu . I will definitely return to Conrad for my next Chicago visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived very early , but they had a room for us . The con ##cier ##ge was helpful . Most importantly , we were close to Mill ##eni ##um Park for the Jazz Festival and A ##qua was right across the street . Fantastic view of the lake , too . The experience was just wonderful overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is awesome and the room was very comfortable . Would definitely stay here again . Having the kitchen was great for traveling with the family . The staff was very friendly and helpful . Pool on the roof was small but fun for the kids . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Chicago is my favorite destination for a long weekend and we usually stay at the O ##m ##ni when we visit . We had a nice weekend with no s ##tag ##gering interrupt ##ions to our visit . The only thing I noticed in our room this weekend was that it was needing repairs or updates . There are marks , and holes around the room and it was not as aesthetic ##ally plea ##sing as other rooms we have stayed in . Otherwise , it ’ s a great hotel in an amazing location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent accommodation / helpful staff / great location . What couldn ’ t you like about this hotel and it ’ s position on the magnificent mile 2018 . Great position to explore all Chicago has to offer . Great that Star ##bu ##cks opened early for the marathon breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] not a bad place at all . Good location nice clean friendly no complaints about this place . would go again . Close to everything you need could just walk or u ##ber / taxi to bars . De ##f ups ##cale place in a great location feel safe booking it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is absolutely stunning ! Beautiful de ##cor and 5 star service all around ! The beds were super comfortable ( I ' m pick ##y ) and decorated wonderful ##ly . My only issue was with the room sizes . We were in a King and there is literally no room for anything . The same with the bathroom . We didn ' t even have enough room to un ##pack anything . My husband and I kept having to say " excuse me " over and over again to each other due to how small the room was . I ' ve stayed in A L ##OT of hotels but , never one this small . It would probably be ok for just one person . Other than the room size , it was a wonderful stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##rona ##virus restrictions and reduction ##s are understand ##able but still disappointing : few staff members around , and no room service ! But the place is spark ##ly clean and rooms are spacious , all is well - kept . The swimming pool , though warm as bath water , is a gorgeous ##ly - restored reminder of the original luxury of this place in the 1920s . Bed ##room was clean and spacious , though the mattress was a bit worn ( not solid ) . Fortunately there were few guests , as the elevator now should only hold 1 family at a time ! Great location along Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , indeed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I stayed at this hotel in Chicago on Grand and W ##aba ##sh and couldn ' t have been happier . The hotel was pleasant ##ly updated and clean , hotel staff was friendly and inviting . Our suite was beautiful and enough room for us to enjoy our stay and not feel cramped . The location was excellent in the heart of downtown and we walked everywhere we went with no cab rides necessary . Love ##d it and would stay here again and recommend to friends and family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent stay , clean and comfortable rooms , excellent w ##if ##i throughout the hotel . There are bus stops about a block and a half away but it is possible to walk along MI ##chi ##gan A ##v . to many tourist places including the Lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came to the hotel on a family trip . We had a huge room , there was a swimming pool and they use clean pack n plays instead of c ##ri ##bs which was great . The only down ##side to the pool is that they all ##oc ##ate some of the lanes for lap swimming . Which I ’ m sure is nice for some , but really cut down on the space for our kid to play [SEP]
1	[CLS] What you would expect from a Hilton property in a premier location : convenience , style , and comfort . Great location , in site amenities and top flight service can all be found at 720 S Michigan Ave . We were on the top floor and , while we couldn ' t see the lake , the views of the Sears Tower were great . Stop for a pin ##t at Kitty O ' Shea ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very efficient and customer oriented staff , and a well kept and maintained facility . Location , location , location ! Walking distance to so many different sights , restaurants , pubs , etc . Never once felt ignored . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon arrival , very impressive hotel , great location , friendly and professional staff . As a Mar ##riot ##t employee at the Mar ##riot ##t World in Orlando I was very impressed with everything . The room ( double bed ) was very s ##pec ##ious and clean . Special shout out to house ##keeping Just ##a and her supervisor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoy staying here every year for our Black Friday Shopping trip . Close to all the best stores and a short walk to the Water Tower Mall . Also very close to our favorite breakfast place Corner Baker ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel was awesome . Right next to the River and the subway station . The hotel de ##cor was very modern and taste ##ful . The wine hour was the best . I don ' t know of any other hotel that offers guests a F ##RE ##E hour of wine in the lobby . My group and I enjoyed this very much . We said the " key phrase " ( see their social media site ) at check in and were given a free bottle of champagne ! So nice ! What we didn ' t like was that there was no fan in the bathroom , so it was really humid in there . Also , there wasn ' t a coffee maker in the room , so we actually had to get dressed and go down stairs to get a cup of coffee ( kind of annoying ) . The A / C didn ' t seem to work very well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t understand all the great reviews . We stayed in a suite , which was two regular rooms that were opened up to each other to make a " suite " . Fu ##rn ##iture was old , you sank right down to the frames , was covered with white slip covers to give the illusion of el ##egan ##ce . Bath ##room was the smallest out of any king suite that I have ever stayed in . One person could fit in . Show ##er was just a plain stall . Bath ##room door was broke and wouldn ' t fully shut . T ##ile was old and disco ##lore ##d . [SEP]
0	[CLS] O ##m ##ni Chicago is in the heart of Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The hotel staff was very inviting ; the door staff made sure we had directions and offered suggestions on things to do on each of our out ##ings . the king suite was more than adequate for my family of four . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were clean and the bar is very co ##zy . It ' s a good solid place to stay but not a scene . We only needed a place to drop our bags so we were happy . The staff is norm particularly friendly but the girls behind the bar were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First of all , I will like to thank Kay for her warm customer service just speaking with her on the phone . When we arrived , I knew we booked the right place . From v ##alet , to checking in , to Mr . Wayne taking our luggage to the room , explaining all the amenities and suggesting some good places to tour and eat , while celebrating our 25th Anniversary . Thanks for the over the top hospitality this hotel provides . E ##X ##CE ##P ##TI ##ON ##AL ST ##AF ##F ! ! ! ! This will be my spot in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has wonderful service and exceptional rooms . Very close to magnificent mile but yet on a pretty street off of the mile . Room ##s are larger than what you would normally get in a Chicago hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment I stepped in the door the staff were great . Very welcoming and helpful . My room was on the 14th floor overlooking the river . It was a King room , it was huge . It ’ s convenient ##ly located near to Trump Tower / Apple Store etc . About a mile from the Navy Pier . I ate in the lobby bar twice and I have to say the food was very good and reasonably priced . Check in at 3 ##pm and Check Out at 12 : 00 so if you ’ re not in a rush you can have a lie in . If I come back to Chicago I would definitely come back to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The sheets had not been changed . . . there was a blood stain and series of blood spots below the pillow . I discovered this when I pulled back the comfort ##er to go to bed . While the front desk and house ##keeping were quick to respond to my concern and did change the sheets , I find it alarm ##ing that not only were the sheets not changed but they were notice ##ably dirty ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this hotel , it was located just within walking distance to shops , food or even the waterfront . It was my fi ##ance ##s birthday & he was to arrive before me , I contacted the hotel to see if something fun could be done to the room . I was put in contact with Faith , and she helped make it happen ! She had chocolate covered straw ##berries , a bottle of champagne & happy birthday balloons set up upon his arrival . The views are good & there is a lot of natural light in the all white rooms . This hotel is very , warm , dark , co ##zy & romantic . The bar is quiet w a fireplace & nice lounge music playing softly . The only bad thing was the house keeper walked in a couple times when it was not very good . Made for a laugh though ! We will definitely be returning to the P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Em ##p ##loy ##ees , Property , Location were A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E . New Years Eve event . . . . . . NO ##T W ##OR ##TH IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Check in was great . Manager on duty got us a better room then paid for . G ##F and I loved the evening overall . . . . but the NY Eve event did not live up to the expectations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , friendly staff especially the bell ##men , v ##alet and staff at front door . Te ##rri at the in house room service was a sweetheart and made sure we had everything we needed each morning when we ordered breakfast room service . Marcus the con ##cier ##ge was very helpful and gave us great suggestions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING was amazing . The rooms were ready as soon as we got there someone in my family hurt her ankle and they called urgent care for us and gave her a " feel better " bag . On the 33 floor there was a great breakfast , ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres bar , and one person working there was amazing Rene was very caring and funny . He was very interactive with all four of us kids and called the only boy of 4 children Ba ##m Ba ##m and Ba ##m Ba ##m loved Rene , we hated to leave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is just ok , There were s ##cu ##ffs all over the bathroom wall and the bathroom looked quite dated . The worst part is it ' s loud ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly needed ear ##p ##lug ##s to sleep like I do in a cheap motel . I think their windows need double g ##la ##zing . We really liked the evening drinks , they were good quality drinks , not Bud Light , which was a pleasant surprise . Live it up cause they charge you about 25 dollars a night for this " service " whether you use it or not . Breakfast was ok . Past ##ries weren ' t the best though and the room is far too small for the size of the hotel . Both times we went for breakfast there was no where to sit . Location is great , but I ' d probably try a different hotel next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent a few days at the So ##fit ##el and I am very happy overall . Pro ##s : - Great service - Nice ##ly decorated rooms and super clean - Great Location : right downtown - Nice bar ( very friendly bartender ##s ) - Very relaxing environment - Free W ##if ##i - the breakfast a la cart ##e is well done , nothing price ##y . - Some employees speak French - Con ##cier ##ge very re ##sp ##ons ##ive : within 5 m ##n after calling the con ##cier ##ge , I had what I ordered ! Con ##s : - No b ##uff ##et breakfast - my mattress was uncomfortable I definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have been to this hotel previously and enjoy the bout ##ique am ##bian ##ce . It is in an excellent location and easily accessible to all city attractions . Service post pan ##de ##mic is typical of other hotels we have been to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice , comfortable and quality hotel . It is convenient to Michigan Avenue and the shopping . Close to the lake ##front , and to nearby restaurants . I would definitely stay here again when I return to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for one night and there was 3 of us in one room . The room was spacious and had 2 double beds . The room was not the clean ##est I had seen and there was a dirty glass on the tray . The view was great from the 26th floor . The W ##i ##F ##i is not free in the rooms - only in the lobby , which in this day and age in a city like Chicago I find completely bizarre . I did not eat at the hotel . The location of the hotel was great and given this I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good hotel , clean , great location , great happy hour great value . Breakfast is the only slight fl ##aw as it ’ s not as varied and can get boring but is good and has a couple of options . F ##ab hotel can ’ t really fault it [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had the pleasure of staying at the Swiss ##ote ##l this past Memorial Day weekend with my partner . We were was upgraded to a corner room with fantastic views of Navy Pier , Lake Michigan and the Chicago River . Special mention to the manager Eric G ##er ##mata , whom we encountered in the lobby and was ever so cord ##ial and when he heard about our anniversary , he sent us a bottle of wine to celebrate . Amy at the con ##cier ##ge desk was extremely helpful in setting up dinner reservations and ex ##cursions . This was our second stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l and we plan on coming back soon . Thank you for a memorable stay ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel . Amazing staff — I ’ m usually a Mar ##riot ##t member so this really showed me that ’ s Mar ##riot ##t May need to step up their game . ; ) . From the hotel staff to the beautiful rooms everything was 5 Star ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing hotel . Very comfortable beds . Clean rooms . Lots of elevators so wait time was minimal between floors . Con ##ven ##ient location for Thanksgiving parade . Would def ##inate ##ly recommend to anyone including families . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Hotel All ##egro for a four night business trip . I found the All ##egro a well cared for property that appeared clean and in order . Staff was always at ##ten ##tive and helpful . The bed and pillows comfortable . . . . but the ( standard ) rooms are small and dark . My king - bed equipped room only had an office chair to sit in , no couch , love seat , or up ##hol ##stered side - chair to relax on ( as shown in their room pictures on their website ) ; for one night that may not be bad , but not good for a four night stay . If I visit Chicago again I would not stay at the All ##egro . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I could not ask for a better quality hotel . The rooms are sound proof , the beds are very com ##fy , N ##es ##press ##o machines in the room . 65 ” TV ##s . This is my 2nd time staying here and I will continue coming here [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was great but the best impression was left by a young woman at the registration desk named Cassie . I had an issue that needed a quick resolution and Cassie resolved it quickly . Her people skills were highly professional and customer service skills were excellent . She was patient yet showed a high level of concern and a willingness to go beyond the call to help . Cassie was fantastic and is truly an asset to the hotel [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had an amazing experience here at the luxury suite . I usually don ' t write reviews but from checking in , service and check ##out AL ##L F ##IVE stars . Staff was very friendly and helpful . I ' ll be coming back shortly [SEP]
1	[CLS] The only reason I ' m not giving 5 stars is because I ' m the room the night stands are too large and have a huge sharp corner . My husband has a huge cut from that . Otherwise , it was a very nice hotel and everyone was very nice there . Just watch out for the sharp edges ! ! Lo ##l [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was clean and wide enough . The food was really good the staff is really helpful and the music in the lobby was pleasant and various . We stayed in the room 520 which was perfect and quiet enough . W ##if ##i is strong enough to ensure up ##load of large files . Good spot ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My boyfriend decided to w ##his ##k me away from Denver to Chicago for a birthday weekend . He chose the Conrad because of the chain and because it ' s new , and I must say the experience was beyond outstanding . Beginning with the staff , and by that I mean absolutely everyone employed there that we interact ##ed with , was friendly , court ##eous , and helpful . Special shout out to Jenna at the front desk and Justin at Ba ##st ##ille and Bourbon on the 20th floor . 1 / 2 block off the Miracle Mile , too , close to everything . We would both stay here again in a heartbeat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve been to this hotel twice , and both times our room wasn ##t ready until A ##FT ##ER 4 ##pm which was really annoying ( both times ) . Room ##s are dated . I asked if there was another that was more updated , and was told my room was updated ( e ##ek ) . Pool is really deep and big , which is awesome , especially for a hotel pool . Over ##night parking was $ 71 . That ' s absurd . Windows didn ' t keep sound out which made for a loud night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cody and T ##ip ##hani ##e made our stay in Chicago even more delight ##ful with their hospitality ! They treated us each day with an enthusiasm typically showered on visiting monarch ##s . Yes , we felt like royalty ! ( C ##ue the parade wave ) They provided solid information and great recommendations for everything from dinner to tours to rooftop bars . Overall the hotel provided a great venue for the conference and party and a perfect base for sights ##ee ##ing . Hotel staff was professional , polite , and friendly . Great view from room 171 ##8 on the Gold level . Large room too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the hotel for 3 nights and absolutely loved our stay . Clean hotel . Friendly staff . Could not ask for more . Tanya was great with our room and so thankful she found my wallet ! Thank you Tanya ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was amazing ! Great room with wonderful view , staff was friendly and helpful - we would go back in a heart beat ! You can ' t beat the location . The room was clean , we enjoyed the toilet ##ries - large bathroom with shower and tub . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Short get - away as the weather finally broke toward spring in Chicago . The H ##ya ##tt hotel and staff made me feel safe during these unusual times by implementing safety and security co ##vid protocols . The rooms are spacious and the hotel location is great . High ##ly recommend for a get - away , even for native Chicago ##ans . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location and common areas of this hotel make it seem like it would be a good place to stay , but in fact it is both in ##con ##ven ##ient and the rooms are average at best . The worst part about the hotel is that it there is really no access to Grant Park or any of the places that seem very close on a map , but are actually blocked off due to the buildings and infrastructure . The rooms are weird as the building is in a triangle and there is a serious pinch point in the lobby when things are crowded . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very old and it shows everywhere , from public areas to rooms , which ( at least in my case ) are also quite dirty and not properly looked after . For instance , toilet ##ries were not re ##ple ##nish ##ed properly every day in more than one occasion . Room service is also extremely slow , one night I had to wait almost an hour for a b ##urger ( at around 9 ##pm ) . Also , I noticed and raised with staff that my shower head was c ##log ##ged with scale deposit , but no one did anything about it during my four nights stay . On the plus side , rooms a quite large by Chicago standards , but again you do little with it when fur ##nish ##ing is old and dirty . . . Coffee maker and tea are of the cheap ##est quality im ##agi ##na ##ble . I will definite ##l not be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our view out of the window from 20th floor was the same view as the TV show The Honey ##mo ##one ##rs . Brick wall with windows and fire escapes . Very de ##pressing . Room was very small . The refrigerator was so tiny and filled with stuff . We emptied it but still couldn ' t even fit a six pack of beer in f ##rig hardly . If you have alcohol bring a cooler . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was great , very clean and had a wonderful stay . Room was very comfortable . close to everything downtown , wonderful view of downtown city . Staff was very friendly and professional . Breakfast was filling and ta ##sty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful Hotels from lobby to rooms to restaurant . Well done ! ! Very friendly and helpful staff . Next to the Cadillac Theater close to so many attractions and Restaurant ##s . Co ##m ##fy beds , clean rooms , yoga mat ##s and robes . Mini bars in rooms . Great stay . Will come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3 . 5 rating might be more accurate , especially if user friendly breakfast is a priority . Excellent location and hospitality . Room ##s are clean and well designed . Overall v ##ibe is relaxed and hip . Cave ##at : breakfast is a work in progress , and there are no easy alternatives unless you ' re willing to walk several blocks . If user friendly breakfast is a priority , look elsewhere . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wonderful property on Michigan Ave where service is their what they are know for . Hotel rooms spacious and newly re ##mo ##del ##ed . You will not be disappointed . Em ##p ##loy ##ees are dressed in a more formal business uniform reminding you that you are in a class hotel and they smile at you when you come face to face . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the Design of this hotel , both aesthetic ##ally and functional ##ly . I stay in a lot of modern hotels , even own a small bout ##ique hotel myself , and have never given much thought to the desk in a hotel . I usually consider them just a generic am ##eni ##ty that is needed although rarely used . I stayed in So ##fit ##el twice now for business and realized after the fact that their unique layout of the desk makes it much more useful and pleasant to get work done at than any other hotel . I like staying in the room to work on my computer and phone calls more than a coffee shop . It doesn ' t take anything away from the design of the room aesthetic ##ally or for a vacation function either . Nice job whom ##ever designed this . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is modern . Located in the city center . The rooms are very comfortable and spacious with everything you need for a comfortable stay . The staff is well trained . There is one , but significant draw ##back , standard breakfast ##s at a very high price . A two minute walk from the hotel you can eat much ta ##st ##ier and half the price . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This really is a great place to stay , either for business or pleasure . The location is outstanding and is near many of the attractions that are must see . The hotel is very comfortable , quiet , and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying at a Hilton property and it won ’ t be my last . Kitchen ##ette available for those of us with food all ##er ##gies . Service , especially the male breakfast attendant was awesome . Clean room , incredible location , friendly staff all the way around . Will absolutely be staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel , employees were great . The only reason they didn ' t get a five star was the actual bed i slept in was on such a s ##lant that it prevented me from getting much sleep . I ' m sure once the management sees this review it will be correct . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was a good experience . The hotel was clean and attractive ##ly decorated . The staff was friendly and I did not experience any problems that weren ' t ratified immediately . I would recommend this hotel for anyone that wants to experience Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just wished the compliment ##ary breakfast was better . Room service was also over ##p ##rice ##d and sub ##par but overall really good ! I would definitely recommend this because it ' s in an ideal location right next to the ma ##g mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed four nights for our first trip to Chicago . The entire staff was friendly and helpful . Wonderful room on the 28th floor overlooking the John Hancock and Lake Michigan . After sights ##ee ##ing all day , enjoyed a glass of wine in there outside sitting area . Location was convenient for sights ##ee ##ing and to catch a train to W ##rig ##ley Field . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This O ##m ##ni has a great location right off North Michigan Avenue and a very friendly staff . The staff was quick to accommodate any needs we had such as room and turn ##down service and we were able to check in early which we requested . High ##ly recommended and we plan on staying here again in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve been to many hotels in Chicago , and this has been the best . The hotel staff truly intended to help the best that they could . They were ever present . The rooms were great , although I do hate the sliding bathroom doors , which are becoming way too common . The room price was on par with other hotels of the same caliber , but it was notice ##ably superior to the rest that I ' ve previously stayed at . The one down ##side was that on one day , room service was 15 minutes late . I didn ' t however din ##g them for it , as they gave me full credit for the meal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room had a beautiful view of the river . Fu ##rn ##iture a bit out ##dated , but worked perfectly fine . Nice bathroom with all amenities . Staff was absolutely pleasant and answered every question I had . The parking was a bit extreme $ 70 / night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An hotel with old fashioned charm and in a good location , but it is very badly in need of a re ##fu ##rb . The reception and lobby area needs new carpet ##ing and a general upgrade . It has a very run down feel . The bed was comfortable and clean but the room was more than a little s ##hab ##by ; bathroom floor tiles cracked , s ##cu ##ffed walls and badly f ##ray ##ed carpet which was just this side of being a trip hazard . If I ’ d been staying longer I would have asked for a different room . The food in Nix was fine but an incredibly slow service . I sat for 15 minutes after being given the breakfast menu before anyone took an order . Overall I was very disappointed with my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got 2 rooms . One was super amazing on the north side of the building . The other room was on the south side of the building and was significantly smaller . But , they both had good amenities . We chose to hang out in the bigger of the 2 rooms . They both have great views of the city and it is convenient ##ly located by all of the great shopping and Eat ##aly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff friendly and helpful , room sizes are of good size with good views , the location is great you are able to walk to ma ##gni ##f mine , hotel bar has great views of the city . Would highly recommend a stay at this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a gorgeous hotel - exterior and interior . The room was one of the clean ##est and nice ##st that I ’ ve stayed in . The view from my room was breath ##taking . I was there to attend a business conference and never would have spent this kind of money on a room out of my own pocket , but it definitely was something to experience . There was nothing to complain about except the price tag . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A positive hotel experience within downtown Chicago . Within walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants on Michigan Ave and close to the L station . Staff were friendly . Room was larger than I was expecting . Very clean and modern . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The internet was not working during my stay . It was truly unfortunate because overall the staff was great but paying a fee for no working internet was unacceptable . I hope they fixed this problem . It is a great property and hopefully I can return again soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice " Bo ##uti ##que " hotel , pet friendly , good sized rooms decorated in the I ##KE ##A style . P ##ump Room bar is open late , and is surprisingly lively . Very at ##ten ##tive staff . Location is a little out of the way in a lovely Gold Coast residential neighborhood . The 151 bus , 2 blocks away on N Lakes ##hore Drive goes every few minutes to N Michigan Ave shopping and eventually to Union Station . Check out all the photos of celebrities who stayed here in the 40 ' s , 50 ' s and 60 ' s in the basement elevator lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came to celebrate my husband ’ s birthday and thanks ##gi ##ving We have spent 30 minutes to discover the v ##alet weren ’ t in their spot with no room to leave our car . They have double booked us And the room is ne ##lly and full of dust Not a proper happy birthday welcome Certainly not a 5 star hotel service [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms and location are absolutely great and rates are generally lower than comparable properties . I think it ' s one of the best values in Chicago . Room ##s are very large ##s with comfortable beds and nice modern bathroom ##s . The hotel and rooms are very clean . If you are ok to give up some lobby amenities , the hotel won ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Couldn ' t be happier with our stay . Everyone from the door greater ##s , check in desk , and house keeping were friendly and helpful . The hotel is a perfect location the take in the city and all it has to offer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great , with easy access to the Ma ##g Mile and lake ##front . The staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting from start to finish . Our standard room with king bed was spot ##less and charming , and we both loved the shower with option of hand - held or overhead spray . The bed was very comfortable . We booked online with a search tool and got a very good rate for a Saturday and Sunday night stay . Our w ##i - fi charges were com ##ped as we checked out - a class ##y touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time we stayed here . I liked the location and atmosphere . People were excellent to work with . Very close to the Cadillac Palace theater , 312 restaurant and Kind ##le Mart . Many plus ##es to stay here . Did find bathroom to be smaller than would like and the bathroom vent did not clear humidity very well [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure . Great location , accommodation ##s and staff . R ##oof top bar and extremely short walk to Michigan Avenue and dinner at Joe ' s St ##eak and C ##rab . Don ' t forget to get the dirty ma ##rt ##ini with blue cheese olive ##s at Joe ' s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I understand the current safety concerns and pre ##ca ##ution ##ary measures being taken but when you book a room with a view you expect not to have toilet issues or a ram ##bling elevator shaft that ’ s disrupt ##ive throughout your stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 2 nights at this wonderful hotel . It is in a great location , the rooms are luxurious and spacious ( even with 4 of us sharing one room ) the staff are friendly and helpful and the free bike rental makes the exploration of the River ##walk and the Navy Pier so easy and enjoyable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Coming to the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel while on business , my expectations were not optimistic . However the staff and hotel exceeded all expectations , it was a place of pure comfort and relaxation after meetings all day long . The front desk really went above and beyond to make it an amazing experience . The 24 - hour fitness and business centers made it like a home to me and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a smile in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was great - Amir was what really made the experience great ! He helped us get our car each morning and was so friendly , always had a smile , and even offered to have our car ready each morning without having to call down . He was very court ##eous . [SEP]

1	[CLS] staff was great , very helpful . Room was very large , just needs more electric outlets Could use a little up ##dating . Great location for both the lake and downtown tourist attractions . If we return we would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a weekend night . Nice building , good service , no issues . Room is smaller , but has everything you need and is good quality . Great location downtown within walking distance to just about everything . There is a parking garage right across the street , but will cost you extra . Re ##com ##men ##ded . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a group that stayed at this hotel and they have nothing but good words to say . From check - in to check - out the stay was smooth . They appreciate how a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting the staff were . And A + for the breakfast . They loved it . Will definitely refer clients here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Perfect spot on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Star ##bu ##cks in lobby which is very convenient . Wine bar on premise . Friendly staff . Clean rooms . Reason ##able price . Quiet . Spa ##cious rooms for a city hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House , the longest continually operated hotel in America , has a wonderful lobby area with a magnificent f ##res ##co ceiling . The rooms could use an upgrade . There was a cold draft in our room and the heating and a ##c unit had a hard time keeping the te ##mp even . If you want to eat there bring your wallet . $ 30 for a full breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this hotel numerous times and it ' s always great . This last trip was during Co ##vid 19 and even though things were strange in Chicago , the hotel did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . The staff ( especially Malcolm ) is exceptional - friendly , helpful and court ##eous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place I can ' t say enough good things about this hotel . Located just a block from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and a short walk from the Blue line from Oh ##are airport , the location is amazing . The hotel offers a wine reception each night and compliment ##ary bike loan ##ers . The rooms are charming , with double window seats . . . complete with pillows and a gorgeous view of the river . The in room snack and drink bar was well stock ##ed and the staff went above and beyond . I will stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect hotel in Chicago City Centre . A brief work visit , but the hotel offered everything required for a short stay . Excellent service from Re ##ception through to room service and the lobby bar . Room ##s were well appointed and decorated . Everything was well maintained and kept ‘ up to scratch ’ . I would definitely recommend . Thank you [SEP]
1	[CLS] My architecture team stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l during the freezing cold temperatures we had over the past couple of days . O ##bed ##die helped with all of our last minute needs , and made our stay effort ##less . The customer service was outstanding , not to mention how comfortable the hotel beds were . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is our go - to hotel when staying in Chicago . I ' m rarely disappointed . This last trip was one of those unfortunate rare times . All - in - all everything was good . The only issue was finding a dirty so ##ck from a previous guest under the d ##rap ##es in the room . Knowing that this is not a common experience here , I am willing to forgive , but it ' s why I couldn ' t rate this as a 5 for this trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First stay . Room ##s are small , but clean . They offer a variety of amenities if you forgot something . We took advantage of the humid ##ifier ##s they had on loan because I was sick . The staff was friendly . It was easy to walk everywhere . Park ##ing is expensive , there are plenty of garage ##s nearby that are cheaper . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 5 days for a conference . Great location . We were on the 34th floor a floor above the con ##cier ##ge lounge . You use the stairs to go down to the club entrance - too bad there was no entry on the 34th even though the club was on both floors . Good conference space and the River ##walk was a real treat . Clean spacious room and good w ##if ##i , friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was earlier the Am ##al ##fi Hotel , which has been refurbished and looks modern and neat . If you want 4 star a ##cco ##mo ##dation in the heart of Chicago , this hotel is just for you . It has a great location near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile Shopping Centre and there is no dear ##th of restaurants around the hotel . The taxi fare from the O ' ha ##re airport is around USD 45 / - which is quite affordable . The rooms are neat and the wash ##rooms well equipped . All the amenities such as electric k ##ett ##le , fridge etc are provided in the room , and there is a complementary breakfast offered ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great location . Walk to Mill ##eni ##um Park , Macy ' s State Street , River ##walk , and Dale ##y Plaza with Christ ##kind ##el Market . The suites in this hotel are f ##abulous with great views and amenities . Staff is nice and at ##ten ##tive . A very nice del ##uxe continental breakfast is included . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An older hotel with prices that don ' t match what you get . They are in ##line with other area hotels but it is the location you are paying for . They get top prices but I have stayed in way better places . Plus they let you park your car for + $ 50 / day . Stay in the ' b ##ur ##bs and U ##ber in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had never hear of the so ##fit ##el hotel before it was recommended by Trip ##A ##d ##visor . I loved the location of the hotel . On a quiet ##er street , it was easy walking distance to Hancock building , Michigan avenue , Water ##tower place and many great restaurants . The bathroom was sum ##pt ##uous ! The room itself was compact , but very com ##fy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic hotel close to heap ##s of places to eat and short walk to everything worth seeing in the Wind ##y City great bar with friendly staff always eager to help with any issue ( places to eat etc ) nice spacious rooms highly recommended [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved the re ##tro feel of the hotel , 1920s being on of my favourite decades meant this didn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Had a friendly welcome on arrival , our port ##er was very knowledge ##able . The hotel is located literally just off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . We walked to Navy Pier & Millennium Park from the hotel . We ate breakfast at the hotel one morning and it was delicious and filling ! The bedroom was quite small in comparison to other hotels in the US but then again this hotel was built in the 20 ' s . Good sized bathroom and lovely shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed at the Millennium for a reunion . The property is in an excellent location , with taste ##ful lobby and a better than average hotel bar we found to be a te ##rri ##fic gathering place . The fitness facility , while typically small , was impressive ##ly clean . The restaurant and service staff , however , were often dismiss ##ive and in ##att ##ent ##ive , and in one instance down right rude ( recommend you get morning coffee from cafe around the corner at the Hilton ) . There is no room service . But it ' s near the lake and walk ##able to key sites . So long as you don ' t have to interact with staff it is a convenient place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I absolutely loved this hotel ! Friendly staff helped with any and everything , and it has a great rate for the stay compared to other hotels . It is also in a great area with great food and places that are in walking distance . This hotel has a lot of character and feels like home . I was there on business , and I took an U ##ber ride to my conference hotel . It was well worth it . I preferred to stay at this hotel over the conference hotel any day . It had a very warm feel that did not remind you of business . I want bring my family back to stay here . You won ' t be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful ##ly located , modern rooms , great managers lounge and comfortable beds . My wife and I stayed here for a quick trip , not the largest rooms , but who stays in the rooms when you ' re a block from the Ma ##gni ##fica ##t Mile ? ! Friendly staff and plenty to do nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Whenever we attend the RS ##NA , we grab the opportunity to walk down the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and enjoy the fantastic shop windows in that f ##estive between Thanksgiving and Christmas . The weather is not the one you wish it to be , because of chill and wind but usually the international conferences are in that period . You can stop from time to time and warm yourself with a cup of coffee [UNK] or something to bite in multiple restaurants and cafe ##s . If only I had a chance to visit in another season ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] At the last minute we extended our stay by a day and picked the Conrad for our last evening . W ##H ##Y didn ' t we stay here all along , having been at the R ##itz . The Conrad gets way higher marks ! ! ! The staff was incredible . They greet you at the door , offer water when you check in , and if you have a question they will answer it . Our room was wonderful . The technology was neat , including the dark ##ening shades that are remote controlled and the master lighting system . I can ' t say enough things about this hotel and how great it was . Speaking of which , the bartender ##s were friendly , providing great service , Clay kept us entertained and we can ' t say enough good things about him ! We will clearly be back and ON ##L ##Y stay at the Conrad ! Thanks for treating us so well ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything but the bathroom size and lack of space for doing makeup / hair was fantastic at this hotel . Leah checked us in and was very persona ##ble and pleasant . Staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and offered more " I forgot " items than any other hotel I ' ve stayed in . Its a very well designed room but for my hub ##by who is 6 ' 5 and myself 5 ' 10 " things were very tight in the bathroom . I would consider staying in another room if more space is offered . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very pleasant stay . The hotel has a very great location . The staff is very welcoming ( especially the groom ##ers ) . The prestige suite is very spacious with a spectacular view . The food room service is very good despite the lack of choice . The breakfast in the hotel is excellent with very good quality products . Small flat , the restaurant is located at the entrance of the lobby and can be cold . The con ##cier ##ge is very friendly and will delight your request . A perfect stay , thanks to the So ##fit ##el quality ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great trip , rooms were nice and clean . Shuttle was close to the hotel . Food was very good , and the view was nice as well . I would stay there again . A little trouble getting a cab for dinner , but finally did . May want to U ##ber , I also did this and it worked out much better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ' t express my disappointment overall in this hotel . First , the positive : excellent work ##out area and nice breakfast area . Plus , the house ##keeping staff tried hard to clean , but the sheer volume it appeared they had to deal with per person made it difficult . The negative : dated rooms in poor condition , bathroom so small literally two people could not be in it at once , dated furniture , hallway ##s that may not have been updated in years , and a check - in process that gave a hint of what was to be expected as it took 45 minutes to do so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautifully appointed and has a great view of the river ! Plus you are close to lots of sites and attractions , the only down ##side is the elevators need more of them waited almost 20 minutes to head downstairs : ( [SEP]
1	[CLS] Michael Y is a great addition to the Swiss ##ote ##l restaurant / bar team , he is very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Service in the bar was excellent - re ##sp ##ons ##ive and friendly ! Remember ##ed my name and my drink each morning . Thank you Michael Y ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had not stayed in a Conrad hotel before . The hotel was in a great location , had friendly and helpful staff , great food , a great rooftop bar with a fantastic view , and great conference facilities . Room ##s are fantastic . I ' d stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great rooms and location right by subway stop so easy to get to W ##rig ##ley to see C ##ub ##bies win . Michigan Ave close by and easy to get around . Great view of W ##rig ##ley building and other great pieces of architecture from Lo ##bby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for business and loved this hotel . Great character , great food , and an outstanding staff in all areas . The location is walking distance to the lake front , and the rooms are very nice . You just can ' t go wrong staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is ideal in downtown Chicago . The hotel lobby is great , nice atmosphere . The rooms are spacious ( we had a del ##uxe suite ) with a nice view ( 23rd floor ) . Bed ##s E ##XT ##RA comfortable ! The con ##cier ##ge and reception ##ists are helpful and friendly . The breakfast is amazing : great past ##ries and I especially love the eggs Benedict ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I found this hotel online , never being in Chicago was concerned where to stay . Great location everything within walking distance . Navy Pier , magnificent mile , tour buses , shopping , park . Beautiful inside the hotel and very nice quiet rooms , except for city noises . We had a great view out our window . Breakfast is free and has eggs , bacon , wa ##ffles . Hi ##nt when parking get parking ##w ##hi ##z app and there is a parking garage behind on Ohio Street for $ 24 instead of the $ 50 they charge to v ##alet . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was extremely well located and an excellent value given the quality of the hotel . Room was large and comfortable . Staff was very professional . Will definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in February 2016 for a long weekend . We thought the hotel was very trend ##y and ch ##ic . We enjoyed the evening wine offering as well as the lobby bar . It was freezing that particular weekend so it was also nice to sit by the lobby fireplace . The staff was helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and sent a bottle of wine and some cheese to our room one night . The hotel is a great location and we would stay again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel and location were great . You can tell it is an older hotel but the art de ##co de ##cor is amazing . Some of the original details are still there . The hotel is close to some really great restaurants . I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wonderful hotel . Con ##sist ##ently delivers a positive experience . I have been going for years and the staff always welcome ##s me and remembers my name , Their new restaurant has delicious food , a little price ##y , but casual and fun . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is nice , and the staff were nice . The wedding we went to in the hotel was lovely . But in terms of the stay , some things are non - ne ##got ##iable for big city hotels . An elevator that actually gets your where you want to go is one of them . One elevator for 19 floors , each time it stopped 7 - 10 times , and took forever to arrive . And there is no way our bed was actually a queen as promised ( we have a queen at home , and this was smaller ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was wonderful ! All of the staff from the v ##alet , front desk and bar went above and beyond to make this stay enjoyable . I loved the atmosphere and design . The hotel was very clean and modern . I will stay here again . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Chicago is huge with lots of great places to stay . Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is smaller but one of the best stays we have ever had and we travel a lot . AL ##L staff is amazing . Take advantage of compliment ##ary happy hour . Pink the bartender is f ##abulous . House ##keeping is wonderful as is front desk . Only negative ##s - Show ##er is in a step in tub . Continental breakfast is a total miss B ##UT . This is ni ##t ##pic ##king . We had 8 people with four rooms ages 16 - 71 . Everyone L ##O ##VE ##D hotel location clean ##liness and comfort . If going to Chicago , stay here . Can ’ t beat it for location , comfort , staff , and price . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The TV was so far from the kind - sized bed that you couldn ' t watch it in bed . Our room was long and narrow . I was also told that I couldn ' t get points in the Joy of Life Club for my two night stay because of a technical ##ity . Ann ##oy ##ing . Bath ##room was nice and clean . We were on 4th floor and street noises ( garbage trucks , I think ) woke us up early on Sa ##t a . m . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel always adds a bit of luxury to my Chicago visits . Love the de ##cor , the level of service , the classic cocktail ##s and delicious food . The location is convenient for business travelers , but also well suited for ex ##cursions to the Art Institute , theaters , and parks . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was the first time my friends and I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel and we were so happy Arturo took such good care of us . Arturo made our check - in process very easy and was cheerful through out the whole process . He also explained to us about the Happy Hour the hotel offers , and he brought us some cute little wine bottles we had picked from the variety he offered from . Arturo made us feel delighted when we were around him , very nice hotel and excellent service ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly coming back soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel in a great location just a couple of blocks North of the loop at State and Ki ##nz ##ie . Nice continental breakfast . Good happy hour . Really have no complaints . We stayed on the 2nd floor which had a fair amount of street noise on the weekend . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay s ##t the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Perfect location . Close walk to so much . Room ##s are clean and spacious . Fun compliment ##ary hour hour and breakfast .

1	[CLS] Very clean room . All of the staff were court ##eous and friendly . The location is great - close to everything , It is only one block off Michigan Avenue . The food in the restaurant was very good . We will definitely come back for a future visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a wonderful stay at this hotel . I was booked at another hotel in the area but their workers were pick ##eting outside hotel . It was really noisy . Anyway I walked around and saw the O ##m ##ni Hotel . I ##ma was at the desk . She was wonderful . I told her my story and she said they had a room for me . It was a lovely room on the 19th floor . I loved it . Everyone was so nice and helpful and the bell ##man was really nice . I had a great three days in your city seeing Hamilton and Too ##ts ##ie and great meals . I will be staying here on my return to Chicago . Thank you [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed here during the co ##rona - virus pan ##de ##mic - this hotel is located almost directly on the miracle mile . They hotel staff is very friendly and helpful . Vale ##t parking is price ##y here , $ 76 . 00 a night but I believe you can book packages to include it , which we didn ' t . While I like the location of this hotel and the staff , the rooms have seen better days - with all the hotels in Chicago , we most likely will not return . We did enjoy our stay , we just want to see what else Chicago has to offer in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , service was awesome . Room ##s were clean , maid ##s cleaned when we we were out and did not interrupt us . The pool is very interesting and the work out room has plenty of machines and t ##read ##mill ##s [SEP]

The room had plenty of electrical plug ##s and charging ports . The desk was huge and easy to work at . The room also had a coffee maker and fridge , which I appreciated . I wished I could have stayed longer than one night and will definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Manager was able to upgrade our room view room to a room with an AM ##A ##Z ##ING VI ##E ##W of the city , suggested us one of the best steak ##houses in Chicago . Perfect place to have a romantic birthday experience . I will definitely be booking another stay at this hotel in the near future with my soon to be wife . [SEP]

1	[CLS] We visited during the strike but still had an awesome Hilton experience . They had limited house ##keeping staff and food service so certain amenities were unavailable but we are in Chicago with the most amazing food in the world ! Who cares about room service ? ! Hilton brought in employees from all over the country to keep the rest of the hotel functioning with the same outstanding quality I would expect . Steve , David , and R ##occo at the 720 bar treated us like royalty from the second we walked in along with the Hilton ’ s V ##aca ##tion specialist , Alex . All the hotels have striker ##s in front of them , not like it ’ s only this Hilton . This hotel is still worth the $ 450 a night , strike or no strike . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Custom ##er Service at check - in ( room floor upgrade / higher floor , upon request ) and also at check - out . Great Fitness Center ! ! ! - - I was told that it was recently re ##mo ##del ##ed / upgraded . Room was at the end of a corridor and very quiet . Excellent views ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , room and services were great . Super clean , had an awesome view , large bathroom . Super spacious . Service on the 14th floor ( food / drink ) was great . Wen ##t there first thing every morning for breakfast and coffee . Man ##dan ##a was one of the service people I interact ##ed with and she was amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No issues with my stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . The location was perfect and very easy to get around . Very clean rooms and spacious . The value was well worth the cost and was very accessible by foot or taxi . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . I appreciate having 2 rooms as well as a refrigerator . The staff was very helpful and there is a business center which was helpful as we suddenly realized we needed to print our tickets as the arena would not accept mobile ones . Having a compliment ##ary breakfast b ##uff ##et is great and a big money save ##r in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were on a 3 generation trip and rented two rooms . The grandparents had previously stayed here and enjoyed it . Prior to arrival we requested rooms near each other and a c ##ri ##b for our almost 2 year old . They took care of both . The suite set up was perfect for us . The hotel is nice but not too pre ##ten ##ti ##ous for traveling with kids . Great location to walk and see everything . Before vacation ##s I ’ m always searching reviews to find places that accommodate both adults and kids , and it ’ s not always easy to get info . High ##ly recommend this place if traveling with baby , to ##ddler , or kids ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the helpful staff ( they really go above and beyond to make your stay memorable ) to the amazing free happy hour and compliment ##ary coffee , tea and hot co ##coa bar in the a . m . , I wish I could live at the Hotel All ##egro . The Hot Todd ##y drink at happy hour was beyond delicious , and it was also fun to min ##gle with the other guests . The lobby and common spaces are so com ##fy and amazing and the rooms are com ##fy yet trend ##y . Kim ##pton Hotels are my favorite hotels to stay in , I love them all so much . Jo ##ining their loyalty program is a must ( you get lots of per ##ks , like a drink or raid - the - mini ##bar credits ) , plus being a member allows you to s ##na ##g rooms for $ 99 per night at properties like the All ##egro ! I ' m already planning another visit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great 2 - day stay at the Talbot ##t . A large , lovely room . Perfect location for us . Great service from all the staff , among them D ##wayne , who provided us with helpful tips and su ##gg ##eti ##ons . If we return to Chicago , we ##´ ##ll definitely try to return to the Talbot ##t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked our room last minute due to a new baby that was born in our family . The staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , the location is great , enjoyed the modern finishes and the beds are so comfortable ! Will def stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : Very central ##ly located ( across the street from river , 2 blocks from train ) , reasonably spacious room , clean and well - maintained furnishings , every single staff was wonderful & welcoming , super dog friendly , free w ##if ##i , 24 / 7 gym facilities , every room has a gorgeous bay window , great water pressure in shower Con ##s : Not sound - proof enough from hallway noise , lighting in bathroom could be stronger We had an encounter where the guest next door was being a n ##ui ##sance / aggressive , and when the hotel was alerted , they immediately moved us to another room . Hand ##led very well , very professionally . Overall , we were extremely happy with this hotel . Would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very satisfied with the cleaning and how up to date the rooms were ! The breakfast was okay , but I didn ’ t expect much since it ’ s bag ##ged . I wish you could have requested house keeping . Instead they give you products to clean on your own . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice clean hotel with classic but not dated interior . Staff is very friendly . Good coffee available in the mornings . Staff helped to become member of their reward program which allowed me a free upgrade to a larger room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . Dec ##ent room service . Supporting staff . Excellent location . In the heart of the city so no need to rent car . Everything is nearby . The staff was really helpful . They even checked us in earlier than usual check in time . Would love to stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Chicago O ##m ##ni is a very nice hotel in a great location . I recommend it . The rooms are reasonably spacious and there is a separate sitting room and bedroom . My 22 year old daughter and I had a 2 bed ##ded room that suited our purposes well . The 67 ##6 restaurant and bar is very nice . Everyone here works hard to make your time there feel special . I thought the room was very clean . The only q ##ui ##bble would be the lighting is poor . E ##asily re ##med ##ied with more lamps , especially bedside lamps - - - however , overall this is a very good property and at least this time of year , very reasonably priced for what you get . I highly recommend it and look forward to another visit soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What do we honestly want from a hotel ? A comfortable bed , everything in the room works as expected , and friendly service . The Kim ##pton All ##egro checks those things and more . My family and I a f ##abulous experience in Chicago recently and our accommodation ##s were a part . The service was outstanding ( we even received a couple of emails from the staff in ##qui ##ring on the room and service , that was a first for us ) . The room , though a little small , was comfortable , and you don ’ t need a masters degree in engineering to work the shower [UNK] . Would stay again and would recommend to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kay checked us in quickly and was friendly and very helpful . Kay was very up ##beat and helpful . The location can not be best . The Gold Coast has it all . Shopping and food . Quick walk or U ##ber to Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and 2 boys stayed at this hotel for 3 nights we upgraded to the club level which includes a continental breakfast and app ##eti ##zers ever night also free soft drinks and water all day ! ! The room was clean and the view was amazing . The hotel is right on the river ##walk close to many restaurants and shops parks and playground ##s . High ##ly recommend this hotel staff was wonderful super helpful ! Can ’ t say anything negative we didn ’ t try the pool or gym though . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at Ki ##nz ##ie hotel for the first time , but certainly not our last . The location was perfect , the hotel was beautiful , complementary breakfast on each floor and every staff member we interact ##ed with was friendly , but what really impressed both of us was the wonderful reception we received checking in with Robert . He was very welcoming and assisted us with getting a reservation for dinner , which he offered and was not even asked to do . Also , upon learning we were in Chicago to celebrate our anniversary he had a bottle of wine sent to our room . Robert was just the person we needed to meet after a horrible day of cancelled flights and lost baggage . I highly recommend staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything I could want in a downtown hotel . . . . views , convenience , f ##abulous restaurant , and well made cocktail ##s _ a great hotel for business or pleasure . My room overlooked the river , and I could easily access many restaurants , museums , and shopping options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a good time staying at the hotel . It ’ s very clean , the restaurant / bar is co ##zy and nice . D ##wayne was extremely friendly and helped us with transportation to the airport . High ##ly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is beautiful and convenient to everything . You are just a block away from delicious food . Eat ##aly is just down the street and was f ##abulous . We walked to R ##PM and had a f ##abulous dinner took a 20 minute taxi ride to the United Center for a concert [SEP]
1	[CLS] I planned a 24 trip to visit my daughter and booked a room at the All ##egro . En ##tering from the street and walking up the decorated staircase into the Art Dec ##o lobby was lovely . The staff were friendly and professional seeking to accommodate needs . The rooms were comfortable and well appointed . The hand ##ica ##p accessible bathroom was much appreciated by my daughter . With the superb staff , great accommodation ##s and location , we ' ll return . Oh , and did I mention we were met with a glass of champagne having arrived during happy hour ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Your staff were exceptional as always . There was always someone to ask for directions and to help with all your needs . Everett Yo ##ku ##m from parking and v ##alet was very helpful with the parking and re ##tri ##ev ##ing our vehicle . Like I said before your employees are exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the second time I spent days in this hotel . . . the hotel is very nice , old but nice , elevators works funny but are ok , food I think could be better however , I have that feeling at the moment of check in that I didn ’ t feel comfortable . . . they don ’ t even look at you ! . . . kind of weird sensation , not friendly like in a rush . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful stay on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! Great location , excellent service , and beautiful room . Would definitely stay again . Getting to all of our destinations was very easy , as we were right in the middle of it all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived in Chicago after taking the overnight train from New York . What a pleasure to walk into our hotel room which was quiet and had the most comfortable bed , which we needed after night spent on the train . The staff were very friendly and helpful , the 5 o ' clock drinks in the F ##oy ##er was a lovely way to start the evening . The location was excellent , walking distance to major attractions . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved early but checked in quickly . Nice room with nice view . Clean com ##fy bed and room . Coffee in room is so nice . Shuttle to boat show was great , both there and back . Great weekend with friends . Reason ##able price also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Found out on Monday June 3rd we could not go , because of work . Could not cancel or get any re ##fu ##nd at all because it was after June 1st . Very disappointed . We were going there for the blues festival and it would have EA ##SI ##L ##Y booked up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very positive experience as a Hilton Diamond Honors member . The usual free water , and the staff member handling my check ##in was ass ##id ##uous in pointing out all of the amenities available to me at their property as a Diamond . Got a free room upgrade . Room was clean , linen ##s were excellent , no particular signs of wear on furnishings or bathroom furniture . W ##if ##i was fast . Some of these reviewers seem to have encountered worn elements in their rooms but I saw no sign of that myself . Great stay at a good price for a random trip to Chicago downtown with plenty of good places to eat in the immediate area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed in to this hotel last week from out of town and the clerk Kenya have a awesome attitude and very helpful . Any questions I asked she was able to answer instead of telling me she don ' t know . Thanks again [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is central ##ly located in the heart of shops and delicious restaurants . The staff were extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , even to the point of hand delivering our room a microwave when I merely joked about wanting to heat up our left ##over Lou ’ s pizza the next day . The bartender , con ##cier ##ge , front desk , and cleaning staff were super nice . The door ##man , D ##wayne , was super knowledge ##able about the area and warmly greeted us each morning as if we were old friends . The only thing my wife and I found to be a little weird , was the hotel not having a “ Do Not Di ##st ##ur ##b ” signs for the rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located , nice interiors , very nice rooms . Called for a late check ##out and they didn ’ t think a second to extend the courtesy . It ’ s 1 block to Mill ##eni ##um Park and Michigan Avenue and You can reach it through the River ##walk . If you are taking an U ##ber you should request it for ‘ The Palm ’ ( the hotel restaurant ) , and not for ‘ Swiss ##hot ##el ’ . Otherwise drivers get lost . Great value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wanted to stay at a historic hotel during Christmas and was disappointed . The hotel lobby bar was gorgeous . Large tree and live violinist ##s . That was the end of the f ##estive atmosphere . The King size room was small and the bathroom was even smaller . Potter ##s bar was average at best . The highlight of the stay was the bell man who took our luggage across the street to the parking garage . Better places for the same price point in ch ##ica ##go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They over promised and gross ##ly under ##del ##iver ##ed . The Guest Services Manager , in his reply to my multiple issues ( wrong rooms , wrong rates , mysterious charges on my bill , etc . ) , said , " This hotel is in a season of transition . . . " Good luck with that . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel prices in downtown Chicago have sky ##rock ##eted making many of the big name chains totally un ##af ##ford ##able . So on a recent trip I stayed here instead of my usual choices . I remembered an older conservative hotel , and was pleasant ##ly surprised that the hotel had been totally re ##cre ##ated as a ch ##ic bout ##ique hotel . It was modern , clean , and very well run . The restaurant was very good although it has a somewhat limited menu . You cannot beat the location on a side street off Michigan Ave . Many restaurants are within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Probably the worst Hilton I have ever stayed in . Extreme ##ly over ##p ##rice ##d for a tiny room that is worn and out ##dated . The elevators were so der ##eli ##ct that the hotel started letting us use their service elevators . This is a historical hotel but it ’ s long over ##due for a total re ##mo ##del . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had the friend ##liest , fastest and smooth ##est check - in with Shin ##ita . Connie and Rene are so friendly and at ##ten ##tive and effort ##lessly managed over 150 guests in the 30 + minutes we were in the SP ##G lounge . Connie and Rene greet every guest and make everyone feel valued and like an extended family . We ended our stay with a perfect drink mixed by Juan at the bar . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our stay was wonderful . We enjoyed your beds and your views . As well as the large TV . The weather was wonderful and we ventured out . But had the weather been a challenge we would have love staying in . My only complaint was the single “ e ##jection ” chair in the room . Please sit in it and lean forward just a little and it falls toward . You may want to re ##con ##side ##r as someone can get hurt hitting the table . Luckily the couch gave us plenty of seating when we ordered room service . The service was spot on . We were very please with our stay . And thank you for unlimited free bottle ##d water . It was much appreciated ! Very f ##abulous hotel ! We would definitely stay there again . Lots of shops and restaurants around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My conference was at the Mar ##riot ##t 2 blocks away . The Conrad was the over ##flow hotel as the Mar ##riot ##t was full . What a nice surprise . For the same price as the Mar ##riot ##t , the Conrad provided a much more luxurious experience . Large well lit bathroom with walk in shower and large van ##ity with double sink . P ##lent ##y of storage space . Lots of lighting options , push button window treatments , very friendly staff . N ##es ##press ##o machine with compliment ##ary coffee , tea , cream ##er and unlimited water bottles . Also a pot to make hot water for tea . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Did not like the hotel . G ##rump ##y check in staff - so much for being a SP ##G gold . No points given because my company was paying the bill . Food was lo ##us ##y . Bar expensive with limited choices - though at least the bar staff were friendly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great Hotel ! Wonderful staff that are very welcoming and warm . I look forward to staying at he O ##m ##ni again . Thank you for a enjoyable b ##sui ##ness trip ! his was my first trip to Chicago . The bell staff were quick to offer directions , core ##ct directions too ! They helped me grab a quick bite to eat at a real Chicago hot spot . The bar was lively and had great service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at So ##fit ##el , mainly cause it showed good price & quality deal . It was a great location , just over 150 $ . We found the staff very friendly , the location was awesome . Very good breakfast ! Good size rooms . What else can u ask for in downtown Chicago . . [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended a yearly convention locally this year . Dec ##ided to stay instead of battling the traffic back and forth every day . From the time I arrived , I was treated so kindly . From the at ##ten ##tive v ##alet , to check in with a compliment ##ary upgrade and the house ##keeping staff that welcomed me and wished me well , I had a great stay . My room had a great view of the Chicago River and Sky ##line . I spent most of my time sitting in a chair near the window enjoying the sites . The room was on the price ##y side , but I was made to feel special . The meeting rooms were large and the chairs comfortable . I would recommend this for any business or special occasion . Thank you ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great location within walking distance to E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING that Chicago has to offer . We were pleased with hotel but did few it had a corporate feel to it as it had business events going on most days . Overall enjoyable and comfortable but not W ##OW [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Kick ##er ##bo ##cker from work . The staff was very friendly and the room was clean and nice . The location was near the Chicago 360 observatory and was very convenient ##ly located . The room I got was large and I had all the things I needed to work effectively . The only down ##side was the con ##cier ##ge which booked an incorrect show for me which I booked myself later with T ##ick ##et ##M ##aster . The bar was decent and the area is nice although not within the loop area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for six nights for a conference and family visit . This building gives off the feel of quiet and solid ##ity ; you don ' t hear heating and p ##lum ##bing noises . The room was very comfortable and big enough for two , though without extra space . The service was friendly without being in ##tr ##usive . The location is the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ; from the point of view of transit , this has its plus ##es ( lots of buses on Michigan Ave . ) and a minus ( half mile to the nearest " L " stop ) . I was paying a convention rate : the cost was appropriate for this area , which means that , by my standards at least , it is a bit on the high side . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed two nights at the Fair ##mont recently for work and selected the hotel primarily because it had an underground connector to the A ##ON Center where my meetings were . I also scored a great room rate of $ 147 though some of my colleagues who booked later had to pay $ 29 ##9 . The lobby was beautiful and the room was fine though nothing special . One odd thing is that my room seemed to be being used for storage as there was a folded roll ##away bed and a fan s ##tas ##hed in the corner . I had a room service breakfast one morning that was delicious and arrived at 7 : 30 on the dot , the exact time I requested . Overall a convenient place to stay if you have business near the A ##ON center , but nothing out of the ordinary . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I make a yearly trip to Chicago every spring for a professional meeting . My go - to location is Swiss ##ote ##l on W ##ack ##er . The hotel is beautiful and is in a great location . Several of the areas have been renovated . The fitness room , located on the 43 ##rd floor , has a spectacular view of the lake and Navy P ##eer . Meeting rooms are con ##du ##ci ##ve for business meetings , and the rooms and staff are excellent . I ' ve been at this hotel at least 4 - 5 times and it never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Not only is the hotel GO ##R ##GE ##O ##US and in an amazing location , but we were welcomed by the wonderful I ##rvin who kicked our trip off with the best recommendations and smile after a long travel day . Will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] First of all , I spend more than 100 nights per year in hotels across the U . S . The Conrad Chicago is one of the best . By comparison , I stayed in Chicago a month ago at lower tier Hilton hotel . The room was 1 / 4 the size and the rate was higher . From the moment I checked into the Conrad until the time I checked out , my entire family was treated to first - class customer service . The hotel is new , clean and spacious with all of the amenities . It is also in a quite and convenient location for getting most anywhere in the city . If I wanted an extra pillow , a fan , extra towels or more s ##ham ##po ##o , all I had to do was send a text and it was delivered or promptly . It was clean and beautifully decorated . I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to my nest stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room didn ' t look like anything in the pictures posted here . The room I originally had was super small . They were kind enough to upgrade me to the executive level but it appears that the standard bed is a full not a queen . Service was hit or miss - sometimes awesome sometimes not great . They upgrade was wonderful but I had asked for extra blanket two nights in a row and it never arrived either night . Great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for family get - away . Staff is friendly and helpful . Very expensive for what it is though . The room was clean enough , only issue was there was previous occupants stuff left in the fridge . [SEP]
1	[CLS] rooms seem to be 20 or 30 years old in terms of decoration however they are large tiny safe in the closet ( you cannot keep a laptop in it ) bath ##robe but no slip ##pers iron and table in the small closet went there for business with colleagues every one of us had problems with water : cold water in the shower unless you let it flow for a few minutes everything is a little old fashion in March nearly no one at the hotel empty lobby empty bar had a problem when checking out : we had been paying rooms in advance in order to save time however the employee had no knowledge about it and we had to wait and discuss but were not heard however everyone at breakfast room attendant ##s and employees were nice nice views on the town or navy pier [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ies is a great place to stay at right in the center of Chicago , near to the river and with loads of good restaurants and pubs around it . It ' s quite modern ##ly furnished and offers many amenities like a safe for your belongings and a in - house fitness center . It ' s been very clean with very helpful staff . Only thing that ' s been really terrible was the so called " continental breakfast " - who made this up has clearly never seen " the continent " . It just doesn ' t fit for such an otherwise ##ly really nice place to offer guests plastic cut ##ler ##y and dishes to eat artificial things with that I ' d barely would describe as food . With a decent breakfast it would have been a perfect stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted here for a recent conference . Such a beautiful hotel with so much history . Staff was very professional and friendly . Room ##s very clean . Lots of conference rooms . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located right on Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel experience . The front desk employees were amazing . I dealt with Co ##di ' and Mike . This is also a great location . The price is also fair . I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend . Excellent experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] hotel M ##US ##T realize house ##keeping is M ##OS ##T important to guests . there were carpet / room clean ##liness issues along with stained linen ##s ! ! !

1	[CLS] The room is small , rest ##room is small and no hair dry ##er . The entire floor is party ##ing . I called 2 times to finally get the hair dry ##er . No slip ##pers are provided , they said due to fire code regulations . . sounds strange to me . If you want to park your cars around the hotel , you can park across the streets , ( paid parking lot ) it will save you around $ 25 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every staff person that I had interactions with were super friendly and extremely helpful ! Breakfast was great and the service was first class . I needed to find an off property place to meet a client for lunch and the staff at the bell desk could not have nice ##r ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . Reason ##able in price . Clean and nice . Great staff . Had no problems whatsoever . D ##wayne was definitely a top performer and very persona ##ble . Great location for sights ##ee ##ing , food , shopping . Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Making it simple . . . Po ##sitive : Location , Si ##ze of Room ##s , New Fu ##rn ##iture , Has Heat ##ed Indoor Pool , Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary Breakfast . N ##eg ##ative : Park ##ing Price ( $ 60 / day ) and Service ( allow 30 min . to get your car ) ; El ##eva ##tors will take as much as car to arrive ; Breakfast will take same amount of time so that you get a seat . Still , I do recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with a few friends for a girls weekend . It was a little expensive , but for Chicago on the weekend that is to be expected . The rooms were updated and had charming details and a g ##lam ##orous look . The beds were comfortable , and the rooms were clean . The bathroom ##s were big and had nice shower heads . If I had the money I would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly , inform ##ative and polite staff . Made check ##out and check ##in very smooth . Con ##ven ##ient to everything we wanted to do . Only problem we had was a non working outlet , found out the next morning when our phones didn ' t work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had all - around excellent experience . The check - in was literally the quick ##est and e ##asi ##est we ' ve ever experienced and we have many hotels to compare it to . The room was large and comfortable with plenty of counter space in the bathroom . That seems to be lacking in too many hotels , per my wife . Room service was quick and good , although the cap ##pu ##cci ##no on our second morning was w ##oe ##fully disappointing . Aside from that , no issues and would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s not the R ##itz , but the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker was perfect for us ! Great location . Great price . Super service . Located across the street from the Drake , the hotel felt very " Chicago " to us . We didn ' t eat here , so I can ' t speak to restaurants . Bed ##s were comfortable . Room was clean . The shower is a little weird - water wasn ' t kept inside the stall . For what we saved over other nearby choices , we couldn ' t have been happier ! Book directly through their site for free w ##i fi [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the front desk to the Con ##cier ##ge to the Bell Station - everyone I encountered was very friendly and helpful . The room was beautiful with a com ##fy bed and a couch to sit and read on ! Bath ##room had lots of little extra ##s ( cotton balls , em ##ery board , face wipe ##s , etc ) that were unexpected . Nice work ##out room and equipment . Then there was the pool ! Soo ##oo pretty ! Water temperature was good - not too hot , not too cold . Hotel was close to shopping , G ##hir ##ard ##elli Ice Cream and chocolate a block away , close to boat rides ( Architectural Tour is a must ) . Also walked to Navy Pier , though its a little far for some to walk . Also not far from train line . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall excellent experience , children enjoyed and everything was very accessible . Pit ##y we found a hair clip in the bathroom and P ##ring ##les had already being open . Front door staff were all excellent . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything from the staff , the detailed de ##cor and the amenities was perfect ! Would recommend to any family or friend traveling to the wind ##y city ! They take care of their guests no matter the situation ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was very old I usually steer clear of older hotels because I don ’ t like old and haunted . For my first older hotel this one was very nice ! The rooms were very spacious but the beds were very small it was a tight squeeze for me and my husband . We didn ’ t have a view of anything but a a wall but the walls are very thick we were right across from the elevators and we never heard a sound ! This hotel is right off Michigan a ##ve with all of the best shopping around ! It ’ s also very close to the Hancock building where you can see the whole city from the 96 ##th floor ! We were only in the city for 2 days so we will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an excellent hotel in a perfect location . Room was fully functional and provided for good rest . Location is close to great restaurants and shops . Service is friendly and efficient . Check - in and check - out were very smooth and fast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great time . The lake view room was spectacular . The room was clean with a large wash ##room and big screen TV . The rooms were quiet . The fitness room had more card ##io and weight machines than any other hotel I ' ve visited , lots of dumb ##bell ##s too , and offered Granny Smith applies and lemon and cu ##cum ##ber water . Very nice ! It was clean and well kept . The staff were great . In particular our hostess Ruth gave us all the information we needed , recommended a great restaurant and ensured we found our way around town . Outstanding and at ##ten ##tive service with a smile ! You can always find a good hotel , but I would come back just for the great service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Previously stayed at the Pa ##lo ##mar in Chicago but the Monaco had a better rate this time . En ##joy ##ed our time here . The hotel is less bout ##ique than the Pa ##lo ##mar but the double queen room was nice size and views were excellent from the cushion ##ed window seats . Everyone slept well until the " L " fired up for the morning commuter ##s , but any hotel located close to the rail will hear the s ##cre ##ech ##ing noise of the train wheels . Park ##ing is very expensive at $ 58 per night but there are no less expensive options unless you park outside the city . Some adjacent hotels charge a little more . Overall great value if you want to stay in the heart of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 1 night only for business m ##t ##g on my way to Detroit . Got an upgrade to a grand suite as a black member . However , they did not have my preferences right ( as usual ) , and had a bowl of fruit rather than red wine waiting for me in the room . How difficult can it be to read my profile correct before I arrive ? That being said the suite was really nice and comfort of the bed was great . As I had a breakfast meeting a couple of blocks away ( Te ##mpo Cafe ) I did not try breakfast . There was a bell boy at the hotel upon arrival , but no offer to help with my luggage . Well , that saved me 5 bucks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Since ##re , hard working people at the front desk and at the door , free cookies / coffee at the reception ( fun Black ##hawks - themed dough ##nut ##s on the game day ) , happy hour with drinks and finger food , spot ##lessly clean and spacious room , nice bathroom . Breakfast served on each floor - there is a tray in the room . Lo ##ad it up with past ##ries , cereal , coffee , juice , yo ##gu ##rt , etc . , take it to your room and enjoy breakfast in bed . They let me check in 4 hours early with no extra fees . Also , after I checked out they stored my luggage free of charge until late afternoon . Ki ##nz ##ie ' s location couldn ' t be any better ! Don ' t expect any fancy f ##rill ##s , luxury , or great views . But if you are looking for an honest hotel where you get solid service for your money , you can ' t go wrong with Ki ##nz ##ie . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed here 10 or so times now since I visit Chicago a lot . There is nothing horrible about the hotel , it has just become very run down . The elevator today had the call box door broken and hanging open . The carpet ##s in the rooms are worn , and there are s ##cu ##ffed walls everywhere . You can see the photo of my room . It looks like a roads ##ide inn . The people are lovely and friendly , and it is in a great location . Just don ’ t kid yourself that this is a luxury hotel . It is far from it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing lobby area with restaurants and shops located inside the building . I went to the Star ##bu ##cks every morning . Con ##ven ##ient location within walking distance of Ma ##g Mile . Room ##s were small , but nice . The history of the building is really neat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I found this hotel online and thought it looked cute - it was better than cute ! The rooms were up to date , yet the hotel has an amazing history that cannot be denied and has been beautifully integrated with every modern convenience . I cannot single out anyone on the staff , as everyone from the bell men to the front desk clerk ##s to the bartender ##s went above and beyond ! ! I stayed at two other hotels during my time in Chicago , but the Ambassador was my favorite ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the hotel were amazing . They were friendly , pro ##active and efficient . I appreciated that the hotel was kid - friendly and that the staff treated my children kindly and not like they were a burden as guests . In fact , my son dropped his favorite toy down the elevator shaft and the bell ##man retrieved it for him and sent it to our home in M ##N . We could not have asked for a better experience and I am thankful that we chose the O ##m ##ni in Chicago as our destination to spend Mother ' s Day weekend . Please give the staff our sincere ##st thank you and we will definitely recommend this to others that want a magnificent hotel experience in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the rooms , friendly helpful staff , con ##cier ##ge was really great . definitely recommend ! ! ! The rooms are really large and love the stone tile in the bathroom . Such a great value for the money in January . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The location was perfect . I think the bed was the most heavenly I have ever found while traveling . The food was delicious and exquisite ##ly presented ; I loved receiving an orchid with room service . Would highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pre ##pa ##id reservation for 2 rooms made over a month in advance . At check in - they took one half of the group , signed them in and sent them up , and only then told us the second room was not available and the other half of the group was to be shipped across town . The excuse off ##hand ##edly offered was that they experienced lots of booking ##s the previous week . That is unacceptable as our rooms were pre ##pa ##id and no notice was given via email or phone of their intent not to honor our reservations . Des ##k staff passive aggressive . Sub ##st ##it ##ute hotel dated , two beds not one , and terribly in ##con ##ven ##ient as we now have to travel back across town to meet up with our group in the AM , . Never again - ever . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our daughter was flying in from Seattle and thanks to Amber ##ose and Jason f ##ax ##ing the credit card authorization form and taking care of things on their end she was able to check in by 9 ##am after a long overnight flight . When we arrived later that night Amber ##ose greeted us and made us feel very welcome . She is an asset to your hotel . The room was fantastic , the view was great from the 17th floor . We will definitely stay here again . The v ##alet parking made things very easy for us . Breakfast was great also , hot and lots to choose from . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Classic Michigan Avenue hotel located just north of the Chicago River . Even if you don ' t swim , make sure you take a moment to see the beautiful , ornate ##ly designed swimming pool , unlike any other I ' ve ever seen . Room ##s are nicely finished , decent ##ly sized , clean and well maintained . Only complaint would be that what they call queen - sized beds are really more double - sized . Michael Jordan ' s St ##eak ##house is on site , as is a Star ##bu ##cks . Staff is friendly and professional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very spacious and comfortable room with modern furniture and a king size bed . Room temperature was very easy to set . Perfect ##ly clean room and bathroom with a generous selection of toilet ##ries . Modern and functional the congress centre . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent hotel with remarkable customer service . From the moment we walked in until check out we received excellent service . It was my daughter ' s birthday and she was thrilled when we returned from our cruise and a birthday cake and personal birthday card was waiting for her . My family had a wonderful time and my daughter is already asking to go back . Great location to enjoy all that Chicago has to offer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister and I recently attended a conference that was hosted at the Hotel Monaco . The hotel is well situated just a few steps from Michigan Avenue . The staff were friendly , helpful and just nice people . The daily wine happy hour at 5 ##pm was a highlight - a chance to un ##wind as each day turned to night . We upgraded to a higher floor and were delighted with corner room # 120 ##2 - ask for it if you can ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a long weekend while in town for a trade show and brought the family . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and with my Hilton Honors gave us a nice ##r corner room upgrade . The views were good and the room recently re ##mo ##dell ##ed , clean and comfortable . On site dining options were good , but room service selection is very limited . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed in a suite at the kin ##zie over the holidays and were blown away with the entire experience . The door ##men were excellent . Drake , Melissa , and G ##es ##mer ##ait went above and beyond all expectations to ensure every single need we had was met . Our room was amazing and the house ##keeping staff ensured everything was cleaned and rest ##ock ##ed . Will be booking again this spring . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay at the Palmer House . Building is beautiful and rooms are clean and updated considering the age of the building . Nice beds , pillows and towels . A block from C ##IB ##C Theatre making an easy walk without coats to see Hamilton and only a couple blocks to the Bean and Art Institute . Only complaint was our room overlooking a roof construction site next door with workers that started at 7 am ( banging on metal beams ) . I wish we had been informed of that possibility and given the option of a different side of building at check in . Don ' t forget to consider parking costs ( $ 47 across street $ 85 v ##alet ) when booking room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This used to be the Am ##al ##fi hotel . It is central ##ly located downtown and has a very trend ##y motif . We got lucky and got a corner room that had an amazing view with giant windows , a big ch ##ais ##e lounge , and interesting modern de ##cor . Our view was of various sky ##scraper ##s and the street . There is an unique feature of cold continental breakfast on every floor . There is an empty refrigerator . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , clean rooms and decent service . We paid for a " city view " room so we could see the " Chicago sky ##line " and though we were on the 19th floor and we ' re ambassador club members the view was a disappointment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location and f ##abulous service in the bar and in the restaurant . Excellent Weekend br ##unch , very nice late night snack ##s in the bar . Stay ##ed in one of the newly re ##mo ##del ##ed rooms - 32nd . floor . Nice view , nice room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I spent the night of July 8 at the Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park and was delighted with every aspect of my stay . I arrived quite early in the morning and , to my very pleasant surprise , my room was ready . The room itself was spot ##lessly clean and well appointed . The price was good and , given the hotel ' s convenient location , I consider it a very good value . I look forward to another visit there soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every December / holiday break we stay a weekend with our boys , ages 6 and 8 . Great location , can walk to a lot - like the Ma ##g Mile . And easy access to a bus stop , if going to A ##qua ##rium or museums . The hotel is always clean and inviting ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice enough hotel in a great location if you are on foot exploring Chicago . I stayed here in a double queen room with husband and two teens in a larger room with space for a t ##run ##dle bed . Two things were lacking for us . There were no glasses in the room for drinking water . I called the front desk to ask and they said they took out the glasses because there ' s no in - room dining anymore . Hmm ##m . . . what about in - room drinking of water and in - room brushing of teeth ? Again , very odd . There are paper cups for coffee so there you go . Get more . I could see where they ripped the small fridge out of the cabinet . Anyone traveling with family knows this is a prime am ##eni ##ty so that was disappointing . But there are nice bars and a restaurant here so that ' s convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] a great place to come home to - the gold floor lounge spoiled my 4 year old granddaughter rotten ; the con ##cier ##e in the lounge was extremely helpful and knowledge ##able with reservations and best times to go to the different venues - nice ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great time in downtown Chicago with a large group of friends . En ##joy ##ed our stay at the H ##ya ##tt Regency . The check - in / out process was incredibly easy , breakfast b ##uff ##et exceeded expectations , all hotel personnel were efficient and professional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] lovely hotel rooms spacious good breakfast , location was fantastic as we wanted to be close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for shopping ! Would go back again the next time i ' m visiting . Room was clean and beds great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was very nice with a beautiful view ! The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby ! I usually have to request a shower cap from con ##cier ##ge but there was one already in the bathroom as well as many other great a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tive items . I also really loved the Michael Jordan St ##eak ##house and Bar downstairs . Overall great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] On May 12th 2018 we hosted our High Schools Senior Pro ##m . Veronica the sales manager made everything smooth and event ##ful . The students had a wonderful time ! The are still talking about it . We are booking again for 2019 . Amazing experience . Amazing professional Staff ! ! ! Ace ##s all around ! Thank you Veronica and the Swiss Team for an event ##ful Evening . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you want a nice place to stay with the most friendly staff in Chicago than The Ki ##nz ##ie is it ! Starting with the v ##alet and all the way through the front desk and cleaning staff , everyone was cheer ##y and helpful . I think the bartender was the only person having a bad day . Even then he was not un ##friend ##ly , just down to business . No g ##litz or g ##lamour at the Ki ##nz ##ie . Just a nice , clean , affordable stay . Everything seemed updated and new . We have nothing to give a negative review on . If your looking for spectacular views of Chicago go elsewhere , only 6 floors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We hosted our daughter ' s wedding at the hotel . Our contact was Chris . He was recommended to us by a neighbor that had both of their daughter ' s wedding receptions here . We were extremely pleased on the quality of the experience . Chris and his staff are top notch , experienced professionals . No detail was missed . I highly recommend Chris and this hotel for a wonderful wedding . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing , great friendly staff always more than happy to help and advise things to do . Very clean . Great amenities and free w ##if ##i . Bar was great with wide range of cocktail ##s and wines . Love ##d this hotel would definitely book again . Perfect ##ly central to get about the city as well . Always a cab outside as well . Big thumbs up [UNK] also very reasonable [SEP]
0	[CLS] The property is very clean and comfortable . The hotel is business friendly while at the same time makes you feel like your on vacation . The staff is top notch from the front desk to house ##keeping . Don ' t be afraid to try the food at the hotel restaurant . You will be pleasant ##ly surprised [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for three days on business and will stay again in the future . Hotel staff was great to work with from check in to check out . I really appreciated seeing a diverse and professional work environment throughout the hotel . I especially enjoyed meeting and speaking with Curtis Carter , Ex ##pert S ##hoe Shine ##r who has been working at the hotel for over 30 years . Best shine in the city by far . My room was nice but the view is what made it as I was overlooking Grant Park / Michigan Ave / Lake Michigan . There is a rental bike stand right across the street from the hotel which I do recommend rent ##ing a bike and riding over to Buckingham Fountain which was also view ##able from my room . This hotel is probably not the best option if you are on a tight budget but what full service Hilton is . : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker certainly has charm . A side effect of its relatively old age is that the rooms are small , but mine was adequately appointed if somewhat basic . The bathroom was modern and clean . The breakfast offering is relatively basic but pass ##able . The location is ok for downtown . On average I might try somewhere else next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is perfectly located in the city center , walking distance to main attractions . Lower levels rooms can be noisy from near by traffic . But on high floors is quiet enough . Good bar for late drinks . Con ##cier ##ge is very useful if you need it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great location . The check - in woman was a bit rude , despite me being a Hilton Honors Gold member . We had 3 rooms reserved and she kept referring to " both " rooms . When I asked for c ##lar ##ification , making sure they had 3 rooms for us , she became unpleasant . She also kept referring to " THE queen room " , when we had 2 rooms with 2 queen beds and a room with 2 full beds . When we checked out , they had charged us 2 different rates for the 2 queen rooms ( each with 2 people ) and they couldn ' t figure out why and wouldn ' t fix it . They pawn ##ed me off on a 1 - 800 number . The location is great , the rooms were fine ; it was nice that they had mini fridge ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was a little nervous about traveling during the pan ##de ##mic , but Gretchen Mi ##tz made it all worth ##while . Not only was she warm , friendly , and welcoming . . but had answers to ever question asked . P ##LE ##AS ##E . . . . . . make sure she is rewarded in some form . She truly goes above and beyond the call of duty . Thank you Gretchen for making my stay . . . . ME ##MO ##RA ##BL ##E . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie was a great place for our Chicago stay . Everything is modern and clean . The rooms were light filled and very comfortable . The hotel is just two blocks from Michigan Avenue , near the Du ##S ##able Bridge so it was easy walking to places on both sides of the Michigan River . We self - parked for $ 52 a day just 1 / 2 block away . Our stay included a free drink in the evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great spot in a great location . Super friendly staff - one gentleman - D ##wayne - suggested some fan ##atic local restaurants and easy things to do with our two to ##ddler ##s that turned out to be highlights . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago during a visit in early February . The staff was great , the rooms were clean , and both P ##ump Room and Library Bar were te ##rri ##fic . The quality of the included breakfast left a little to be desired , but it was convenient so no real complaints . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The renovated Home ##wood Suite ##s is the perfect place to stay and in a central location . I upgraded to a corner room and loved watching the city get dark below me . The room was very clean . I enjoyed the Thursday social hour and breakfast . The bell hop ##s were helpful and pleasant . I could walk the magnificent mile and the park . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in a superior king room over the week - the hotel is located in a prime location ! We pretty much walked everywhere we needed to go , 25 min walk was probably the longest we had . The location made the trip ideal and very easy . The hotel itself is very nice - the service is 5 stars - from beginning to end . The rooms are clean and nice and have everything I think you need . The beds are extremely comfortable . Had an amazing time , highly recommend and cannot wait to return one day ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Si ##mp ##ly the finest accommodation ##s on Chicago ' s famed Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . High ##ly recommended . Close to all major downtown attractions , including Navy Pier and the Art Institute of Chicago . Easy access to the L and W ##rig ##ley ##ville . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super nice door ##men . Great location , very safe area . The rooms are small and could use some up ##dating . But I would certainly stay here again . The bar has a great selection of drinks , one night they even had someone playing the piano , which was nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was renovated since I last visited . It is in a great location and the hotel is clean and modern . However , everything else stays same , such as extremely slow w ##if ##i ( even with w ##if ##i boost ##er ) , below average breakfast and me ##dio ##cre night special . We probably won ' t come back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ##m not the type of person to leave bad reviews but after this experience I have no choice . So not only did we spend 45 trying to find the place via Google maps ( because navigation cuts out underground ) front des ##t had zero s ##ym ##pt ##oma ##thy the Ice machine situation reminds of a 1 star motel check p ##ics . Clean ##ing service was non exist ##ent was non exist ##ent . So many better options magnificent mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was our first time in Chicago and the hotel was well located . Very close of everything : Chicago theater , the river , millennium park , magnificent mile . A lot restaurants around . The staff super friendly . We enjoyed . ! [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently recommended this hotel to important clients and Boy did they make us look good ! From the minute they walked into the front door they were treated like royalty . The front desk staff in particular was enthusiastic and professional . Our clients loved the breakfast , the cocktail reception , their room and the whole experience . I will continue to recommend the Ki ##nz ##ie again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My Wife and I celebrate our Wedding Anniversary every year at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago . The People are Wonderful and Shu ##la ' s St ##eak ##house is te ##rri ##fic ! ! Our Room is Always Clean and the Bed ##ding is Great as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great staff , beautiful views , and great breakfast . Can ' t go wrong ! We booked one night and then stayed another because we had such a good time . When booking , stay in a premium suite because you get snack ##s and re ##f ##resh ##ments . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I reserved a two room executive suite this past weekend . Unfortunately , the room was taken out of service and no other two rooms were available . Joshua , the front desk assistant was wonderful and went in the back to talk to management and we were upgrade to a two floor suite . What a pleasant experience . He was not only helpful but wonderful person to talk to . High ##ly recommend this hotel and ask for Joshua . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I were in Chicago with two of our young grandson ##s visiting my aged aunt who lived a few blocks away . There was a mix - up in our reservations . We thought we had reserved an additional night , but the hotel , for whatever reason , did not have a record of that room reservation . Even though it was a B ##US ##Y weekend with the Black ##hawks Convention , Sean and Julius worked it out . The demand for rooms was was extreme , but our extra night was the same price as our previous three nights . We were able to spend time with my aunt before heading home . Thank you , Sean and Julius ! Your efforts meant a lot to us ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I used to live in Chicago , so love that when I get to visit for work , I found such a great spot ! The hotel is absolutely lovely , the bed incredibly comfortable , the rooms beautiful , the staff wonderful , and the food delicious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton is awesome , as always ! A better room was available and they kindly upgraded us without even having to ask . Staff was wonderful . Everything was im ##ma ##culate . Excellent location . Kim ##pton all the way ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I took a quick weekend trip to Chicago . The hotel had beautiful decorations for Christmas in the lobby ! There were also family activities as well . We had a suite that was very spacious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Except ##ional as always especially for a historic hotel . Co ##m ##fort ##able , updated rooms and friendly / helpful staff . Location is perfect in the middle of the magnificent mile . T ##ip - Upper floors are quiet ##er due to the street noise but . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Besides having an excellent location , this property is im ##ma ##culate ##ly clean and well designed ; the rooms have incredible views ; the staff is helpful and friendly . What more could you ask for . This is my favorite hotel in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love this place . The building and de ##cor are just our style , the P ##ump Room is a superb restaurant where we had another f ##abulous meal , and the staff as a whole are knowledge ##able and friendly . Thanks ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here while the Cubs were in the World Series and could not have picked a better location Downtown . The O ##m ##ni has a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting rooms with contemporary design features such as automatic shades / black ##out blind ##s . The service was superb ( meeting every O ##m ##ni brand expectation ) , the room had great views and was surprisingly quiet and co ##zy . I would highly recommend this O ##m ##ni location when selecting a place to stay in the heart of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location and is a very historic hotel . The hotel itself is well maintained and the common areas are very spacious and well maintained . We had a suite on the 20th floor which was huge . I was happy with the hotel and would come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location with rooms overlooking the Chicago River . It ' s been updated since our last visit . The rooms have a q ##ui ##rky charm and wide window ledge ##s with a comfortable pad and pillows for those a ##gi ##le enough to get up on one . The de ##cor is hard to pin down - maybe me ##dit ##er ##rane ##an meets modern - but it has q ##ui ##rky touches that fill the room with charm and make you smile . It ' s also dog friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They ad ##vert ##ise they have a swimming pool but they D ##O NO ##T H ##AV ##E A P ##O ##OL . Very disappointed - the pool was the reason we chose this hotel over others . Fe ##lt cheated over this in particular . Then there ' s the pu ##ddle in the wash ##room . Ah ##hh ##hh . . . The shower door leak ##s onto the bathroom - floor - a lot . Like a huge pu ##ddle . Can ' t be contained , even with all the towels . They came and tried to fix it but could not . If you take a shower be ready to have a huge pu ##ddle in your bathroom the rest of the time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Big Hilton near park and other attractions . Service was excellent . Staff was well - trained . Good job . The hotel is very big . It ’ s hard to get coffee at little store in the morning . The lines were long . G ##ym is amazing . Love ##d the gym . It ’ s huge . I was on a suite on 5th floor . It was very nice . But I ’ d go higher if I could to avoid traffic noise . Overall good stay . Hilton staff is better than most . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited Chicago for 5 nights and are so glad that we chose this hotel to stay in . The staff were friendly and helpful from check in right through to check out . The hotel is well situated with easy access to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Navy Pier and lots of other points of interest to us , has a lot of facilities including a gym , pool , AT ##M , Star ##bu ##cks and several restaurants with access to the river walk too . Our room was a good size with a view out onto the city . I would definitely recommend this hotel as a place to stay while in Chicago and feel the staff are a very strong plus point here too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great stay at this hotel . My room was clean and had a nice view of Lake Michigan . The staff was friendly and helpful . Noel , v ##alet staff , is amazing ! I cannot say enough about his customer service . He took the time , away from the v ##alet station , to assist me in finding the parking garage associated with the hotel . I look forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was fantastic , staff , service & food excellent . The location was close to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping , sights ##ee ##ing and multiple dining venues . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a place to return to for future visits . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Depending on your floor and section of the building , the view can be spectacular to looking directly into parked cars in a parking garage . The hotel itself is fine - the two elevators need to be about 8 - but the main problem is their network . I travel for business and rely on network - something Hilton is generally pretty good at proving . I signed up for their " " premium " " network as I am a Diamond member and this is included . The network speeds were 800 k ##b / s download , 150 k ##b / s up ##load . In 2016 , this is just completely unacceptable . I have read prior reviews from years ago on here pointing out these terrible network speeds and promises of upgrades but that apparently never happened . Bottom line - if you depends on network , stay elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent accommodation ##s in downtown Chicago . Near Michigan Ave , Mill ##eni ##um Park , theater district . $ 72 for hotel parking was very expensive . No coffee pot in room which would have been nice at this price point . Room comfortable and very attraction . Bath ##room with separate tub , shower and toilet room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were at the Hilton Chicago during the " polar v ##ortex " . Lucky for us , our event was there as well so we were able to stay in the entire time and enjoy our rooms and eat at the restaurants on location . Beautiful , historic hotel . Amazing customer service from all of the staff ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a room on the Executive levels of the hotel with a commanding view of Lake Michigan . This is a beautifully restored property and I highly re ##com ##med it for anyone visiting Chicago . The staff is extremely a ##cco ##mo ##dating . You will love it ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Visiting family , we stayed at the H ##ya ##tt Regency . This hotel is near the Chicago river walk . . . . there are lots of restaurants and things to do . The hotel was clean , affordable and decorated nicely for Christmas . The staff was friendly and our room was very nicely laid out . If you are spending some time in Chicago , definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay overall was pleasant : the room was clean and well furnished . However , the customer service wasn ' t great . We arrived to the hotel at 2 : 50 , but the front desk was ad ##aman ##t they would not see us until 3 : 00 sharp . Unfortunately , at 3 : 00 their entire booking system went off ##line , so we were delayed again . Furthermore , the staff didn ' t seem en ##thus ##ed to be working at the hotel . There were no " hello ##s " or greeting ##s - just g ##lum looks . As I said before , the room was clean and nice and in a good location , so if you can get a good rate on a room I say go for it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time visit to the So ##fit ##el Chicago , room was as pictured on the website . All staff were pleasant and check - in and check - out was simple . Noise from air conditioning and neighbours was minimal . Only thing that I would prefer is a larger bath ##tub , the one installed is not a soaking tub and being tall I have to chose either legs or torso under the water you can ##t have both . The hotel it ##ese ##lf is ideal ##ly located near many bus routes and eating places ; and is central to many landmarks , museums and points of interests . Most importantly ; would I stay here again a re ##sound ##ing Y ##ES [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , excellent service . A perfect choice for a family trip . Walking distance for Mill ##eni ##um Park as well as for the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The un ##mis ##sable Art Museum of Chicago is also not far from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is Ok but they are not customer focused . The staff are push ##y and have no flexibility . Don ' t trust the client and don ' t deliver to the promise on the services agreed . I am not satisfied of my stay at this property and don ' t recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location on the northern end of Michigan Ave at Walton . King room is very small and no bath ##tub , small window overlooking Walton . Hotel was built in the 1920 ' s thus the small room , limited elevators and elevators that hold a ma ##x of 6 people . Large furniture in a small room just doesn ' t work . Would stay elsewhere next time . Professional staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 6 ni ##tes at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in a double bed room . The room was spacious , well decorated , with all commodities ( fridge , coffee machine , snack ##s . . . ) . Good quality of the beds . The view was also correct ( south oriented ) . The negative point is the breakfast : no room dedicated for it : you have your breakfast in your bedroom . The breakfast is displayed on each floor in front of the lift . At 8 : 30 , there is little chance to get a fresh m ##uff ##in , no re ##ple ##nish ##ment . . . ! You have to get up earlier ; ) Too bad ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a beautiful stay at this hotel . The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff were helpful and kind . Had drinks in the Ta ##p ##room that was amazing and the con ##cier ##ge service was the best . High ##ly recommend this hotel if you are staying in downtown Chicago area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The main reception and meeting area is very grand and em ##ana ##tes old school op ##ule ##nce and 1930 ’ s Art Dec ##o feel - do not choose to stay here if you are looking for something more modern . Room ##s and corridors are a bit g ##loom ##y and tired . Of the three rooms our party of six had , not one had anything that would resemble a view - I did ask for one but wasn ’ t prepared to pay the excessive premium . Room itself was large but di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ate as bathroom was T ##IN ##Y - and I mean T ##IN ##Y ! Staff all very polite and friendly . Dec ##ent W ##IF ##I in rooms but then nothing in reception area ? ? [SEP]

Staff was helpful , baggage service was excellent , room service was great , and so was v ##alle ##t service . Close to everything . We will go back again ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suite we ended up in was very small and uncomfortable - we chose a suite because we had plans for a week . The furnishings were uncomfortable for average career people and cramped in the tiny suite ; barely room to walk around the bed . Everything was reasonably clean , but old and uncomfortable , and cramped . Average or less for $ 1700 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , clean , nice rooms and great staff . Everyone there was really nice and we ' re happy to help with anything . The beds were com ##fy , the room wasn ' t huge but wasn ' t too small either . Will definitely stay again . So much to see and do within walking distance . Night ##life is right at your fingertips if you want to get out at night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was lucky to pick to stay in Chicago k ##im ##pton Monaco I got upgraded to a suite that was Co ##m ##fort ##able and inviting . The view was spectacular .

1	[CLS] We picked this hotel to stay in the I ##H ##G chain , it location to Chicago downtown neighborhoods and the red ##line . the Red ##line was a short walk and easy trip to W ##rig ##ley Field . The room was a little small but the bed ##ding was so ##oo comfortable . Be careful of the mini ##bar it is on sensors . very nice seating area above the main lobby [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room I was assigned had paint fl ##aking off and mold in the bathroom . Second time this has happened at a Hilton hotel . Staff acted like they didn ' t know anything about it . How can you run a hotel and not know that your room has mold and the paint is fl ##aking off ? Key cards would stop working after several hours . Some staff were helpful others were not . Room ##s were incredibly small . I could hear people ' s conversations in the room next to me and hallway . Overall , terrible ex ##p . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Right in the middle of downtown activities . We rode the Hop - on Hop - off bus from the hotel to all the attractions on the Loop . The hotel restaurant had a wonderful breakfast bar where we ate every morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great views , great staff when you enter hotel . Room was never cleaned . Lo ##bby on 20th floor . Nice touch with N ##es ##press ##o . Like ##d the big shower but the shower head could have a better spread . TV blocks views . Nice corner room just a bit small for a 4 . 5 Star Hotel . Ice cooler was nice to keep drinks . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I absolutely ad ##ored my stay at the So ##fit ##el in Chicago . This was my first visit to the city , and will be returning . Hotel itself is well kept , clean , ch ##ic , just all around beautiful . The front desk staff were great always had a smile on their faces . The bell ##man were also really friendly , and court ##eous . In the morning I choose to eat at the hotel breakfast which I found to be delicious ! The staff there were great , friendly , and professional . The only negative post was the short amount I stayed in the beautiful city ! Next time I came back So ##fit ##el will be the hotel I stay in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Last minute booking and the agent was very friendly and agreed in accepting the deal we found online . Great location close to many restaurants , shops , and the magnificent mile .

1	[CLS] The hotel is a typically nice She ##rato ##n hotel - beautiful hotel , im ##ma ##culate rooms , comfortable beds , restaurants ( over ##p ##rice ##d of course ) great view of the river , location is great , just all good . . . . except the W ##i ##F ##i . Couldn ’ t hardly do any work while I was here for a conference . They have 2 W ##i ##F ##i networks - I couldn ’ t connect to our VP ##N using their regular W ##i ##F ##i - called She ##rato ##n front desk and they put me through to IT and they told me I had to use their other W ##i ##F ##i network that is just for people trying to sign on to a VP ##N . After 3 hours I finally got to work some , but even then I could not always connect to my VP ##N . Other than that the hotel is really nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a family trip to see Cubs win ( they delivered ! ) The experience was good from pulling up to the front to pulling away when we left . We use the v ##alet service which was well worth the money and so easy . Great location on north end of mile and staff was very friendly and helpful . Room ##s were clean and rain shower was nice . This hotel has an elegant fl ##air yet affordable for family like our just looking for a nice place to sleep while enjoying all that Chicago has to offer . [SEP]

1	[CLS] I stayed at Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel with my wife and 2 teens for 5 nights in early March . Check in was a breeze . The Ki ##nz ##ie staff was friendly , welcoming and helpful throughout our stay . Our room was clean and spacious . The location is prime , within walking distance to the Ma ##g Mile to the north , and numerous great restaurants and other sites and attractions in all directions . The continental breakfast included several great options each morning . The manager ’ s reception each evening was fantastic , with p ##lent ##iful , ta ##sty small plate options . The Ki ##nz ##ie definitely exceeded our expectations in all respects . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Well located hotel with easy access to various sights and , in my case , very close to the Chicago Marathon activities and good place for walking , cycling and j ##og ##ging . Great shops and restaurants nearby [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice to have everything in one place : wedding , app ##eti ##zers , meal , dessert , dancing and after party . The food served at the wedding was excellent , and everything was convenient . It was an evening to remember at the O ##m ##ni . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location in the middle of Michigan Avenue / Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . We were in the old classic tower . Need ##ed to take a second special elevator to get to room .

1	[CLS] We were blown away by the service ! Honestly , we were treated like queen ##s and kings ! We loved out suite and chocolate straw ##berries ! It was so nice being walking distance away from everything ( : We will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over ##night get ##away , we arrived early about 10 : 30 and thought we would have to leave our bags before check in but we were able to get in our room right away ( coincide ##ntal ##ly when leaving the next am , they also check another couple in early ) which I was very pleased about . Our anniversary , we mentioned having an overnight in the city upon check in which they took the liberty to send us wine and a lovely g ##ana ##che dessert a few hours later ( surprise ) . The suite that we had was great ( clean and modern ) with most anything I would expect in a room . There was a TV in the bedroom and the sitting area ( not that we needed 2 but would be nice for others ) . All in all a very nice stay and we would stay again when we return for another weekend . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Clean and contemporary . . . the quality of the a ##cco ##mo ##dation was very good ##G ##ood location to enjoy the city and near Downtown and the Mill ##ene ##um Park . The service was good and staff were very attention ##ed to our demand . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love to stay at the Intercontinental Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile when we visit Chicago at Christmas . The staff is professional , court ##eous , and extremely helpful , the location is great , and the rooms are very nice as well . The down ##side is the elevator can be very slow - like 5 minute wait and the cost of parking overnight - the only option is v ##alet so unless you research and find another place to park ( overnight ) on your own , you ' re stuck with it . But it ' s in the heart of the city so what do you expect , right ? Great value , great hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Un ##friend ##ly front desk staff . No sense that this was a high - end hotel . Pool was out of service and no one told us . We showed up in swim ##sui ##ts to find a sign on the door in the locker room . Staff did not respond to requests for assistance . Room was next to the elevator band , was dark and felt dated . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A beautiful luxury property with all amenities and great eat ##eries on - site . A court ##eous hotel staff makes for a wonderful stay . A heat ##hy breakfast is offered for a reasonable cost in the restaurant , which turns into a great venue for dinner and drinks in the evening . The location is prime for lovers of all attractions .

It was great for a night , very happy with our selection . The rate was reasonable for the accommodation and service provided . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent a wonderful weekend in Chicago at the Conrad ; what a perfect location and beautiful hotel . Our room was spacious , comfortable , and spot ##less . The restaurant Baptiste & Bo ##ttle ##s was great for breakfast and for cocktail ##s . Most of all , the staff was nothing but welcoming , g ##rac ##ious , and helpful . Upon realizing I had left an important item behind after leaving ( and flying all the way home ) , I called the hotel and was helped immediately by the amazing house ##keeping leaders , Gloria and Hunter , who went out of their way to recover the item and return it to me safely . I am so grateful for their help - they went above and beyond ! I will definitely be returning to the Conrad ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary with a spur of the moment get ##away . If we had planned this for months , we could not have scored more breath ##taking v ##ista ##s . Thanks to Joshua at the front desk , who put us in room 280 ##4 with windows on all sides — and spectacular views of Lake Michigan , the Chicago River in the city Sky ##line . Other per ##ks included compliment ##ary smooth ##ies and a shoe shine . Can ’ t wait to return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Extreme ##ly disappointed , picked up a couple beers to put in the fridge , only to find out no refrigerator available unless you want to pay the incredible prices for the mini ##bar . I wouldn ’ t stay here again , no refrigerator options . Very disappointed , other hotels provide refrigerator ##s . No thanks to this place , avoid it all costs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are looking for a hotel that is quiet but quite accessible to the g ##ems of downtown Chicago , then this should be one of your options . What I really like about this hotel is their big twin bed rooms . If you are a family of four , then you should consider this hotel . There is also a separate shower and toilet ( plus a bath tub ) . Although , some twin bedrooms have a long sofa but the other twin bedrooms only have a single sofa . By the way , if you are just staying inside your room the whole day , make sure you don ##t forget to put the Don ' t Di ##st ##ur ##b sign outside of your room or the house keeper will keep on knocking your door for house keeping . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el Chicago is une ##x ##cell ##ed in Chicago per their ability to satisfy all of then needs of the traveling public . I have stayed their since they opened , and each visit gets better . Be sure to check the newly refurbished bar . . . . . . . outstanding ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Each staff member treated us all with respect and kindness . The follow up texts to make sure all was well was most welcome ! Very grateful for this staff . The hotel itself is GO ##R ##GE ##O ##US ! ! ! I cannot wait for our conference here again next year . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago was perfect for our conference . Between the many amenities and meeting rooms it exceeded all of our needs . On top of that the food was amazing and the bar was fun . I would definitely recommend staying here for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Fair ##mont for a recent bi ##z trip . Pro . Location . Con ##ven ##ient to Miracle Mile , Mill ##eni ##um Park , museums , theatre , and restaurants . Staff was friendly . Meeting services were good . Con ##s . Room ##s need updated . The furniture was worn and torn . Did not seem up to the standard of the Fair ##mont . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The standard king room was too small to accommodate two people comfortably . The bathroom was small and cramped and the sink counter space could not fit two individual sets of toilet ##ries . There was only a desk chair in the room so two people could not sit together and enjoy a bottle of wine and a snack . Very unacceptable . The de ##cor was dark and not very plea ##sing to the eye . Re ##ception desk is next to exposed bar that gets very loud when the bar is open . Very hard to talk and hear reception well at these times . It is convenient ##ly located in the theatre district . Stay and v ##alet package is a good buy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location . Din ##ing room staff were so friendly and helpful - made meal ##time ##s a pleasure . Social evenings te ##rri ##fic . Perfect ##ly clean . Lost one star because the w ##if ##i in the rooms hardly ever worked . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is top in my books from the people to the room it is top notch . You are made to feel welcome from the minute you step out of the car and begin your experience . You are made to feel very welcome just like you are at home . the service team is always working making sure that your room is as you like it and you have what you need . Great place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was traveling to Chicago for a business interview when , in a near collision with a moving truck , one of my tires blew out . After limp ##ing my car to the Swiss ##ote ##l , I was met with the most court ##eous staff im ##agi ##na ##ble . Special shout - out to Al ##en for his effort in helping me put on the spare , filling it up with air , and recommend ##ing the best options to find a replacement tire ( @ Swiss ##ote ##l , give that man a bonus ! ) Beyond the little incident , Swiss ##ote ##l has absolutely beautiful views from their rooms , amazing amenities , and very com ##fy room features . I will definitely be thank ##ing my potential employer for choosing this location ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] When we arrived at the Fair ##mont hotel , we were informed that there was no room available , even though we had made the reservation three months earlier and pre ##pa ##id . They sent us to another hotel , which did not offer net ##her the same kind of breakfast nor the beverages and app ##eti ##zer that we included in our reservation . The following morning , we had to go back to the Fair ##mont hotel early in the morning , because we had a scheduled tour , but we could not check - in until later . All of this was a mayor in ##con ##ven ##ience , specially because we looking forward to enjoy our vacation in Chicago . The service provided the staff members Man ##dan ##a and Jesus was exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s and bathroom ##s are quite nice . Very clean ! Staff were pleasant . Small issue in gym . 3 of the t ##read ##mill ##s belts were skip ##ping when I tried them out . . . I notified the front desk and assume something was done about it . Other than that , I think this hotel is good value for money ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary with a weekend in Chicago . The Conrad was a wonderful starting point for our activities . It is right by all the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping , and all the Chicago restaurants , shows , etc . Staff was , to a person , very friendly , helpful and positive . Room ##s were spacious and comfortable . All in all , it was a wonderful weekend , and the Conrad was a big part of it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel close to everything , right by Michigan Ave , Chicago River and Lake Michigan . See ##med to focus on the conference and work travelers with tons of ballroom ##s and conference rooms but didn ' t bother us as tourists . Love ##d having Amazon ##G ##o close by , . Room ##s were clean , and good size . Love ##d text ##ing for check out . [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able Evening in nice King Bed . No premium cable channels . Room was clean & adequate ( a bit worn & dated ) in size for 2 people . Only 1 bath robe in room though - what ' s up with that ? Unless both people are supposed to jointly wear together . Very nice staff and very quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall service was wonderful . Upon realizing that our room didn ’ t have a mini fridge we were brought a mini fridge by an employee who was very nice . The bed was worn out and didn ’ t allow for a great night rest . In addition the water pressure left room for improvement . [SEP]
0	[CLS] While the view from our room was not awesome , our room was spacious , very clean and also very well ins ##ulated . Moreover , the staff was always friendly and give us some very good advice . De ##fin ##ite ##ly , I recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed only one night but the room was very nice , clean and comfortable . The hotel is also close to shopping on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Check ##ing in and out was easy and fast . I appreciated the v ##alet parking so I didn ' t have to try to figure out where to park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff made the difference . All welcoming and helpful . This is a great hotel in the perfect spot North of downtown to be close enough to the nice shops and restaurants around the corner ( like Tavern on the Rush and Frog ##s ) but easily walk ##able to both the Zoo and the main downtown area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the hotel . We went right before ch ##rist ##mas 2019 and the hotel was beautiful . It was interesting to explore the hotel and the decorations . The hotel is very large and interesting to see . It was far enough to not be in the crowded downtown but still close enough to walk everywhere we wanted to go . Room was excellent , much larger than we expected and plenty space for all ch ##rist ##mas shopping and to relax . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were very close to the ma ##g mile and Navy Pier . We could walk to everything . The bed was super com ##fy and the room was very clean . I would definitely stay again . It was a bit of a b ##um ##mer that W ##i ##F ##i wasn ’ t free , other than that it was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So ##fit ##el is our home away from home when we travel . We stay in Chicago So ##fit ##el especially when in town . Auto upgrade to premier suite for being a loyal patron is nice . The premier suite is amazing . Her ##mes products in bathroom are good . Good room sizes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie several times and have had a good experience . This time the room I had booked was not available and I was given a different room . The shower was awful . Bar ##ely a stream of water . Then when I tried to even use that it came out cold . I called the front desk But nothing could be done because I needed to leave and head to a business meeting . Poor experience - avoid this room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room amenities are great . Lots of desk space . A million power outlets in convenient places . Very friendly and helpful staff . Quiet . Evening Re ##ception is nice . Breakfast meets needs for a hotel breakfast . Order ##ed room service from Harry Cara ##y ( only option ) and I really don ' t recommend it . In ##tens ##ely salt ##y fish . Limited menu , not their entire menu . Wanted simple fish but it was drowning in liquid and season ##ing . Lots of convenient places nearby though so you can and should simply go out . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Common areas are amazing . When found , staff is re ##sp ##ons ##ive , polite , and . Line ##ns and towels felt lightly used . Room ##s are just worn down . Lam ##p shades and room carpet ##s were gross and should be replaced . G ##rab and go good service was nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service . Great location . The room was clean and the view was great . They had a wine hour every night from 5 to 6 which was awesome . Would recommend this place highly . It ' s location was perfect to walking to all the places that a person would want to go on a visit to Chicago . The magnificent mile , millennium Park , the Navy pier and great restaurants were all within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I chose this hotel looking at the reviews . While the location is excellent , the rooms are par . They do not offer any luxury one would associate with Conrad . Business facilities are below average with no work desk or convenient outlets . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , located on S . Michigan Ave - so many things nearby . Check in was quick and has ##sle free - room was not c ##laus ##tro ##phic . Very safe , very clean . Food - overall very good Had coffee and snack ##s at the little take out shop prior to heading to M ##c ##C ##our ##mic ##k and took out food from Irish Pub Kitty O ' Shea ' s ( located in lobby ) that was excellent . Order ##ed room service one night - was quick and efficient and the deep dish pizza I ordered was not Lou Mal ##nat ##i ' s or G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s . . . but it was pretty ta ##sty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a completely other expectation before my arrival in the hotel . Based on pricing and the photos on their home ##page I thought this will be a really good hotel in a historic building . But it is just old . Hall ##ways are smell ##y , carpet ##s old , Internet costs extra ( this is really ridiculous in those modern times ! ) . Matt ##resses are very soft , but of course there are people who will like this fact - I had back ##ache after just one night . Only positive thing was the good size of the room . . . Service also ma ##x . mid - class . We asked for body lot ##ion because there was none in the bathroom and heard " we bring it to your room in few minutes " - they never came . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tor requires additional fee , and I had to request an ice bucket . Excellent coffee and tea in room , no real cream ##er . Very good house ##keeping , with several offerings of free offerings like comb ##s , tooth brushes and razor ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed here for a business trip and was very pleased . The front desk was friendly and we were able to get in our room an 10 : 00 ##am which we greatly appreciated . The room was very nice and the recent renovations and upgrades were a nice touch . The pool area was spot ##less and well maintained . Great location and clean hotel and friendly staff would highly recommend to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . The architecture in the lobby is beautiful . Not much of a view from my room , tall buildings close by . Very clean . Would have preferred a restaurant in house for dinner as opposed to ordering at the bar , but the option to get it as a carry out was available . Close to 7 mile shopping made it all worth it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a family reunion in Chicago and wanted to re - connect to D ##T / Michigan Avenue so chose the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . On the + 10 - the location is perfect . On the + 5 - everyone is as my hub ##by says : " cool and efficient ! " On the - 0 - a cup of morning coffee is $ 3 . 00 + , the newspaper is not compliment ##ary ( if you can get one ) , the elevator is old and very slow . For me the most e ##g ##re ##gio ##us was when you call for information , the tone is almost dem ##ean ##ing ! I asked if I could warm something up ( special meal ) and was told ( coldly ) : " No mad ##am , you can not ! " My sense it that since Michigan Avenue hotels are so heavily booked , there is not need to treat guests well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here during Lo ##lla ##pal ##oz ##za and the crowds were crazy but the Hilton staff did a great job of taking care of everything . We had a room with two queen beds and the best part was that it had two bathroom ##s . What an awesome feature . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel about 50 days out and thought I got an excellent rate . Park ##ing on site is expensive but all hotels in area are . Prime location , view of river , basically one block off Mi ##cha ##gan Ave , 3 blocks from the bean and park . Room was very nice size with nice bathroom amenities . Bar at hotel had very good selection of premium drinks . Did not eat at hotel . But overall great place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the third time that I stayed in this hotel . The food and beverage service of the hotel worse ##ned dramatically compared to previous years and you are not at all getting 5 star hotel service . Despite of many calls we could not reach anybody for ordering room service . Every morning we had to wait 20 minutes for getting into breakfast room and another 30 minutes for just getting bag ##els ! ! ! We wanted to talk to food and beverage manager and the answer was he or she was very busy ? ? ? No proper answer or call back to our complaint letter . They just send a phone number and asked to call them after 1 day we check out from the hotel . To sum up the hotel is not any more the Hilton Conrad it used to be and I would not recommend to anybody expecting 5 star hotel service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My ##self and my husband essentially lived in The Ambassador in the lead up to our destination Chicago wedding - - therefore I believe our lengthy stay warrant ##s a very much deserved review . The aesthetic of the hotel is breath ##taking , the am ##bie ##nce in each public space feels fitting , the guest rooms are modern , comfortable , clean and calming . Is ##hm ##ael , Kay , Natalie , among all others on staff , are spectacular - - they went above and beyond helping us and most of our wedding guests with endless luggage , questions , issues . The hotel manager kindly sent us a bottle of b ##ub ##bly and straw ##berries upon our arrival , and when our guests began to arrive , Is ##hame ##l and the others had more b ##ub ##bly and good ##ies sent to our room . We have and will happily return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed our stay and the location of this hotel . It ' s an easy walk to Michigan Avenue and all the shopping as well as walking distance to Navy P ##ei ##r . En ##oy ##ed our view from the room overlooking the river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had meetings at the G ##lea ##cher Center . Super convenient . The hotel is great for meetings in downtown Chicago in the loop . It is a large convention type hotel . If you ' re looking for service and style - I am sure there are other alternatives . For convenience and simple business hotel - it works . , [SEP]

0	[CLS] The Free ##hand Hotel at 19 E Ohio St , Chicago , IL 60 ##6 ##11 registered me for a room via a third party called hotels . com on Feb 11 , 2020 , they requested I enter my z ##ip code , telephone number , address and credit card . When I arrived they would not provide me with the room I paid for and refused to return my money . At the time of payment the my area code ; address ; z ##ip code had been verified prior to y payment being taken from my credit card . The clerk had full knowledge that I was a Chicago resident when I paid and she claimed I could not stay in the hotel room because I was a Chicago resident and refused to re ##fu ##nd the money . Two police officers arrived and made me leave and kept my hotel room and my credit card payment was kept by the hotel . I slept outside , as a result . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My Talbot ##t Family - same staff over a decade of service to my family . In ##ti ##mate warm space . Restaurant GM very welcoming after a long day of sight seeing and shopping . En ##joy ##ed compliment ##ary glass of wine . . . and nice time on P ##elo ##ton bike in the morning in the newer work ##out space . Will try to go back before end of year - thank you Talbot ##t ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] No upgrades . No breakfast . They give you $ 15 per day claiming you can spend on food . $ 15 for breakfast in Chicago ? Seriously ? Room safe not working after check in . Re ##quest for change of room . C ##lai ##m to have no room . Stay away ! Not the same Conrad experience you are expecting elsewhere ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago is the way to enjoy Chicago at its heart . Great location which can offer stunning views both daytime and night ##time . Many of the amenities ( restaurants , lo ##bb ##ies , front door services , etc . were closed because of CO ##VI ##D during our stay - - as it should be ) . We felt comfortable and well taken care of for anything we needed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I usually stay at Kim ##pton hotels for business but this time ##less a birthday get away for my 13 year old . When we checked in I quietly asked for any free upgrade they could give us for her . We then went off to explore . When we returned to check in they had upgraded us to a corner suite on the 12th floor ! Need ##less to say my 13 was thrilled - as was I ! They also left a birthday card & pop ##corn . They views were spectacular and she hardly left the windows seat overlooking the river . It made her weekend . Thanks for your kindness . We will be back soon . [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Julius Do ##xy , at hotel guest check - in was wonderful . He provided excellent customer service with his enthusiastic reviews of restaurants and night life . Going that extra mile in kindness and thoughtful ##ness ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a wonderful hotel that adds their creative personal touches for a unique experience during your stay . We were greeted with friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff as well as our very own gold ##fish to enjoy during our visit . Our room had a great view of the river , Chicago sky ##scraper ##s , and two window seats to comfortably relax while ad ##miring the scenery . We also appreciated the convenient location to many restaurants , the Chicago Bean , and theater district . We will be staying here again on our next visit to the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Fair ##mont for 2 nights while on business . I stayed in a king bed suite . It included a spectacular view , couch , t ##v , large closet , van ##ity and a large bathroom with a tub and separate shower . The hotel was also close to many tourist attractions . I highly recommend this hotel whether traveling for business or personal reasons . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean , quiet , relaxing hotel with rooms for any budget . From the standard rooms up to the suites , you will not be disappointed . Walking distance to Michigan Ave and Mill ##eni ##um Park . The club level is spectacular with compliment ##ary snack ##s , pop , water , etc . Also has big screen TV ' s , computer and work stations on the second level . Inc ##red ##ible views ! Erica at the front desk was extremely helpful with our room selection and was always wearing a smile . De ##fin ##ite ##ly keep an eye out for her . Loves to help others and it shows ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Spa ##cious room , kind staff , and close to everything we wanted to see . We had a noisy family on our hallway , but the staff s ##hus ##hed them quickly . Smart pan ##de ##mic policies , and good value . We ' d stay there again without hesitation . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I took my teenage boys to Chicago for the first time . Not knowing anything about the city , everyone at the hotel was so helpful . Mostly Chuck the door ##man ! He suggested several ideas and places for us which saved us a lot of money . It was a short trip so I am planning another time to visit . I will stay at the hotel always and suggest it to anyone going to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really spacious rooms and bathroom ##s . Great views . Good food . Easy access to the Spa . Help ##ful staff . Good location . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds . Nice size t . v . V ##ari ##ed selection in mini ##bar . Wish I could have stayed longer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This rating is for similar properties . Do NO ##T bring your family . This is a hotel for business singles and weekend parties . They were very re ##sp ##ons ##ive to in ##quiries and requests , but I think to combat this s ##ti ##gma . I was in town for the A ##HA meeting and brought my family . I had to call the front desk each night to send security up after drunk people came in after midnight , yelling and screaming on our floor and woke up the kid . As most parents might em ##path ##ize ; once the sleep is broken . . . end times . . . . this trip ended up being 3 sleep ##less nights in a hotel that was renowned for comfort . Very disappointed . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just awful disappointment . I was there for conference . No service when booked to near 100 % capacity , only ONE reception ##ist at 7 ##AM during busy check out . Un ##believable . Te ##rrible communication of staff , some rude . Opera ##tor was rude . The bill had incorrect mistaken room rate charges . And the $ 40 " upgrade " to executive lounge was a joke with very poor quality cheap fatty high car ##b breakfast and PM app ##eti ##zers and only ONE staff member for entire hotel lounge . I will not be recommend ##ing this site for future meetings . Too bad . Good location . But fortunate ##ly , there are other good looking competitors nearby . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall the service and the hotel were very good . The only concerns that I have were the view looking out my window , so maybe location , and the bartender was not the most pro ##mpt as I have seen . It was busy , but noon ##e greeted me while I was with a group and the rest had been served . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were quite small but that was not a big deal for us since we were out and about sight seeing the entire weekend . The rooms were nicely decorated and very clean . The bathroom ##s were quite modern and lovely . The bed and pillows were very comfortable . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and happily assisted us with a few special requests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel right in the center of the town . About a 5 - 10 walk to the lake , it ' s a straight shot from the hotel down Randolph St . It ' s decorated so that you feel like you ' re in the 1920 ' s . The staff is very friendly & knowledge ##able . My only complaints were that the rooms were smaller than expected & really no place to put your suitcase . The closet was narrow & only 2 small drawers next to the mini bar . I was there for a week & had to really just live out of my suitcase on the floor . Be aware that there is no room service but you can grab " Food to Go " at the bar . Which means pre - made sandwiches & salad ##s . Also , from 5 - 6 they offer compliment ##ary happy hour serving Pro ##se ##cco ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you like hotels with a sense of place and history , you ' ll love the Palmer . It reminds me very much of the W ##aldo ##rf As ##toria in NYC ( which has been closed for a few years now for renovations ) . Gorge ##ous lobby with great cocktail ##s and people watching . I ' ve stayed here a few times and the location can ' t be beat . A nice s ##tro ##ll down the water to museums , fantastic shopping and theater , and a quick cab to anything else . Room ##s can be small and bathroom ##s cramped , but well worth it for the location and rich history . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was excellent from the workers to the way the bed feels to the shades on the windows . I would only say the room I stayed in didn ' t have a tub and I didn ' t like that . Also there wasn ' t a lot of space to move around the bed area if they cut some of the closet space it would have been more room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I usually stay at the Burn ##ham , but because they have new ownership I thought I would try the Monaco . It was everything I expected . The staff was very friendly and the room had the same funk ##y v ##ibe as the Burn ##ham . The hotel is in a great location at the north end of the Loop . I did not get a chance to try the local restaurant options , but the wine in the lobby early in the evening was a pleasant treat . I was very happy with my stay . The room was quiet and it had all the Kim ##pton benefits . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Home ##wood Suite ##s Downtown Chicago is exactly what they say . . . in the heart of Chicago . We had easy access to everywhere we wanted to visit . Whether via train , bus , or foot access to what Chicago has to offer is virtually right near this hotel . We will book this hotel again whenever we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room I stayed at had a partial lake view which was nice . I was told that it was a recently re ##f ##resh ##ed room but it still seemed tired to me . The staff was helpful but the reception desk staff could have been more professional . They seemed all too casual in their behavior . The only choice on Sunday for dining was the bar and they had a very limited menu of only cold bites . It was very convenient ##ly located with many steak houses in walking distance but not a lot of diversity . The members lounge had limited amenities and services . Overall a nice hotel but nothing extraordinary . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , just steps away from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and State St . , Red line ##´s Chicago St . Station is just a couple of minutes away . All the staff is very professional , nice and welcoming . Our room was very comfortable , kept clean , with all the amenities ( and of good quality ! ) necessary for a great stay . W ##i - fi worked very well and was free of charge . A hotel that I would recommend to friends with no hesitation . And of course I would come back as well ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great value and great experience . Room was clean , bright , spacious , quiet and with excellent amenities including large screen TV and comfortable bathroom facilities . Hotel has an excellent location and the staff were professional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had the best corner room on the 4th floor ! So many windows and the view was really nice ! The best past was Spencer at con ##cier ##ge , he was very friendly and persona ##ble and gave us such positive experience I love how they offer a text message service for places to eat and places to go within walking distance which is helpful for people from out of town . Also Derrick at Vale ##t was very friendly and helpful . Thank you for such a great Custom ##er service and we have already told our friends to stay here next time ! We hope to be back soon ! - Kris ##tal & Tom H . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first H ##ya ##tt stay . I was at a conference here . The hotel is beautiful , huge , nice fitness center , restaurant on site . The cost per night was reasonable and the room was spacious and clean . I would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I got room in corner of third floor . Problems with internet , when called to tell them , I was told internet was working . have to bring computer to front desk , internet works there , finally listen to me when I told them to follow me to room and they were able to check I was not lying . Also having issues with t ##v remote control . they came and changed it , but still having issues , I have to stand 12 inches away to change channels . i stay three days and door ##men never open door for me . I thought this was a little off since there were always people at the door in need of help [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here overnight . S ##pent the extra on a river / lake view and it was well worth it . Modern room , class ##y de ##cor and plenty of space ! One of the larger flat screen TV ##s in a hotel . . . at least 55 in . Lo ##bby is spacious and modern . We didn ’ t eat on site but there were a couple options . The elevator system is smart . . . you have a dedicated elevator for your floor to eliminate stopping at every floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Usually my go - to as an SP ##G member for business . ( Now Bon ##voy ) . Fair value for a better She ##rato ##n . Would give this a 3 . 5 if that were available . Close to business appointments in the loop area . Great lounge . I always go there thinking they need more help or people ready to greet you at the front desk . Big problem and pretty consistent to wait . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great room . They had our room ready by 11 ##am . We expected to just drop our bag and come back at 4 . ( Normal check in time ) . Nice corner suite overlooking Michigan Ave and all of the Christmas lights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You are certainly paying for the location with this property , which is well - located to downtown and the typical tourist sights . Unfortunately , the hotel rooms are in need of an update - beds are hard and the de ##cor looks very old ( old carpet , tan wall ##paper , lack of USB ports ) . If you are not an SP ##G member , they also charge for W ##if ##i - even though it is 2018 and Super 8 has had free w ##if ##i for years . Staff members were very court ##eous and service was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was good . Nice beds and bathroom was ok . Close to Mill ##enia ##l park and the gold mile . Some down ##side to our trip : coming to the hotel at 16 : 30 and getting a choice : another room with 2 beds instead of a king or to wait approx another hour . After a day of travelling you just want to have the room ready . And parking is quite ex ##p ##ns ##ive , but that is the same story for all down town hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Emerson , a very sweet and helpful guy at the front desk , checked us in and we were delighted to find that we had been upgraded to an amazing room with awesome window seats and views of the river . This hotel is in a great location in downtown Chicago and the staff are the best . Stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has the perfect location with exceptional views . The staff were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and assisted with ever aspect of out trip . Bernard , the con ##cier ##ge , was outstanding . We experienced an unpleasant smell in our room and were upgraded immediately . The only disappointing factors were the lobby bar closed before midnight on a Saturday night and the lack of a work ##out facility . Overall great hotel and I would return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got a deal on Hot Wire and it was perfect for a quick trip into downtown . Was a 5 minute walk to the Maggie Dale ##y Skating Ribbon which was also awesome - free and no waiting if you take your own skate ##s . Swiss ##ote ##l had very com ##fy rooms with beautiful views . Be ##ware - GPS has a very hard time working correctly downtown , and Map ##s kept taking us to Lower W ##ack ##er d ##r . Be sure to manually type in 32 ##3 E Upper W ##ack ##er Dr . , NO ##T just E W ##ack ##er Dr . Vale ##t parking expensive but worth it as the garage isn ’ t right on site . Overall , would definitely stay here again knowing what we do now . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we walked into the Lo ##bby , the a ##roma & feeling of excellence was obvious . The Staff truly made us feel like " Guest ##s " . The Room was " World Class " . We can ' t wait to return & make new memories . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni in downtown Chicago is a great location - walking to downtown , theater , restaurants , and shopping right there on Michigan Ave . Deluxe suite - comfortable , clean , well - let , f ##abulous linen ##s , large bathroom with tub . Excellent service . Re ##lative ##ly quiet compared to other hotels in the area . This time their rate was the best so te ##rri ##fic value . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Ke ##enan greeted me with such a big smile and was egg ##er to help me figure out my travel plans . He connected me to another cow ##or ##ker , De ##met ##rie Jones , who took customer service above and beyond and provided a driving service to the airport the following morning . Both Ke ##enan and De ##met ##rie are such positive re ##fect ##ion ' s of the hotel and I wanted to make sure that their efforts and actions doesn ' t go unnoticed ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel , once well run , sophisticated and reserved , is over run and over ##mat ##ched . It has lost its former character and am ##bian ##ce . We will find a new place next time we are in town and that is disappointing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , able to walk to great restaurants , stores , etc . Front desk is always pleasant and helpful , first rate house keeping staff . The bar is great and the food is also . All around a great place for your Chicago stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] 9 members of my family celebrated the holidays in Chicago during the cold ##est period of time , the weekend before Christmas . We bundled up and walked the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile to shop , went to the Navy Pier for the Winter Wonder ##fest , spent some time at the Christ ##kind ##lma ##rk ##et , walked through the original Marshall Field ' s store ( now Macy ' s ) , and also went to Millennium Park to see " The Bean " . The She ##rato ##n Grand was perfectly situated in the center of all our planned activities . They provided a free shuttle service to Macy ' s in the Loop or the shops at Water Tower Place . If you need a ride from and back to the airport , talk to the Con ##cier ##ge . We were provided very reasonable , reliable and professional transportation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My partner and I used the Talbot ##t hotel for our room block for our wedding . The staff was great , our guests loved the location and the rooms are nice and modern . My only complaint was the fee they tried to charge for handing out the gift bags we provided for out of town guests . I do want to give a special shout out to the bell ##men . D ##wayne N ##ef ##f in particular is outstanding . He goes above and beyond . My in - laws stay here every time they come to Chicago . We always look forward to seeing D ##wayne . He really personal ##izes the experience . And his friendly presence is a comfort . [SEP]
0	[CLS] At first I was nervous about staying at the Conrad because I was not familiar with it . All fears disappeared when I entered the lobby and was greeted by the staff . The staff was wonderful and the room was elegant . It reminded me of art de ##co but with modern features ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Back again to the Ki ##nz ##ie and loving the con ##cier ##ge text ##ing ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly tried not to over do it this visit B ##UT they don ' t seem to mind the one on one service they are happily providing ! When you check in be sure to set yourself up for this quick and convenient communication method . Think " press 0 " for maid service , v ##alet , extra pillow . . . but from your phone while you are in a meeting or hitting the Ma ##g Mile for some afternoon shopping . Na ##iled it Ki ##nz ##ie . Thanks again to the front desk crew you guys rock ! Ken / Gabriel / Gerry ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very friendly and helpful on check in and departure . I was also pleasant ##ly surprised by the size of the room . The hotel ' s location is convenient as well being walking distance to shops are restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Worst hotel I have ever stayed at . The amenities are a lie . Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tor in the room is useless . They charge $ 25 for an in room refrigerator . Del ##iver ##ed to my room room with no shelves . What a joke . I complained , and they had a guy bring me one shelf , and it didn ' t fit the refrigerator properly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The place is nice and co ##zy . The staff are very friendly and welcoming . The hotel , hallway ##s , elevators and rooms are very clean and new . They have free coffee in the m ##orn ##ig and free wine hour from 5 to 6 ##pm which was a pleasant surprise . The location is a big plus with walking di ##sta ##b ##ce to almost everything you gotta see in ch ##ica ##go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed at this hotel for a business trip and it was a fantastic experience . Custom ##er service was exceptional , rooms spacious , extremely comfortable bed and great conference facilities . Excellent location for exploring downtown Chicago on foot too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent three nights in room with a king bed . The room was spacious and I thought the design was excellent . There were plenty of places to plug in , lots of flat surface space , mini - bar . The staff was very helpful although our needs were few . Bed was comfortable and loved the shower . House ##keeping was excellent and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . Location was handy to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile but great for all the shops on Oak St and the restaurants on Rush . Lou Mal ##nat ##i ' s is a 10 minute walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is great place to stay with the family . Room ##s are good size , and the kids both fit on the sofa bed . Everything is clean . The breakfast in the morning makes is super easy to start the day . There are tons of restaurants around and there is a refrigerator and microwave in the room to heat up left ##overs for when the kids need an extra snack between activities . And it ' s a 10 minute walk to the Miracle Mile . It ' s definitely a hotel that I ' d stay at again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lots of charm , but if you want your charge ##rs to work in your room or the a / c to work well , you might think again . Tri ##ed to check in 30 minutes early , and despite room being open , was told there would be a fee . . even for H Honors member . Had to change in men ’ s bathroom for my meeting . Great location and bar area , but needs a re ##f ##resh . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic hotel , very clean , staff very friendly , convenient location . The rooms are very updated . The staff at the main desk were very willing to give suggestions on places to go , close places to eat , etc . Very friendly and helpful Room ##s quiet and spacious [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent room , nice hotel within walking distance of practically everything . Friendly and helpful staff , happening bar scene . Could use a working fridge instead of one dedicated to mini - bar and purchase - only drinks . I had to chill my wine in the bathroom sink ! But would definitely re - book . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This property is gorgeous , staff is amazing and it is located right in the heart of everything . I had friends come over that live in Chicago and we were going to , lo ##uma ##ln ##ati ##s . I have never been to Chicago and your Bell ##man Chris was so helpful , great customer service , he welcomed me and even gave us a coup ##on . He truly was an ambassador of excellent customer service . He then saw me return and asked did I enjoy it , truly made me feel special . The rooms are spacious , super clean , and the bathroom was made with a woman in mind , from the make up mirrors to the lighting . W ##OW ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location ! 5 - 15 ##mins walk to the mill ##eni ##um park , water tower , John Hancock building , Chicago theaters , The Mart , Willis Tower and many more . Room ##s are clean at reasonable price . Staff are friendly . They can store your luggage if needed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time to Chicago - Great Hotel - Safe , Central , Staff Great , Friendly and Really Help ##ful . Little disappointing on the breakfast front . . . Other than that - Great Con ##cier ##ge and Front Line Staff . Would Stay there again for sure ! Room ##s beautifully appointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Fair ##mont is in such a great location it ’ s a short walk to a lot of the places you must see when you visit this great city ! The hotel is truly a 5 Star property clean , beautiful and everyone here couldn ’ t be nice ##r or more helpful in making our first time in Chicago the best . I highly recommend the Fair ##mont if you are planning a trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First of all , this review is not about the hotel per se . The hotel itself is fine . Con ##sist ##ent with other reviews , the hotel is old but pleasant enough . I am very disappointed by the sur ##cha ##rge of " facility fees " . I booked my stay through hotels . com , where the " facility fees " are listed as ' optional extra ##s " along with v ##alet parking , breakfast , etc . Upon check - in , the front - desk told me that everything has been paid for . However , the facility fees did appear on my credit card statement . I called the hotel , which told me that the facility fees are mandatory . Hotels . com refused to acknowledge any misleading information . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My son left a medical device in a bathroom after staying at the Hilton with his grandparents . I was having trouble getting it returned to me in a time ##ly manner and was worried and frustrated . De ##bra M ##c ##N ##ary in the security lost and found area went above and beyond to help me get the device back . Thank you , De ##bra ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was large , good view and well appointed . Very quiet . Bath ##room was large , made even better by a separate shower and tub . Well stock ##ed with toilet ##ries and towels . The staff is very careful not to in ##tr ##ude . Every interaction was friendly and happily concluded . This is a great place to hold AN ##Y event . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco is in a great location in Chicago . The staff is extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Upon check in , I was upgraded to a room with a view of the river . The free wine from 5 - 6 every evening is a nice touch and the food provided at our business meetings was creative and delicious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located in Chicago with eve ##yt ##hing nearby this is an ideal easy going ( business ) hotel . Room ##s are spacious and hotel features some funny aspects like breakfast on your own floor and drinks for residents in a hide away bar . Staff is friendly and makes you feel comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great Hotel for our short city break . Walking distance to the shopping area and a short cab ride away from everywhere else . Thanks to Perry and D ##wayne . . . funny , friendly and helpful . . . they made our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here before and was in town for a concert so was not at the hotel much . However , the de ##cor is modern , room was super clean , staff was friendly . I AL ##WA ##Y ##S can rely on Swiss ##ote ##l ! It is a little hard to find on GPS and some friends did have trouble finding it but the staff actually sat on the phone with them to help ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay here . It was very clean and easily accessible . It was very reasonably priced and our view was out of sight . The room was surprisingly small , but the kitchen had most everything we needed . The staff were very friendly ! Ask for a room with a view - you will not be disappointed . It was a great time ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed Christmas Eve . The room was a good size for a downtown hotel . We had a lovely b ##uff ##et breakfast Christmas morning in the lobby restaurant . The room was quiet . I recommend a lake view . It ’ s walking distance to Grant Park and “ The Bean ” . You can see Buckingham Fountain from the hotel . Very lovely views . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff are very friendly , welcoming and helpful . The rooms are updated , clean and well setup . Love the daily happy hour ( 5 - 8 ##pm ) with a wonderful staff . Also the morning continental breakfast is quite extensive and so convenient on each floor . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , the Loop and River North . Drake at the front desk was very helpful . This is now my favorite place to stay whenever I visit Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really want to give the Public 5 ; but it ' s not a conventional 5 * hotel . It ' s old and magnificent . Great layout ; lovely helpful staff ; comfortable clean rooms and excellent service . Good location on edge of central area but not noisy or heavily traffic ##ked . Well recommended [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located a nice walk from central Chicago this place is a great option . The rooms were large , with the bed and pillows extremely comfortable . Would easily stay here again , particularly with Buddy Guys around the corner ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you ’ re in the city and you ’ re a swimmer - this hotel is for you . Amazing pool for lap swimming . The location is outstanding for both getting to the office and for night ##life and shopping . Staff is very friendly and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was taking a class at Chicago Booth and this was absolutely the best place to stay . There was so much in walking distance and was absolutely beautiful . Only issue I had was the A / C , they had to come a fix it a few times . I would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , we went in March so cold weather was expected but it wasn ' t that bad . This hotel is right on the loop so great views no matter where you are . Also the gym was huge and had amazing views as well . Clean , and cater ##ed to our every need ! We also caught the premiere showing of Batman vs . Superman across the street at the movie theater so that was great as well . We shall return and most likely stay here every time we go to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I looked for hours and hours for a hotel in Chicago . This place was perfect . Best location , cute bout ##ique hotel with modern finishes . Gorge ##ous room . Great service . Wine hour in the evenings ! What more could you ask for ! ? We were very happy and would totally stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is located close to many restaurants , stores and businesses . Co ##m ##fort ##able and quiet rooms made for a relaxing stay . The hotel was very clean and I felt safe knowing that . Especially with the situation we are dealing with currently . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was in Chicago for a class reunion and stayed at the Hilton . It is a beautiful old hotel with all the modern amenities but with added historic style . When in Chicago , you can ' t find a better hotel experience . Stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose to stay at the Palmer House Hotel for its wonderful lobby and fantastic location close to the Art Institute and the Chicago River in the heart of downtown Chicago . The rates are very reasonable . We loved sitting in the lobby having a cocktail and imagining the Palmer ##s ' Gil ##ded Era . The bed was comfortable and the room , while small , had lovely photographs and vintage inspired furniture . Would love to stay again on another trip and possibly upgrade to a bigger room , but we were out and about on the town , so it suited us just fine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House Chicago is a class act bar none . Old school service throughout and great city location make this a can ' t miss hotel . Even if you ' re interest in Miracle Mile shopping , just hop on the State St bus up & down . Or super easy L stop off of W ##aba ##sh . I highly recommend executive level rooms for am / pm eats & drinks which essentially amount to full meals + dedicated elevators for super quick access to room and lobby levels without the wait ! And the ex ##ec level staff are absolutely te ##rri ##fic ! Any time in the lobby is a sanctuary unto itself and rewards with historic am ##bian ##ce and class . Look for nearby cheaper in / out parking options to make your visit complete . Ma ##hal ##o to the Palmer House Hilton [SEP]
0	[CLS] My friend and I had a wonderful experience at the Talbot ##t hotel from the moment we stepped inside . We were greeted by D ##wayne , who has the best hospitality we could ' ve asked for . He helped us to our room and immediately saw that we wanted a better view . D ##wayne called to the front desk and was able to get our room changed with a much better view ! Finally , before D ##wayne left he gave us several spots to try in Chicago that were delicious fun and affordable . I would recommend this hotel to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Off ##ers Excellent location , clean , well staffed , excellent security , exceptional bell staff with good solo dining / bar options . Con ##ven ##ient to River ##walk , tours , shopping , restaurants , and more . Will stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the second year we have stayed at the Palmer House when traveling on a Bus Trip with co - workers and friends . If you are looking for modern and trend ##y this is not the hotel for you . If you want an beautiful and historic hotel that will cater to all of your needs and place you in the heart of the city , I encourage you to look at the Palmer House ! The lobby is a piece of art . The details and crafts ##manship are something long lost in more modern hotels . Step out the door and you can walk to theaters , restaurants , shopping , the Bean , lake shore and more . We found the price to be reasonable as well . Cho ##ose the Palmer House and you will not regret it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome location but crap ##y hotel . No view at all from any room . Everything dirty and smell ##y . Hotel room was ok I booked this one as it had 2 double beds . El ##eva ##tor were out all the time had to wait all the time 15 + min ##s . Services was crap ##y tone of the front office was not good . Ex ##pen ##sive restaurant . Good close to 360 Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the All ##egro when we went to Chicago to see Hamilton . It is very convenient ##ly located to Chicago ’ s theaters , to the Art Institute , to lots of good restaurants and to the Blue Line train from O ’ Hare . The price was reasonable . Like every Kim ##pton I ’ ve stayed in , the de ##cor was interesting and comfortable , the staff was friendly and helpful , and everything was clean and user friendly . I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Reason ##ably priced hotel for a brief family 3 day weekend vacation Clean , sea ##m ##less check ##in , lovely staff . Easy to reach from airport via train . Nice time and near Michigan Avenue for shopping and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I believe this was my 3rd visit to this hotel . It is great for business trips but I would not hesitate to stay here on a weekend trip with my hub ##by . Good location , nice size rooms ; continental breakfast on each floor . Fitness room is average and they give you token ##s for happy hour ! Staff was very nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I took my family here ( young kids . . . ages 3 - 7 ) , and it was wonderful ! The accommodation ##s were perfect ( with a junior suite , so the kids were in the beds and my wife and I shared the pull - out sofa ) , the pool was a pleasant addition , especially since it was the cold ##est April in Chicago in a long time , and the milk - and - cookies and adventure kits they gave our kids at the start of the trip were superb . The view was lacking ( we looked directly at another building ) , but being right on the Ma ##g Mile in Chicago was excellent ! I love staying at O ##m ##ni hotels around the US , and I will look to stay at this one again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 2 nights . Very spacious , clean , nice , bright , comfortable room . Nice breakfast on every floor . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary drink at the bar . A ##wes ##ome awesome awesome location ! ! ! ! Close to everything both tourists locations as well as bars and restaurants [SEP]
0	[CLS] Such a great experience ! From checking in to dining to customer service , everyone was beyond friendly and helpful . This was by far the nice ##st hotel experience we have ever had ! The location was very central to great restaurants and tourist spots as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel has been renovated since our last visit and is very nicely done . Check ##in was easy and efficient . Our room was ready as requested . We were on an upper floor with a nice river view . The staff went over board helping us . Only issue was due to the current health situation some services were not available such as breakfast and restaurant was closed . Internet service was reasonable but slow . We will most definitely recommend this hotel and plan to stay here again . The parking garage is very easy for in and out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the Chicago blues playing as you enter , to the wonderful room service , this is Chicago . I was especially impressed with the room service which came from the excellent restaurant next door . Great bar ##be ##cue slide ##rs , and Mac and Ch ##eese with pepper ##s and burnt ends . Excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My buddy Robert Ramos , hooked me up with a nice suite 82 ##4 was the room , real nice for the $ $ $ . I am looking forward to the next visit and plan on booking the same room . I really like the size of the suite verses the $ $ [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy the ceiling , then walk over to the bar area and have their Famous Brand ##y Alexander . This hotel has a helpful staff and con ##cier ##ge people that will help you plan an excellent day in Chicago . The location of this hotel offers patrons easy opportunities to enjoy the city without much walking . And the historical venue is a must for visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location for Chicago family vacation . Easy walks to Navy Pier , water taxi / river tour , shopping , restaurants and more . Very clean room and common areas . Stay ##ed in updated Executive Tower Suite . Building very cool re ##mo ##del ##ed Art Dec ##o original . Heavy construction / renovation next door at Tribune building , but hardly noticeable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I like the hotel . But the air ##con blows onto the bed which is annoying and they put money on your credit card on hold so you can not spend that money , even if you have paid for the room up ##front . This makes no sense when you have paid for the room and they are still taking money for the room . They need to have a better way of knowing who has paid and who hasn ’ t . Being such a big company very bad management . Also they charge you for drink that you didn ’ t have , so suggest checking your bill not putting key into check ##out box near reception . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent staff - very friendly and helpful - and great accommodation ##s . I was surprised at how well laid out the room was , and it didn ' t feel cramped like most city hotels . Also , the food was excellent at the restaurant , the room service , and the events held at the hotel . What more can you ask for ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was the first time that I ' ve been to Chicago and I ' m glad we stayed at the H ##ya ##tt . The staff was very professional and once you are at the hotel you don ' t need your car . Walking distance to do whatever your heart desires to do . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great area to stay and Rosemary is the best and nice ##st person . She was super friendly and went over and above to help me if I needed towels or room cleaned at certain time . The whole staff is great but Rosemary was truly awesome ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every time I visit Chicago , this is my Go ##T ##o place to stay . Great customer service , staff is very friendly , they always make things right if there is a little hi ##cc ##up . Location is AM ##A ##Z ##ING , walking distance to most places . Best restaurant staff and bar staff downstairs ! Stacy the bartender is the best ! Not too fancy , but for the price , it ’ s the best in ch ##ica ##go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a single room with a king size bed . Small ##est hotel room , closet and bathroom I ’ ve ever seen but it was beautifully decorated , very clean and comfortable , and in excellent condition . I stayed 3 days and was very pleased with the room and the service . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel while visiting Chicago for my first time . It was a perfect location and I felt very safe being a solo business woman . The staff were very friendly and helpful . The room was very clean and spacious . I loved re ##tri ##ev ##ing my continental breakfast each morning just down the hallway with the in - room tray . I can ' t wait to stay again . . . and on vacation next time . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Located in an excellent area , the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile hotel provides an excellent breakfast , with amazing , spacious rooms . However , the staff are truly what make this hotel stand out ! Our hostess , Din ##ka , made us enjoy our stay even more through her friendly and helpful attitude at breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service , location , people , food , and am ##bian ##ce . Total ##ly enjoyed my stay . Will stay here again whenever in Chicago . Came for a weekend with my son who also enjoyed the room and location . So much to see and do in that area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I have a history of staying in some nice hotels near the lake ##front and River ##walk , Swiss ##ote ##l by far knocked it out of the park ! The location and ease of parking was te ##rri ##fic – access to the River ##walk and the lake ##front were steps away . Special shout out to ER ##ub ##y for really el ##eva ##ting our stay from special to exceptional ! High ##ly recommend that everyone takes the time to check out the hotel , I attached two photos from our hotel room on the six floor E ##ru ##by - Thank you making our anniversary amazing and memorable ! ! May 2018 [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super Friendly Staff ! Door ##man ( Hussain ) went above and beyond helping us to our room . Front desk G ##G was amazing even calling me an hour before my arrival and greeting me as I began check in . Would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great central ##ly located hotel , but the highlight is the customer service . S ##hout ##out to C ##ait ##lin from the con ##cier ##ge team , super helpful before my arrival . Every team member was super helpful and the room was well appointed . Clean and great bathroom amenities . There is construction happening , but did not experience any noise during my stay . They were pro ##active and placed a letter and ear plug ##s in the room to help . Great to see a hotel try to get ahead of an opportunity outside of their control . Another added bonus was the compliment ##ary coffee station the lobby each morning , simple and nice touch . Very happy with this stay and will return again when heading back to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I value clean ##liness , quiet , safety , and good restaurant options within the hotel . My stay was wonderful thanks to staff that ensured that the hotel was safe , quiet , clean , and persona ##ble interactions with them . Chicago was still under CO ##VI ##D restrictions and that made food and beverage options limited . The lack was not an imp ##ed ##iment because some items were available for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . Nearby restaurants and delivery services made up for the lack . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for Chicago marathon . Got allocated a room on the 24th floor . Quiet , comfortable and room ##y . Perfect for those times when you want to be off your feet . A short train ride to the ex ##po and the route passes directly by the hotel at mile 1 . So my wife could ni ##p downstairs and watch us pass before watching other runners out of the window when having her breakfast . With a Whole Foods a couple of blocks away we weren ’ t re ##lian ##t on massive US sized portions in all the restaurants . Would stay here again on marathon weekend [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , location location ! Just a handful of minutes from : Millennium Park ' s P ##ritz ##ker Pa ##vil ##lion where outstanding summer evening concerts are held ; s ##tor ##ied shopping on Michigan Ave : and relaxing River ##walk . Front desk staff is quite at ##ten ##tive and professional . Our room with an amazing corner view was clean , yet a bit worn around the edges . House ##keeper missed a few spots in the bathroom and in ##bet ##we ##en the sofa and entertainment table , but nothing a quick phone call and vacuum could handle . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Court ##eous , re ##ps ##ons ##ive and engaging staff , great food service at the meet and greet provided by the O ##m ##ni . Room was as expected . Great central location , walking distance to all shopping , restaurants and attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful long weekend in the Wind ##y City . The hotel ’ s location was perfect for our shopping trips and we had numerous restaurants within walking distance , the breakfast served at the hotel was delicious . The entire staff was helpful and court ##eous . The house ##keeping staff was excellent , especially Rosemary Miller . She went out of her way to help make our stay comfortable . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and have always been happy with the location , service and rooms . This stay was very disappointing . When we arrived at 6 : 30 PM on Friday we were told that the room we booked ( two doubles ) was not available because VIP ’ s had not checked out yet . This made no sense . The room was not very clean when we checked in . The double roll away bed they promised turned out to be a twin . The following day , when I returned to the room at 3 : 45 it had not been cleaned . I requested that it be cleaned right away as we needed to get in the room . As of 4 : 30 the room had still not been cleaned . This is unacceptable for an alleged 4 star hotel . I will not stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay and the staff was very friendly and helpful . K ##wa ##me at the front desk was especially helpful . Craig ##s ##list also provided us with great tips for getting around . The hotel is convenient ##ly located in easy walking distance of stores , great restaurants and the bus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location and clean , close to the pier and beach and good restaurants but expensive and they charge too much for anything Can not store personal items in the fridge ! No microwave in the room or in the floor [SEP]
1	[CLS] average , good price , clean bathroom , but the in ##vo ##ice bill not not accurate , location is great but no nice view from the room , good and quite room , very good for solo bus ##sin ##ess trip , the rooms was small although , [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice rooms , beautiful facility , the reception , door ##man , bar employees and bi ##stro employees were welcoming . I had to extend my stay and was able to call reservations , while taking a “ l ##y ##ft ” , they were able to accommodate me with no issues , I didn ’ t even need to get my credit card out , N ##IC ##E ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment you enter the hotel , u can feel the So ##fit ##el perfume , smells incredible , friendly stuff , the co ##zy good atmosphere . Oh ##hh the bed , w ##ow I thought Hilton have comfortable mattress , no way . . . . now we discovered So ##fit ##el bed , you won ’ t believe it , you will want that bed at home : ) . Inc ##red ##ible location , so close to everything , and oh ##hh , don ’ t forget to try Te ##mpo Cafe , is right on the corner of the street , as y go out of the hotel , is just on the right side — - DE ##L ##IC ##IO ##US everything . Room ##s so clean , and the La ##n ##vin Collection in the bathroom was a good touch . Sorry Hilton , now I am a So ##fit ##el fan ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very good experience at this hotel . Staff was exceptional and de ##cor was smash ##ing ! The lighting was particularly elegant . Con ##cier ##ge was very inform ##ative and helpful and booked an architectural ferry trip for us . The location of this hotel is excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing ##ly poor service - wish I could give a 0 rating . No house ##keeping service unless you ask . The ceiling collapsed in one of the two bathroom ##s we paid a high price for . Hotel offered us either a move to a smaller room at the same cost - which was high - or $ 50 off per night , which hardly compensate ##d for the has ##sle . Staff in and out of our room late at night and early in morning to ask questions they would have known answers to if they communicated with one another . Hotel b ##ot ##ched me ##ager discount at check - out . Three calls to the hotel later , still don ' t have promised discount , and it appears they have now double - charged my card for the stay . If you want a peaceful stay with nice service and not to be stolen from , don ' t stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel ' s ballroom is f ##abulous , but aside from that , there is nothing about the hotel that suggests it ' s an historic building . The room was small , which doesn ' t bother me , but the carpet was very dirty to the point that I didn ' t take my shoes off until I was in bed . The front desk person was very pleasant , and the hotel restaurant staff were okay , but despite the fact that we got a deal on the room , there were outrage ##ously high costs for everything . Vale ##t parking was $ 70 per night , breakfast for two ( eggs Benedict and coffee ) was $ 45 . 00 , and there was a facilities fee ta ##cked onto the bill too . I was happy to leave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We made reservations at the Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago for two nights during the marathon weekend . We stayed in a spacious suite which featured gorgeous views of Lake Michigan as well as the city ##sca ##pe . The hotel is the perfect location for the Chicago Marathon , a short walk to the co ##rra ##ls in Grant Park . The service , especially the front desk , was friendly and helpful . Stay ##ing at the Swiss ##ote ##l made our first visit to Chicago extra memorable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I absolutely loved my stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago just a quick walk up the block from The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and I L ##O ##VE ##D everything about this hotel from my s ##ty ##lish room with a view , friendly staff and the wonderful , craft cocktail ##s at the bar . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed only one night while in Chicago and glad I choose this hotel . The room and view was f ##abulous and what I would expect from a hotel downtown . I had an issue with a third party booking site however Ki ##a at the front desk went above and beyond to make sure my stay was pleasant . When I come back to Chicago I will choose this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central hotel with f ##rench atmosphere . The staff is friendly and helpful . The rooms ( ours were on the 29th and 23rd floor ) are nicely done up and provide a beautiful view . However , upon arrival they were both not clean - unfortunately a problem that persisted throughout the entire stay . Except for the lacking clean ##liness a good choice for your stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent room at the Hilton - were given an upgrade on check in and had a partial view of lake Michigan . Pool was excellent . Was close to everything . Travel from the airport to Hotel by Train . At ##tend many local sights - sea ##rs tower , cruise on Lake Michigan , cycle ##d around the fore ##shore , lake cruise and bus tour . High ##light was the Baseball at W ##rig ##ley Stadium followed by deep dish pizza at Lou Main ##tani ' s . Would highly recommend a stay here and was very economical . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a conference . Check in was sub par . AC was not working when we arrived at the room . Maintenance fixed the issue in under an hour ( maintenance staff extremely nice and efficient the rest of the front staff should learn from this guy ) . On site bar was extremely poorly staffed during peak hours . Staff was never friendly even seemed annoyed for you wanting to get something at the bar ( I do not recommend going there ) . F ##ac ##ilities were ok for an aging hotel . At ##e at the restaurant one evening , food and service were good . Location was prime with our wonderful room views . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great ! We get a junior suite and it ’ s perfect for a family of four ( with a 9 ##yo and 13 ##yo ) . It ’ s a corner room , with enough space for everyone & generally great views as well . Room ##s are modern ( relative to other nearby hotel options ) and clean . I agree with the reviews that are critical about the service - in particular , it takes wa ##aa ##ay too long to check - in . One would think they could fix a known , repeated problem . This issue is not enough to keep us away - we come back again & again because of location & room size . In fact , we walk down to the Palmer House because of their historic , gorgeous lounge . . . but , AL ##WA ##Y ##S stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really good basic internet . O ##op ##la 50 + download 25 + up ##load . Great location near the Chicago loop . A bit spend ##y but it ' s Chicago . Go for it . Good access to bus routes . 3 day all you can eat bus pass in Chicago is $ 20 + $ 5 for the vent ##ra pass . This will get you back and forth to O ' Hare on the blue line and every where you need to go on the L and the buses when you are in town . This is a d ##ynamite deal if you can work w ##th the go ##og ##le map mass transit directions . This will even get you up to W ##rig ##ley on the Red line to watch the Cubs crush the opposition . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First off , the design of the interiors are gorgeous . Check out the basement to see p ##ics of all the stars who have stayed here over the years . Next we were concerned about our accommodation ##s . . . The front desk manager met with me personally to hear what my concerns were and went above and beyond to ensure I was happy . A true first class hotel . Check out the bar in the lounge by the fireplace for a co ##zy place to sit and also try the restaurant it is beautiful . great place for a night out and great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] l booked the hotel because of a great rate , but had heard of the Kim ##pton Brand and was excited to try it out . I mentioned it at check in and Ronald took amazing care of me , giving me a room facing the river with a window seat . The location was te ##rri ##fic , close to the River , restaurants and the CT ##A , making it super easy to get there from Midway when I arrived , and back to Midway when I left . I travel often for work , and love to get to Chicago when I can , so the window seat facing the river was f ##abulous . The room was clean and spacious , w ##if ##i easy to access , and plenty of outlets in the room for charging . One last fun note , the room had Ch ##ee ##tah print robes ! I was only there for one night but was really wishing I could stay longer . I will absolutely be staying with Kim ##pton again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As always , the Kim ##pton exceeds my expectations ! I messed up my dates and they went out of the way to fix our reservation . Room ##s were great . Say ##ed on 16th floor , no noise problems at all . Very central ##ly located . Would definitely recommend ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price I paid , I should have got white glove treatment ! This place was awful . The check in staff are not friendly ( perhaps they were busy because it was memorial day weekend ) and the front desk was NO ##T adequately staffed . Considering it was a holiday weekend , there were only 2 check in staff on a long counter that could have accommodate ##d up ##to 8 staff members ! The room was din ##gy looking , dusty , and dim ##ly lit . No wash ##cloth ##s were given to me . My cream ##er cu ##rd ##led in my coffee when I br ##ew ##ed it . The wall paper was tearing from the walls . My AC wasn ' t working . This was not what I expected ! I felt like I was at a 2 - star hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is lovely and central ##ly located , but the best thing is the staff . Everyone is so friendly and helpful . We were there during a very busy city - wide convention and it was a pleasure . We especially enjoyed meeting Dar ##nell ##a , who works at the fitness center . Be sure to say hello to her when you go , her smile will make your day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quiet , comfortable rooms , excellent service , and a good restaurant make the So ##fit ##el a good choice if you want to be in the center of things . Very walk ##able location . Many restaurants , shopping and Lake Michigan are nearby . Mill ##eni ##um Park , Art Institute and Field Museum are a little over one mile away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] booked on Hotels . com and stayed Dec 29th - Jan 1st Pro ##s : clean , friendly and helpful staff , comfortable room . very central to everything around downtown and great convenient parking option right across the road with 401 parking garage Con : this cost 2 stars , the hidden fee aka " Des ##tina ##tion Fe ##e " of $ 16 / night which covers W ##IF ##I and free bottle ##d water and whatever else the fine print described , very much a rip ##off and un ##ju ##st ##ified additional cost [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel a number of times . It always is a wonderful experience . Ra ##quel at the front desk was extremely helpful which only enhanced an already great experience . On my most recent trip , 3 / 29 - 3 / 31 I was treated to compliment ##ary champagne for my birthday ! When I arrived to my room from a s ##tro ##ll around Millennium Park I found the champagne sitting on ice with two glasses for my girlfriend and I . There is no doubt that this hotel is committed to an im ##men ##s ##ly quality customer experience . Their hospitality is un ##mat ##ched and when you couple that with their gorgeous rooms / views it makes for everything one can ask for in a stay . As always , I will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I stayed for nearly two weeks at the Talbot . Our room was large and very comfortable . The John ##ath ##an Adler products in the bathroom were nice as well ; it ’ s great to see hotels using full size products to minimize plastic waste . Also , the location of the hotel couldn ’ t be more perfect ! I wanted to shout out our wonderful housekeeper Rosemary Miller who kept our room in great shape . Can ’ t wait to return to this property ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff are friendly , the rooms are large , clean , and nice . The gym is decent and the hotel itself is central ##ly located . However the walls are thin and I could here every cough and toilet flush from next door and my room was across from a house ##keeping closet and they were extremely loud coming in and out of there . Also my coffee maker smelled like sour milk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel Lo ##bby is beautiful . Unfortunately the House ##keeping De ##pt doesn ' t have the Professional ##ism that would be expected . I wouldn ' t stay at this Hotel again . The Restaurant was f ##abulous and the con ##cier ##ge ( Hilton Ambassador ) was Great ! ! Thank you Moe for making my stay worth while ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My trip to Chicago was bitter ##s ##weet , as I was both attending a family memorial service and visiting friends . Stay ##ing at the Public was the perfect choice : quiet location , perfectly clean and minimal ##istic rooms , gorgeous building and architecture , central local ##e , and f ##abulous bar / restaurant amenities ( P ##ump Room ) . Travis at the front desk welcomed me with my favorite cookies , drinks , and magazines on display in my room when I arrived . He was also extremely knowledge ##able about restaurant and bar recommendations and made me feel at home among the staff . He is a stand ##out in the hospitality world . Excellent stay overall - - I can ' t wait to return ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I attended a 3 - day workshop at the O ##m ##ni Hotel . I was impressed by my room , and I wished I could extend my stay . The food they cater ##ed for the workshop was really good . The hotel staff were friendly and warm . The only issue I had was that most of the TV channels were not active , so there weren ' t a lot of options for entertainment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is very nice . Very clean and class ##y but room was extremely small and the bathroom was teen ##y . We had a room with a queen bed . Work ##ed for one night . Could hear neighbors and hallway activity too much . But I would stay again if I got as good of a deal ( $ 130 ) . This small of a room would be best for just one person , not a couple . Unfortunately , we had to pay for parking a few blocks away as no cheap hotel parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our location with lots around for eating , shopping and sights ##ee ##ing ! Easy access to other places nearby via cab / u ##ber / bike which made ##s things easy . The staff was very friendly and our meals there were very good high quality . We traveled with our adult son for a college football game but took in the Cubs and Bears as well and we saw so much ! Architectural tour and city bikes were fun [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a fantastic stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago for my birthday . The hotel is in a great location but the Con ##cier ##ge Maris ##a de Fe ##lice took it to another level . Friendly , efficient and so easy to deal with . Answer ##ed all our questions . Thank you Maris ##a . You certainly added greatly to our Chicago experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] it was awesome and enjoyed the trip . The hotel was ideal ##ly located and we walked to Michigan avenue to do some shopping . We had tickets to " Hamilton " and reservations at some exceptional restaurants . Everything was within walking distance . We walked the pier along the lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I don ’ t write reviews often , but I ’ m happy to write one about Fair ##mont ! The rooms were spacious and comfortable , the staff was wonderful , the food was delicious , and the Gold Lounge was an absolute treat ! Also , if you ever need any assistance , the Gold Lounge staff was exceptionally helpful ; they really went the extra mile ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 4 nights while in town for work . I was upgraded to the Ser ##eni ##ty Suite and it was amazing . From the de ##cor to the artwork and the view . I still cannot get over the views out the massive windows . Every staff member I encountered was great . I love the little details in the room especially the art in the bathroom tile and the bird handles on the bathroom van ##ity . Abdul and Michael are awesome . Thanks for making my stay comfortable . I have stayed at all 4 properties in Chicago and this one is tied for 1st with the Gray . I am looking forward to being back again . I am a Kim ##pton fan and love staying at as many properties as possible . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at Hotel Monaco was wonderful ! The hotel is decorated beautifully , from the lobby to the guest rooms and guest bathroom ##s . Everyone was so friendly and at ##ten ##tive . It was a pleasant experience from check - in to check - out . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great hotel . Very no ##stal ##gic ! Great service . Friendly staff ! ! It was my birthday and they delivered champagne and chocolate to my room ! I would stay there again and also recommend to anyone going to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco lived up to its 4 star rating . My family spent 3 nights there during Thanksgiving week . The gentleman at the front desk noticed that my wife and I were traveling with our 3 young children and was g ##rac ##ious enough to upgrade our room to a suite without hesitation . Our room was beautiful and the kids loved hanging out on the com ##fy window seats . The room had a very modern and spacious bathroom which was great to see . All of the staff was very helpful and court ##eous and were a joy to interact with . T ##h complementary coffee and wine happy hour were a nice touch as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff is very friendly and the location is perfect ! I love that the area is quiet ##er for walking around but still close to everything . Beautiful ##ly appointed room with amazing views ! I would recommend this hotel to everyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice location . Close to washing ##ton park . Good food in the restaurant and the hotel staff are very help ##fu and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . The hotel is a new addition to H ##ya ##tt and seems to still in the transition phase and staff ##s are not familiar with world of h ##ya ##tt program based on my experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the bout ##ique feel to the hotel ! Clean rooms , nicely decorated in Art Dec ##o fashion with a great lounge / window seat in the room . Hotel restaurant for breakfast had very fresh ingredients , well prepared and insane ##ly fast service . Fe ##lt like there were so many places within walking distance of the property , but plenty of cab ##s available too . Would absolutely come back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] First time in Chicago , and absolutely loved it . I stayed in this hotel for only two nights , I was in town for a wedding and the groom recommended this hotel for having a great location , at a reasonable price . The hotel is very modern , very clean , very comfortable , and I really enjoyed every bit of it including the breakfast food , and service from the reception ##ist , and the heated indoor pool . Very recommended for a a few nights in this great city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d this hotel . First time to Chicago , looking for an apartment with my daughter who is moving there . Gorge ##ous hotel , incredible staff , and I couldn ' t have asked for a better location . You can walk anywhere from here . We explored downtown , Gold Coast , Old Town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 5 nights in April 2017 . The hotel is a short walk from Michigan Avenue and a metro stop . Travel to and from O ' Hare airport by train was not difficult ( one transfer ) . We booked a luxury room with city view on a high floor ( therefore , the room was very quiet ) . Service was excellent and the con ##cier ##ge was helpful whenever we had questions . We like to walk and it took about 20 - 25 minutes to reach Du Sa ##ble bridge , where we took one of Chicago ' s First Lady cruise ##s ( highly recommended to make reservations - it was probably our favorite activity in Chicago ) . We did not eat breakfast in the hotel . There are many restaurants at all price ranges in the area . Would definitely consider staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We are having an excellent stay here ! Each employee we have met has gone above and beyond for us . In particular Jay the ma ##î ##tre d at 720 breakfast was lovely . He put us first and took great care of our family while we enjoyed our morning meal . While staying at the Hilton Chicago be sure to also have breakfast here . The food is amazing and the service is even more so . [SEP]

Can ’ t stress the pillows enough , most hotel have foam pillows . . . . but not this one . Fe ##ather ##s ! ! The staff was great , very re ##sp ##ons ##ive to all requests and the bar and bar food was exceptional , let ’ s hope nothing changes when the H ##ya ##tt takes over , which is very soon . [SEP]

0	[CLS] On our recent second visit to P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago , were delighted to find the same exceptional service , food and warm hospitality we had enjoyed before . Some of the staff who made this visit so enjoyable were Danny the M ##g ##r . , Alex , S ##yl ##vie , and Steve as well as Tan ##ish ##a in house ##keeping who was such a delight . Can ' t wait to stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is massive , but easy to navigate . Our room was medium - size , but with a stellar view of the river and beyond it , the lake . At night , boats going up and down the river looked so pretty . The room was quiet and super clean , and the bed com ##fy . The bathroom was not tiny , but far from big . No bubbles , al ##as , for the tub . Everyone we met working at the hotel ( front desk , house ##keeping , restaurant ) was very , very nice . A good experience all in all . And literally on top of the river ##walk . Great location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently visited Chicago for pleasure and had a wonderful experience ! The room was clean , there was security involved , it was nicely decorated for Christmas and the front desk staff was great . I look forward to visiting again soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great amenities and location to shopping , the lake or business areas . Staff is friendly and rooms are generous in size and well appointed - N ##ess ##press ##o machines ! ! ! The hotel offers great dining options as well as a rooftop bar with simple foods and a great view of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good place to stay with great location and good prices . Staff is friendly and hotel is clean and nice . Close to the ma ##gni ##ficient mile and other attractions . A fireplace in the lobby would make the lobby much more enjoyable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador is our favorite Chicago hotel . Each stay is unique in this historic hotel . The management is always working on improvements ( One elevator is currently down for replacement ) but the hotel retains excellent staff and a special atmosphere . We really enjoyed our morning coffee and tea in the Library . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bathroom stalls looks like it has not been cleaned . There were black soap s ##cum and marks throughout the bath stall floor tiles and corners . Hotel mess ##es up our room re ##ceipt ##s when we checked out and charged us for another room and a smoking fee . Neither my b ##f or I smoke and I dislike the smell of smoke . They offered re ##fu ##nd but will be keeping an eye out on our statement until we actually receive the re ##fu ##nd . [SEP]
1	[CLS] first the check in was perfect . Makes you fell welcomed and front desk staff are smiling . Con ##cier ##ge were also giving an incredible service . The Door ##man always opens the door before you get to the door . Room was very nice and comfortable especially the beds and linen . Bar is also well located near lobby and good service . As for Location you cannot ask for better . close to everything and walk ##able [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved early for check in but although our room wasn ' t ready we were offered a different room so that we could go straight there which was very welcome after an 8 hour flight . Very welcoming staff at reception . Room was very clean and t ##idy so after a brief fresh ##en up we decided to go for a walk around Chicago . The con ##cier ##ge not only gave us a map but pointed out several areas of interest as we had limited time in the city and it made it very easy for us to see most of them . We were also able to store our cases secure ##ly the following day so that we could enjoy more of the sites whilst waiting for our evening train . Restaurant not quite so good , food was a bit b ##land and rather expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pleasant stay . Room was clean and comfortable . Staff is all friendly . They sent me text messages upon check ##in , during stay , and after check ##out to make sure I enjoyed my stay . I would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As always our stay was excellent , very enjoyable . Food at the restaurant was excellent . Love the location , close to everything and enjoyable neighborhood to walk . Staff is excellent . At ##ten ##tive , professional , respect ##ful and willing to help solve any problem . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was clean , the staff was friendly , and the cleaning staff was on - point . I had an envelope delivered to me at the hotel the day after I flew out of Chicago , and the staff was great about following up with me for next steps with the package . Overall , excellent service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of 2 elevators was broken the majority of our stay and there didn ’ t seem to be a rush to fix it . House ##keeping came once to clean our room during our 4 - night stay . Good location to things . . but these things are just unacceptable . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I didn ' t realize until I was on my way to the hotel that this was a new Conrad property a few blocks from the one I stayed at years ago . I was looking forward to having that kind of experience again , and I was sore ##ly disappointed . This is not at the same level as my previous Conrad stays . I can ' t believe a Conrad that is just a few years old has such dated de ##cor . The rooms and hotel spaces were a 1980s Santa Fe meets Dynasty nightmare . I found the front desk and restaurant service to be fairly me ##h for such a high end property . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not that kind of experience and not worth the money . Just stay at the Palmer House for a lot less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a wonderful location . Near the river , close to shopping . Great restaurants within walking distance . The bar has a great view , the d ##é ##cor is modern . Staff is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stop ##ped here on business trip . Very convenient location . Everything is within easy walking distance whether it be Michigan Avenue and shopping , relaxing in Millennium Park or the countless restaurants that cater to every taste . The staff is always over the top friendly and go out of the way to help in any way possible . The free wine from 5 ##PM until 6 ##PM - how could you possibly go wrong . This is my second trip to a Kim ##berto ##n Hotel and will stop anytime I can ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] everything was ok . modern and clean rooms , comfortable beds , delicious food , friendly staff . . there are a plenty of restaurants , cafe ##s and supermarket ##s nearby . we enjoyed or stay and would love to come back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Love that they just reopened as this place is one of my favorites in Chicago ! ! G ##RE ##AT am ##bie ##nce , service and food ! ! Same de ##cor as previous though so don ' t expect something re ##va ##mp ##ed . Bar is nice too and the or ##bs that create a feeling of space ship dining is fantastic . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Check ##ing in was so smooth and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting thanks to Ke ##enan ' s front desk experience and professional ##ism ! I ' ve been suggesting this specific hotel to E ##VE ##R ##Y ##ON ##E I know due to it ' s simple class ##y comfort and the care I was shown throughout my entire stay ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] David G was our waiter in the restaurant down stairs in the hotel which had delicious food . He was a true professional whose at ##ten ##tive ##ness and personality made me and my sons feel very welcome . This is not our first time staying at this hotel since we love coming in every season for a Chicago Bears game ( F ##Y ##I the hotel is within walking distance of Soldier Field ) . We definitely plan to keep our tradition of staying at the Hilton Chicago every football season and other leisure ##ly visits . We can honestly say that their staff is top notch and deserves all the acknowledge ##ment especially David G . Companies should have more ex ##em ##p ##lary employees like him since he was a true model of amazing hospitality . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Although the hotel has changed hands and had an “ up ##lift the staff has remained the same . Being welcomed home when we enter the hotel by Perry the amazing Bell ##man always makes our trip feel co ##zy and special like were a part of Chicago . Also the food at the restaurant is incredible right now . Don ’ t hesitate to book a trip [SEP]
0	[CLS] B ##rill ##iant hotel and excellent location for everything you will need while your on vacation in a fantastic city , from our arrival to our departure the hotel staff were only too willing and helpful with all our needs . we would thoroughly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A wonderful location and hotel . Very central to all popular a Chicago attractions . My greatest p ##ee ##ve is the poor reservation system set up for special rates for weddings . The reservation desk would not make the reservation , but connected me to an individual responsible for re ##ser ##ving rooms at special rates for weddings . This person NE ##VE ##R picked up the phone and NE ##VE ##R returned messages left on his voice mail . After several repeated attempts , I ended up booking my room at the regular rate . Such poor service is very disappointing for a Hilton hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was gross , old and deteriorated . I ’ m all for vintage , but invest a little money . To ##ile ##t kept running , trash under bed , dust all over furniture , wall ##paper p ##eel ##ing off walls , M ##OL ##D all over ceiling , the list goes on . Called manager and she did not care and just said she will let house ##keeping know . Sounds like these complaints are somewhat common . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we first walked into the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel we were greeted with a smile and very friendly staff . We were told that we had been upgraded to a city view room ( this was awesome ) . Opened our door to our room and w ##ow ! The bed was huge ! ! ! Everything was so clean and looked beautiful . I honestly cannot fault this hotel in anyway . The location was perfect , everything was within walking distance to Michigan Avenue , Millennium Park and most of the tourist attractions . A compliment ##ary breakfast is served every morning on each of the floor levels . I will definitely be recommend ##ing this hotel to my family and friends and when we come back again this is the hotel we ' ll choose ! Thank you Ki ##nz ##ie staff for making us feel comfortable and welcome in your city [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect central location in walking distance of everywhere you ' d want to go . Love ##ly fresh comfortable room . The triangular shape of the building provides fantastic views up and down the river and out to Lake Michigan . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##able stay in the city close to transportation and places we wanted to visit . En ##joy ##ed relaxing on the couch ##es with guests in the evening with some hot tea and conversation . The rooms were simple but clean . Love ##d the healthy food options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely loved staying in the gorgeous Art Dec ##o hotel that offers loads of history , from its painted ceilings , to the sum ##pt ##uous decorations . The guest corridors are aligned with black and white photographer of stars of a by ##gon ##e era who have performed here . Our executive room was large and nicely appointed . Breakfast was good and my daughters were encouraged to have “ seconds ” . The lobby area also great for a morning coffee or early evening drink . Staff friendly and welcoming . Love the fact there are a few shops on lower ground , together with a traditional shoe shine stop . De ##fin ##ite ##ly made our holiday special and we will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t is just the right size to provide personal attention in a European - style hotel . The staff were engaged and the restaurant was excellent . We always recommend the hotel to our friends in Nashville . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We found the Ki ##nz ##ie to be central ##ly located , extremely friendly , spot ##less and a great bargain . Plus we were treated to a free drink and an outstanding app ##eti ##zer b ##uff ##et on the night of our stay . A continental breakfast was put out on each floor . We can ' t wait to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited Chicago for Thanksgiving & love to stay at this hotel . Staff very friendly & a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Location is perfect ! There are restaurants that are great at the hotel or even close enough to walk . We love that millennium park is so close to spend the day at the ice skating rink . Too ##k architectural boat tour which was fun & interesting . Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile is very close to hotel ! You won ’ t be disappointed & we will be back in the future ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel for a training . It is well located , nice people at Front Des ##k , Food service , Gift Shop . Very clean the rooms and specially the bathroom ##s . High quality experience , nice view to the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in an excellent location , is clean , comfortable and staffed by genuinely kind people . It is also really easy to get to by train from O ' Hare ( actually , I think doing so is faster than taking a cab ) . The staff are lovely at this hotel . They are g ##rac ##ious , helpful and friendly . There ' s also some sustainable initiatives which are well thought out . My criticisms are : a ) the coffee in the rooms and at the restaurant is not to my taste and b ) the restaurant is a little price ##y - service is pro ##mpt and friendly , the food is good , so if you ' re pressed for time or don ' t feel like going out , it ' s a good choice but is expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the hotel is well located , and has excellent service . we spent 2 weeks at the hotel , and never had any issue . The rooms are kept very well and the people working at the hotel are very service oriented . I would re ##come ##nd this property to anybody . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always have great luck at Fair ##mont ’ s but not this time . The furniture in the rooms and the bathroom ##s felt very dated . No coffee maker , no house keeping unless you ask for it , no parking on site and only two pillows on a king bed ( so 1 pillow each ) . I get it , co ##vid pre ##ca ##ution ##s but this just seems excessive . I couldn ’ t get out of there fast enough . We left and checked in to Trump International the very next morning . They had all the amenities I expect when traveling . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel and well - appointed , as one would expect for a Fair ##mont . Very disappointed by the $ 20 night ##ly Urban Experience feel that gets you , well , nothing but a $ 5 coffee bar credit . That ' s right - an extra $ 15 / day for amenities that you probably don ' t care about and aren ' t currently available due to co ##vid . Yes - the fee was disclosed - but that doesn ' t make it any better . I expect more from a Fair ##mont . Rai ##se the price by a few bucks and eliminate this ridiculous add - on . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here for a couple nights and it was nothing short of amazing . The room was large , com ##fy and luxurious . The location is great too ! We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go . We loved the view from our room and all the comfort it had to offer . Will definitely stay here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed staying at the O ##m ##ni . The restaurant had some wonderful g ##lut ##en free options . The bed ##ding was very comfortable and rest ##ful . The location was central to excellent g ##lut ##en free restaurants and other venue . The lobby staff was excellent and everything was handled quickly and sea ##m ##lessly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was great . Room was clean and comfortable . E ##ar ##p ##lug ##s were left because the construction may be loud , but we didn ' t have any need for them . Love the wine hour . Love the coffee and tea hour in the mornings . They gave a nice amount of towels and the robes were great . We like Kim ##pton hotels because each one is different . This one had some nice Art Dec ##o touches . Love ##d the pretty , co ##zy spaces in the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So I do al ##ot of travel and most of the time I arrive t ##i hotels and peak hours and I was very impressed at the patience and attitude of E ##ge . He took care of my check - in process and helped me make all the necessary adjustments to my hotel reservation as needed . I will be returning in the future , thank you E ##ge . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended a family wedding and had a great stay ! The rooms were lovely with great views of the city .

0	[CLS] This past weekend I decided to surprise my wife with a trip to Chicago for her 30th birthday . Trust ##ing reviews , and living in Denver , I decided that we would stay at P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago for the weekend . Since it was her birthday I wanted the room to be f ##estive . I was put in touch with Front Des ##k Super ##visor , Travis Howard . Travis went above and beyond what I ever imagined ! ! He was extremely at ##ten ##tive and his attention to detail was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble ! ! It was like I was planning a birthday surprise with a friend . We will be back F ##OR S ##UR ##E and wouldn ' t imagine staying anywhere but P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago . Travis and his staff made a memorable birthday weekend for my wife and I cannot express my gratitude enough ! ! Y ' all are the best ! ! The Hayes ' [SEP]
0	[CLS] It is the perfect place to stay ! ! ! ! Co ##zy but cool ! ! ! ! The only thing I could say was on the down side is that the prices of water , apples and the little things were kinda over priced ! ! ! ! I feel as though some things should just be given when you stay at such a nice place ! ! ! In the morning a l ##il breakfast snack would be nice ! ! ! $ 5 . 00 for the smallest bottle of water is just to much or an apple ! ! ! I know it ' s so l ##il but I was kinda weird ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room very clean spacious Staff we found very friendly helpful Food n ##x ##t door very nice reasonably priced Rob ##es and towels fresh , umbrella nice touch for the rainy season 1st floor room that we had was very nice [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very cleaner , well lo ##cat ##aded , for business travel , workshops and so . The breakfast is very good and the workers very g ##ent ##tles . It ` s lo ##cat ##ted in ##front of Michigan a ##v at the cent ##her of commerce and restaurants , and the best place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very nice stay at So ##fit ##el . The room was very nice and spacious . Service and attention was A + . Great location within the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Close to restaurants , shops , etc . I could definitive ##ly stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location if you ’ re looking for a Chicago vacation . Only problem encountered was house ##keeping knocking on the door two hours before we were scheduled to check ##out . A ##bility to walk to affordable non - hotel places to eat without having to go outside . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed one night in a standard 2 bed room July 13th . We arrived 5 hours before standard check in and the wonderful con ##cier ##ge found us a room that was ready and let us check in early ! The entire staff was fantastic . The room , although small , was beautifully updated and met all of our needs . Would definitely recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Date ##d furniture , uncomfortable bed , dirty , den ##ted lamp shades , lights did not work properly , window shades dirty with holes . There was no coffee in room . Dr ##ink ##s in refrigerator were frozen solid . The only positive thing about this hotel was the door ##men ; they were helpful and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although I stayed here for a conference , I was able to enjoy a little outside leisure time . The location of this property made it easy to get around , whether by foot , public transportation or ride share . The staff go out of their way to ensure comfort and safety . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very much enjoyed this hotel and the location . Friendly staff and many restaurants and shops close by . High ##ly recommend to those who have never been to Chicago and want access ##ability to the city . Restaurant and bar are expensive so I highly recommend going to neighboring establishments . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay at this hotel was awful . The front desk is chaotic and under ##sta ##ffed . The staff seem like they are in constant combat without proper training and a computer system that is often not working causing them to use paper and pencil . My reservation for an Executive King was lost so I was given an ancient double . The room was OK . The bathroom was so poorly laid out that I couldn ' t even comfortably sit on the toilet - since two rolls of toilet paper were j ##ab ##bing into my side . The i - pad with the room service didn ' t work - no one could fix it . They sent a paper copy out the menu to my room . I never got a final bill to reconcile . A ##w ##ful in all regards . The lobby is beautiful - well worth a visit but don ' t check - in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ever been to those old run down hotels in ve ##gas like Ex ##cal ##ib ##ur . This H ##ya ##tt re ##gen ##cy is exactly like that . Not sure of the wonderful reviews as I got mi ##sle ##d by them and booked here . The staff in this hotel has no respect for privacy . I was jet ##lag ##ged and sleeping and I got a call from room service " we saw a do not disturb sign on your room and we are gonna do a room inspection in 15 min ##s because of safety reasons " ah ##h excuse me which hotel In world does inspection for hanging d ##nd sign ? At ##ta ##ching a p ##ic of the blanket which was dusty and old . Very poorly maintained and needs a renovation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fi ##lt ##hy tiny bathroom . Just because you use the word " historic " doesn ##t mean you don ##t have to clean . Our black van ##ity has white stain ##s down the front . You could hear the bathroom above us . We could hear everything in the rooms next to us . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel continues to impress with the great location , wonderful accommodation ##s , delicious food and top notch staff . I true ##ly appreciate the commit ##tment to e ##co friendly practices . I shall return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a large group check in . Staff were always professional . I had some problems , which were very professionally managed by staff . Fed St . Pierre gets a special mention . Thanks Fed . Located on the Ma ##g Mile , close to restaurants , shops Millennium Park , Water Tower . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came in town for he weekend . Room was very clean , bed super comfortable , and staff could not be any nice ##r . Did not get to visit the restaurant or bar but both looked very inviting as well . Would stay here 100 % next time in ch ##ica ##go [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie last week while in town for business . The friend ##liness and professional ##ism of the staff is what I found to be most impressive . No , they didn ' t know me , but they made me feel like they did and treated me like a regular . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I just have to say , I was very happy having chosen the O ##m ##ni in Chicago . I was going to an insurance meeting that was at the Mar ##riot ##t Downtown Miracle Mile . When I signed up for the conference , the Mar ##riot ##t was full . I decided to go to the O ##m ##ni , and boy was I happy I did . They treated me very well . I felt welcome and the room was very nice . I am going to use O ##m ##ni ' s properties much more often , because I have never been disappointed when I have stayed with them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hands Down it does not get any better than this . Originally booked a king but need two beds and the staff fixed it for me on the spot . K ##wan ##e was very helpful in a ##cco ##mo ##dating my needs . The hotel is a ##eth ##est ##ic , with a great location , and I will be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador has so much potential with its location , character building lovely rooms and great door staff and cleaner ##s . The desk staff were also helpful and efficient . B ##UT the bar staff and the Library , casual food and drinks , were app ##all ##ing , slow and it felt as if they were trying ignore us and make everything difficult . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sur ##prise ##d and impressed with the O ##m ##ni service experience . Friendly , warm and personal . E ##ager to accommodate , even gave us a humid ##ifier for our room . Super clean , sleek and modern , and love the suite layout . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a wonderful experience at the Intercontinental last week . The hotel is old and very charming and the rooms are up to date . The staff was fantastic and I loved the room and view . It is a wonderful location and so accessible to the river cruise , hop on hop off , Navy Pier and all of the shopping . The con ##cier ##ge desk with Kathy and Sylvia were te ##rri ##fic ! They recommended several restaurants that were very good , booked our tours for us and were always there to greet us when they were working with a smile and to ask how our day went . I will definitely stay there again the next time I am in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we Stay ##ed the 2 days after Christmas . It was very , very cold . The hotel is right next to Michigan Ave , Rush Street . There is great shopping , all kinds of Pizza ( 3 of the best 2 blocks or less ) and other food ##ie places . The price was great for the region let alone downtown Chicago although parking was a little p ##ric ##y ( let them v ##alet , its the only way to go , very convenient ) . We have been going there for about 5 years after Christmas and it has been updated at least twice in that time . The rooms are very nicely decorated and clean . The open areas have been updated recently and are nice too . Did I mention they have breakfast , coffee bar all day and a evening dinner too . Great place to stay , s ##hh ##hh ! Don ’ t tell anyone . Craig [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is always super friendly . The texts after check - in are a nice touch to ensure you have everything you need to make your visit great . Leah and R ##ubi ##e made the check - in process fun and engaging , arguing over which is better , the left or the right T ##wi ##x ! A great way of having fun at work and bringing the customer into it . All ##egro , you have some amazing people on your staff . [SEP]

1	[CLS] A small lobby could let you think is a bad thing . Not for them . Room ##s are huge , they offer a cock ##te ##il for every night you spend there , very good br ##ek ##fast . Hotel new and clean . Great position , close to metro and city center . Ma ##gni ##ficient mile at 5 min walking . Trump tower in front of ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] I thought a king room would have a tub and the room I booked didn ' t have one but I had a awesome time and the piece and quiet was so good and I know I ' ll be back at the hotel later this year to have a great time again [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my third stay and every time is great - bed comfort , room size , clean ##liness , welcoming atmosphere from the door staff to the luxurious lobby . Excellent staff - very polite and friendly . We shall definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was so clean . The staff was great . So friendly and kind . The hotel is close to so many sites in Chicago . Beautiful part of town . We had a great view of Sears tower and the night view was so pretty . Will be coming back soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##sist ##ently one of the best run hotels . Love the location and the views of the river or the lake are just an added benefit . Palm ##s restaurant in the hotel is an easy choice every trip . Con ##nect ##ed underground to nearby hotels and businesses . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We can ’ t say enough about the Talbot ##t . We were greeted by D ##wayne who looked after our family and wedding party for 5 days . Not only was he efficient in his work , but his kindness was overwhelming . The front desk , especially Jane and Me ##rca ##do , were fantastic and incredibly helpful . The con ##cier ##ge was friendly and efficient . The hotel itself was great , rooms spacious and of high quality . Thank you for a wonderful week and we will be back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had the pleasure of staying at the Conrad hotel in Chicago and really enjoyed our stay . The room was very spacious and had a large bathroom . When I travel having a more spacious room is appreciated and I feel that this room did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . I would most definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A horrible experience . Te ##rrible service , no help in anyway , telephone ##s didn ’ t work , no house keeping , the hotel is old and dirty and the worse thing the employees with no intention the help . Won ’ t go back NE ##VE ##R . Another thing the charge 15 dollars per day for internet and you know it when you arrive [SEP]
1	[CLS] Here for the weekend for I ##GI Chicago Style G ##ym ##nast ##ics Meet 2018 . Very well set up for shut ##tling us to navy pier . The pool was small for the mass of young girls that attended and the interior is not overly impressive as the ceilings are really low in the corridors . While the rate for Chicago was good , the lack of breakfast being included was a real down ##er . The convenience of the shuttle will have me stay again , but if I don ' t need a shuttle I ' ll look for something with breakfast included at a lower cost . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel and the room was clean . The location is prime . The staff were very friendly and helpful . All of this cannot help a hotel with awful beds . I tossed and turned all night . There wasn ' t a flat sheet on the bed ! ! The only thing was the comfort ##er and du ##vet . We ended up using towels as sheets . I could see and feel the springs through the sheets . There wasn ' t a padded mattress cover . We ended up leaving early to get home to real beds I cannot recommend based upon these awful bed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room size was the perfect size for a couple . The room had Excellent lighting ! The staff was very good and I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the city . Next time I ' m in the city I am booking a room here at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great place to stay ! ! ! Staff did a great job ! ! ! We were delighted with the way every detail was handled by the staff making our stay such a wonderful experience . We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone we can . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very s ##ty ##lish hotel in the perfect position to explore Chicago ' s attractions . Very welcoming and very clean - a few personal q ##ui ##rks that made our first visit to Chicago very special . For the service , location and facilities $ 200 per night is a bargain . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Connie in the club lounge was absolutely fantastic she is so on top of her game ! ! She has been so sweet and at ##ten ##tive our entire stay I will come back just to enjoy her service again ! ! Thanks Connie you are amazing ! ! ! ! The hotel was beautiful , I wish the restaurants had longer hours we are not early morning so we missed out on many of the restaurants breakfast times but the room the lounge everything else was amazing [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall stay was memorable and fun . I was upgraded to a suite last minute my the manager , and breakfast was com ##ped after a delay which was an unexpected surprise . There was one incident where the night time attendant was rude when I called about my key not working , but other than that it was an exceptional experience per usual . I ’ d highly recommend this class ##y and historic bout ##ique hotel to anyone visiting Chicago or for a stay ##cation for locals ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Special thank you to Leah for such great accommodation ##s . Travel ##ing with my entire family and she treated us like her family . Hard to find personal ##ized hospitality when traveling yet she delivered perfectly . This will be a trip to remember . Keep up the great work ! ! ! Blake [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at Public Hotel . The bed was com ##fy and overall room was very comfortable - the only concern is that there was no USB available in room despite having a description in the info booklet . We were not sure what was going on in the P ##ump Room as the large curtain was pulled both evenings . We will be sure to consider the Public Hotel for our next trip ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was in Chicago for a convention and the hotel staff were friendly and very at ##ten ##tive . The restaurant was great for breakfast , dinner or just coffee and late night snack . I would definitely recommend this hotel to any travel ##er . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a good hotel . I ' ve stayed here several times before and the staff is always very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The front desk and bell ##men in particular are very helpful . The restaurant is okay but always seems pretty empty . The food is decent but nothing special and certainly a bit price ##y . I don ' t like the w ##if ##i policy at all . The rooms are pretty spacious which is nice . The room de ##cor is not really my style . I ' ve stayed in the river facing rooms and the views are excellent . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds . I think the night ##ly rates are also pretty reasonable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] With my work , I ' m fortunate enough to go to Chicago every August for several days of meetings . I look forward to my trip there as I ' ve gotten to know many of the restaurants and local shops . One of my favorite things is my stay in the She ##rato ##n Grand . . . It truly is a great place to stay . The gym is awesome and looks out over beautiful scenery . It ' s right on the river so you can go out at anytime and sit by the water . The food is W ##ON ##DE ##R ##F ##U ##L and the service is E ##X ##CE ##P ##TI ##ON ##AL and the location is P ##ER ##F ##EC ##T , it ' s just a quick walk over to the Miracle Mile and all that it has to offer . The rooms are also super clean and quiet . The meeting rooms are very convenient too , which makes it great for coming and going . Already looking forward to next year ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] 4th visit to Chicago and 3rd stay at Mill ##eni ##um K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . Re ##ception staff were not friendly or welcoming but rest of stay was excellent . Room was spacious , bed really comfortable and rains ##how ##er excellent . Love the Martin ##i bar - great beers and cocktail ##s , had the small plates one night and really enjoyed . Staff friendly and professional with very at ##ten ##tive service . Only tried Nix for breakfast on 4th and 5th morning and wished we ' d gone earlier as staff and food were excellent and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting in adapt ##ing food as I had been ill . Overall great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for a conference and had a very pleasant stay . The room was comfortable and clean , the elevators moved speed ##ily , and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful . Be fore ##war ##ned though , they ni ##ckle and dim ##e you for everything - a ve ##nding machine soda is $ 3 . 25 , it costs $ 15 - $ 25 to work ##out in the ( very nice ) gym , they charge $ 3 per bag to store your bag if you need to do so before you check in or after you check out , etc . etc . That said , the location really cannot be beat . If you want to be downtown for a reasonable rate , this hotel is a great bet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the She ##rato ##n Grand Hotel is excellent as it is convenient to the miracle mile and many good restaurants . Rafael was the desk person who checked me in and he was extremely efficient and helpful . The renovated room that was assigned to me was well equipped and excellent . The club lounge is nice , but very crowded with families during the summer . Easy check ##out if not checking out on line for Mar ##riot ##t Bon ##voy members . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ok at best . Room ##s need up ##dating . Old stained carpet ##s , mold ##y out ##dated shower units . Dark elevators that took forever to get . Great location . Bar area and front desk staff were professional . Much cleaner places to stay in the same area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Conrad Chicago for 3 nights over a busy weekend and it was one of the best hotel experiences I ' ve had . The beds were super comfortable , the in - room N ##es ##press ##o machine actually made delicious cups of coffee , and the staff were helpful and knowledge ##able . The hotel is distance ##d from busy Michigan Ave ( within a small block ) so it was quiet ##er than the hotels I ' ve stayed at that were right on Michigan . It ' s not a huge hotel , which I also liked . It felt small enough with a nice , at ##ten ##tive staff , while it had all the amenities ( or more ) of a large hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##per ##ien ##cing the lobby alone is worth staying here . It is lovely - two story ceiling with beautiful ornate decoration . Sit and have a drink here . The staff was very helpful , offered us an upgrade that was well worth it . Love ##ly indoor pool . Food good . In the heart of Chicago - lots of shopping and dining right outside their doors . This hotel offers a class ##y , relaxing experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I took a weekend get ##away to Chicago . We wanted to stay right in the middle of the action , but not have to take out another home loan to pay for it . This hotel was perfect ! The location was right in the middle of the action and was one of the " cheap " hotels , but you couldn ' t tell it by the front desk friend ##liness and helpful ##ness . It was also a nice surprise to get small bites and wine and coffee and tea in the lobby . Will definitely stay here again in the future ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Do not spend the money to stay at this hotel . The room was out ##dated and the bed was terribly uncomfortable . I felt like I was sleeping in a bed of hay . When I go on vacation , I really like to sleep well and rest up . This bed was so uncomfortable I really felt like I needed a vacation to rest up from my vacation . The tub area in the bathroom really needed to be updated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The was no room service available , the hotel reminded be a little too much of the shining mostly because of how few guests there were . Location is great and it ’ s history is impressive . Nonetheless I think I ’ d rather stay at a smaller more modern hotel than all alone in this winter fortress . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My 4 day 3 night business stay started with a wonderful reception . I asked for a room on an upper floor and he had plenty of rooms to fulfill my request but suggested a lower floor ( 8 ) on a corner over looking Michigan Ave . Best suggestion ever . I loved the view . The hotel is beautiful ! If you look hard you can see the buildings true age but you have to look pretty hard . I really enjoyed my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went through Price ##line to bid on an unknown location in a hotel downtown Chicago . We were pleasant ##ly surprised to end up here ! Good service & perfect location . About 3 blocks off Mi ##chia ##na Ave & close enough to walk to lots including millennium park . Bed ##s were really comfortable with an amazing shower . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve long been a fan of Kim ##pton hotels for a number of reasons ; 1 . As an architect , I admire their p ##rac ##it ##ce of sensitive ##ly restoring older properties . 2 . Great coffee in the mornings . 3 . Nice wine hour in h ##te evenings , both encouraging guest interaction . 4 . Support of the LGBT community through the Trevor Project . Which brings me to the only 3 star rating . In years of traveling across the US and International ##ly , I have NE ##VE ##R been questioned upon check - in if I realized there would only be 1 bed in the room . NE ##VE ##R . To add salt to the wound , the you ##nd lady at the front desk wouldn ' t accept a " yes , my husband and I are OK with 1 bed " , but continues to ask if she should have a roll - away sent to the room . Never staying here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had an amazing time at The Public Hotel . The staff , rooms and restaurant are spectacular . In particular , Travis Howard truly made our stay so lovely . Thank you for helping us ! We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Mass ##ive Hilton Chicago . magnificent mile and the Bean is nearby . Close to all actions . Very safe . The hotel is more classic de ##co , room is clean . High ##ly recommend . Staff in general are very friendly . Great place for conference or family vacation . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My boyfriend and I visited Chicago for a long weekend and had such a wonderful time ! This hotel was such a g ##em to stay in - right in the middle of the city with lots of things to do and see . The staff were incredibly court ##eous , the hotel room had character and was very clean . Would certainly stay here again on our next trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Beautiful rooms . Very at ##ten ##tive staff . Great value for the price . We often stay at The Peninsula and this hotel was certainly in the same league for a much better price . We ’ ll definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has lots of amenities and the service is excellent . We got an incredible deal for the Thanksgiving weekend for two rooms for our family and it made the trip very enjoyable . The parking is expensive - like all of Chicago but there ’ s a less expensive garage right next door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for just one night , and I wish I could have stayed longer . The staff was incredibly nice , and always willing to help . The location was perfect , it ' s near everything and within walking distance . I had a suite on the 13th floor , the view was great , it was very spacious and clean . The only issue was the internet connection in the rooms , it wasn ' t very good . It worked really well in the public areas . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just had a te ##rr ##ri ##ble experience with the reservation line . Reservation ##ist could not get my name or information right . If this service can get it right , what does it say about the rest of the hotel . Going to another location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The desk staff went out of their way to give us tips during our stay . We were unfamiliar with na ##vi ##gating throughout the city , and they saved us a good amount of money in parking alone . We truly appreciated them going above and beyond . The hotel was extremely clean . V ##ER ##Y comfortable beds ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Joshua at the front desk upgraded our room to a corner room , and was very helpful . He explained everything with detail and was also very friendly . We only stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l when we come to Chicago , highly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and team . Room was perfect after long days working . Re ##lia ##ble w ##if ##i , fitness center renovation is excellent compared to other hotels . Location very convenient . P ##ed ##way access was nice during winter [SEP]
0	[CLS] Service was friendly and helpful . The Chicago location was very convenient and close to where I needed to be for business but also near many restaurants , bars and shopping . Room was nice and very clean . The compliment ##ary breakfast and evening hospitality made the stay more comfortable and gave great value for the money . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am stunned by this hotel chain . We were supposed to be attending a conference here in April but due to the ( lovely ) Co ##rona ##virus , the conference has been cancelled . Not surprised by that , but by the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago and their treatment of their customers . They will not be re ##fu ##nding our money or even allowing us to go at a later time . They offered a slap in the face of 10 , 000 points to make it up to us , which as many of us know will not even get me a hotel room for the night . I found out after talking to a representative there , other H ##ya ##tt ' s have treated their customers differently . The Chicago H ##ya ##tt has decided this is their course of action . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room for the price . Great location and friendly staff . Bath ##rooms could be updated but rooms were good and the beds were nice . There were many restaurants and bars within walking distance . I would recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal is in a great location right by the river and the Du ##S ##able Bridge , and close to the Loop . My room was on the small side but clean and well cared , with up - to - date furnishings and comfortable bed linen ##s . All of the staff I interact ##ed with were warm , friendly , and helpful . Even if you don ' t want to swim , go up and at least take a look at the historic pool from the hotel ' s previous life as the Medina ##h Athletic Club at the end of the R ##oar ##ing 20 ' s . I also asked a con ##cier ##ge if he would allow me to sneak a peek at the King Arthur Court banquet room ( formerly a smoking lounge ) , and he was kind enough to show it to me . Would love to stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very happy with our room & the whole K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker experience . The staff was friendly which made us feel welcome in Chicago , also excellent with directions and guidance . We highly recommend the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a pleasant surprise . The Suite ##s were very comfortable and with some diet restrictions the kitchen with full cooking and re ##f ##rig ##eration was a must . The Social Hour and Breakfast services were also a nice plus . An unknown benefit was the location ' s proximity to the Red Line . This was helpful [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is totally first class with an atmosphere and charm of old Hollywood . The location is great for shop ##pers and those who want to visit the Chicago Art Institute or the theatre district . My room was clean , quiet and comfortable . T ##rea ##t yourself well and stay at the Palmer House . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ##t beat the location B ##UT - One small elevator that requires a 15 - 20 wait . The other has been broken for 3 m because there is no money to fix it . - Food is very fair - ch ##ew ##y eggs , weak coffee - the parent company is at risk of brand damage ; there are plenty of options : The Thompson being one of them [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent room , service , and location to visit Chicago by foot . French sa ##vo ##ir fair ##e but also local knowledge and great recommendations for walks . Excellent con ##cier ##ge service for booking ##s , delayed parcel ##s , flights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for almost a week , and everything was very fine . Good sized room with very good beds . Little things like compliment ##ary water bottles and newspapers on the door no ##b every morning made us feel at home . That said , Chicago water is good , so tap water is ok , but on arrival at a new destination , we don ' t know that . The best surprise was the excellent restaurant . Apart from that , very friendly and helpful s ##tag [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed my recent stay . Love the Fair ##mont Hotel . A classic hotel with modern amenities . The location is central to many attractions . Easy walking to Millennium Park , shopping , museums , stadium , and the lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff is top notch - especially on the Fair ##mont Gold Floor ( 15th ) The con ##cier ##ge and staff in the Fair ##mont Gold Lounge were superb , as was the continental breakfast we enjoyed . Great location and great views of the parks and lake - from our room and the lounge . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My partner and I came to town for a concert ( Queen ) . We picked The H ##ya ##tt by chance . We ’ re so happy we did . It was top notch service th ##ru out are stay . All the employees were willing to help us . We ate at the cafe style restaurant in the lower lobby . The food was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the hotel for a week . We really enjoyed our stay . Staff are very friendly and helpful . You get snack ##s for breakfast and a free drink and snack ##s in the evening . It is also the perfect location from the magnificent mile . We will definitely stay here when we go to Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Were were downtown to take a few tours with the Chicago Arch ##ite ##cu ##al Center . This hotel is basically right across the river . The rooms & views were great . We were luck enough to come on a slow night and received complementary upgrades to higher floor rooms . they have done a great job re ##mo ##del ##ing the hotel and and furnished it with comfortable beds and accessories . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super location Friendly and helpful staff . Clean and followed Co ##vid pro ##to ##cal ##ls well . Well within walking distance of downtown Chicago . We had a great room that looked north over the Chicago river and the Michigan Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You will never do better than S ##O ##FI ##TE ##L for travel a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s ! ! ! The fine personnel there treat you as a G ##UE ##ST , that you truly are ! From the Bell Captain on through until Check Out , the treatment is always friendly , professional , efficient , and very welcoming ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed my 5 night stay in the royal suite at the Conrad Chicago this last week . I ’ m looking forward to returning to Chicago and definitely staying at the Conrad again . He view was beautiful , and the staff was quite helpful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve stayed multiple times and each has been a good experience . This is not the most luxurious hotel , but it is comfortable , clean and well appointed . And you can ' t beat the view of the Tribune tower while you ' re drinking your morning coffee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent the night there after going out to dinner for anniversary . Has amazing view of the city . There is an on ##site bar and restaurant but we chose to eat elsewhere . Check in was smooth and easy . There is v ##alet parking . As with anything in the city of Chicago this isn ' t a cheap hotel and if you want breakfast it ' s separate but worth it . The bed is extremely comfortable as well as the bed ##ding and you can order them for home if you like . The staff is extremely helpful and pleasant . Would recommend giving the hotel a try it ' s the only place we stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I got a good deal so i booked this hotel and i was pretty impressed from the location and the service I got . Normally i don ' t have to pay extra to get 2 beds but this time they charged me for it which is just fine . The room is a good size , the bed is pretty amazing . It ' s like sleeping in the clouds . The bathroom is very clean . I actually stepped on the shower bare ##foot ##ed which I normally don ' t . They have a self ##ie ready lights a ##cc ##g ##d to my brother . It complement ##s your complex ##ion . My only complain is why the free coffee and c ##rois ##san ##t is only till 7 ##pm ? But i will stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed here before and each time has been good . We were greeted with smiles even before we entered the hotel . We got there early and our rooms were ready . If you are a Ka ##rma member you will get a free drink up to $ 10 during your stay . The rooms are nice . You do have to ask for a coffee maker to be in the room . That was there within minutes of my request . Lemon water available all day . Coffee and tea in the morning . A very nice free wine reception from 5 - 6 daily . Location is great ! Excellent bloody Mary at South ##water Kitchen attached to the hotel . They are a pet friendly hotel . We didn ' t have one with us and never had any issues with any other pets . Will definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice place , great location , room was nice some dust on vent ##s and lamps . There is NO pool , this is the one of the main reasons we selected this hotel . They say they have one on many travel sites but do not and you have to pay for W ##i ##F ##i . Those are the reasons for the 3 star not 5 . If you have kids that want to swim do not select this hotel . View from 29th floor was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My first room had a small issue so the staff kindly took care of it and moved me to a room with a beautiful view of the river . Any questions or problems I had were quickly handled by the staff . The two bars were great places to have drinks or a meal at the end of the evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very nice and clean . Location is perfect . Close to shops , restaurants , pier . . . Staff was great , very helpful . Was very happy that they are very pet friendly . High ##ly recommend it , will definitely go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal for the second time recently . We were there for the first time in August for a short stay and immediately after returning home we booked a December trip to check out Chicago at Christmas . We love the hotel . It ’ s location is perfect for summer or winter . It ’ s very close to the river walk , tour boats , Navy Pier and Millennium Park , all great summer attractions . It ’ s directly on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , great for Christmas lights , decorations and , of course , shopping & restaurants . Both rooms we had were excellent , spacious with comfortable beds . Service is outstanding all the way around , from check - in to room attendant ##s , bell ##men , bartender ##s and food and service in the restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On the whole helpful staff at this hotel , very convenient for all the major attractions of Chicago . Room Service was disappointing , twice our rooms weren ' t made up and we had to speak to the reception desk who sorted it out [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was impress very nice staff clean hotel great breakfast and great location will stay again and recommend to families and friends and co - workers . Very close to nice restaurant navy pier and magnificent mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Right downtown by Navy Pier and Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . a great lo ##ca ##ion to get anywhere in Chicago . Staff was very friendly and rooms were comfortable and clean . E ##v ##fer ##yt ##hing w ##sa great and I would definitely stay here a ##gai ##m . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great bout ##ique hotel ! Very nice updated modern rooms . Great service with friendly at ##ten ##tive staff . Only complaint - bed was a little stiff ##er than I prefer but overall still would highly recommend the Talbot ##t ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s just not worth the money . I know I ' ve got to spin this review out to 200 characters but the reality is you just can ' t justify their price for what you get either service or room quality - wise . We were locked out after op ##ting for a late check out , had no turn - down service & ran out of toilet paper . Just don ' t bother . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We finally got a chance to get away for the weekend and chose this location in the heart of Chicago . We were able to get where ever we needed to in a short amount of time . We also were able to interact with several employees of the hotel who went above and beyond with being helpful and inform ##ative . The rooms were clean and quiet and I appreciated that once we checked in , no one from the hotel was in the room . If we needed anything , we called and it arrived quickly , such as towels . I would definitely stay at this hotel again and again because of the people mostly , but also the location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My friend and I only stayed one night , but it was great . All hotel staff that we encountered were wonderful . The room was clean with comfortable beds . There was no noise at all in the hallway ##s . Make sure to scan your room key before trying to operate the elevator ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed the location as it was easily accessible to theatre district , restaurants , shopping , museums and the lake for the airs ##how . Stay ##ed here for six nights for business / pleasure . Room ##s are large suites with separate bedroom which is very nice . Only problem was the worst ever internet access . Despite calling three times to their technical help ##d desk , finally gave us and used the w ##if ##i at the conference centre . Staff were very nice , friendly . House ##keeping staff very good - place promptly kept clean and if I was around , always asked if I needed anything . Good service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I met the most amazing person at this hotel , Annie Price , who was cleaning rooms on the 22nd floor and greeted me so warmly , learned my name , and was so amazing ##ly kind and caring . She deserves all the praise in the world . And all the staff I encountered were fantastic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean professional court ##eous at ##ten ##tive re ##sp ##ons ##ive caring always a smile Restaurant creative excellent presentation very ta ##sty a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tive relaxed innovative only one year old Close to the stores but minimize walk in traffic Price is very competitive and fair [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very Hotel . Not thrilled with the re ##mo ##del ##ing of the rooms . Climate control in the room was very inconsistent . Great location . It is very close to many restaurants , shops , etc . The service was very good . However , the noise from hallway ##s and other rooms can be easily heard . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The gold floor staff were great but I think the rest of the staff missed the " put the paying customer first " presentation . Been to 22 Fair ##mont ##s and this one was very disappointing . Close to Mill ##eni ##um park and Miracle mile [SEP]
1	[CLS] I only stayed at the Monaco for a night , but would definitely stay here again . The king room I stayed in , which I think is one of their base rooms , was gorgeous , modern , and clean . The furnishings were some of the most beautiful I have seen in a hotel . It was a decent size room , but the window was super small . Not sure if all the base rooms are like that , but it wasn ’ t a deal break ##er for us , especially for one night . Also , try and get a higher floor . We were on 4 , and could hear a lot going on down on the street below . This place is walk ##able to everything , would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Better than Brand experience . A V ##ER ##Y generous Manager ##s reception , a very nice continental breakfast set out on EA ##CH floor . An absolutely perfect location . Seems like we were less than 2 blocks from anything we wanted to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador is a hidden G ##em near the Lakes ##hore . Within walking distance to many restaurants . Downtown location close to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and Hop on Hop off stop . Close to John Hancock Tower . No U ##ber needed if you ’ re into walking ! Beautiful location ! Clean ! Friendly Staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We live in the suburb of Chicago . This was nice get away . Nice and quiet . The staff was welcoming . Location was perfect . Restaurant and mall ##s . Walking distance . A plus . Thank you Intercontinental . . . There are no words to describe . We love Michigan Ave . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great and we have stayed previously . Level of service has declined over time though , and we probably won ' t stay again , which is disappointing because we prefer Home ##wood Suite ##s . Staff is not especially interested in customer service and house ##keeping is V ##ER ##Y unreliable . Air conditioning in room barely worked . The stay is too expensive for a sub ##par experience . Guest ##s should not have to na ##g for basic , quality service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved this hotel . Location is great , spot ##lessly clean rooms , the bed is incredible . It seems the great places have just that little extra touch and with this place they had all of that , including great service . Not one encounter was just so - so , they were all above expectations , from a staff member assisting with an elevator without our asking , to check in and out ( and a subsequent call in for a question ) to the restaurant and bar staff . They exceeded our expectations and we will definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay at So ##fit ##el . High end amenities in hotel , friendly staff , awesome location . Everything was super clean . El ##eva ##tors were fast . Restaurant and Bar excellent . We have stayed in 6 different hotels in downtown Chicago , and this was the best . We will stay there again on our next Chicago visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff very helpful and friendly . Good location , lovely rooms and rooftop bar . Breakfast could be improved with availability of bread and toast , coffee could be stronger and food at dinner could have been a lot better [SEP]
1	[CLS] The best part was the location . Right between the magnificent mile and millennium park area . Once you walk out you see the Trump tower to your right . We didn ' t have much of a view , just the brick building of m ##ort ##ons steak ##house but the r ##ook itself was nice . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . The reception ##ists were nice , with an exception to this once lady with very short hair who had a bit of an attitude about my charges when we checked out but overall the others were nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Inter ##continent ##ial Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile Chicago was a great hotel . All the staff we interact ##ed with were friendly and extremely helpful without being in ##tr ##usive . The room was lovely , spacious , and very comfortable . The amenities were perfect and the location very convenient for everything we wanted to do in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What can I say ? From the time we arrived we were welcomed with cheerful greeting ##s and helpful tips , especially from Perry and Timothy ! Room was beautiful , location perfect for exploring the city . Best hotel we have stayed at in years ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel because they offer a indoor pool . However the water was really cold , to the point we almost couldn ’ t swim . . . also not to happy about getting charged for internet which was supposed to be completely free due to my status with Ex ##ped ##ia . And the they charged us for drinks , when we brought our own water . They did reverse the charges , but I had to call twice . On the other hand it is a Great location , and the rooms were decent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This central downtown hotel has been recently renovated . Stay ##ed a week for a meeting in a 2 x queen suite , which was very spacious . Free b ##uff ##et breakfast was very good . There is an evening reception from 5 pm to 7 pm with food , Monday to Thursday . Free w ##if ##i was good . Heat ##ed pool on top floor was clean . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It had been 11 years since our last visit . A few changes were that there was no longer a con ##cier ##ge . We loved Sylvia on our last visit , but I understand the need for change when running a business . Also , we didn ' t have a turn down service in the evening . Despite these two changes , we still love the Hotel Monaco Chicago . It is in a great location with many good restaurants nearby . We loved the compliment ##ary wine hour and the coffee / tea in the morning . The staff is always very welcoming and ready to help in any way . The house ##keeping staff was also amazing . One last thing to mention is that the beds were very comfortable . Hotel Monaco is always our first choice when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 2 nights at the Monaco with our two kids , ages 6 and 8 . The location of the hotel is perfect for visiting the city . It is close to the loop / business district but also just steps from Michigan Ave , Mill ##en ##num Park , and River North . The hotel is very nice but also kid friendly . Our kids got a cute gift bag at check in and the hotel placed a small fish tank with a gold ##fish in our room for the weekend which our kids loved . The hotel has deep window si ##lls that the kids could sit on and watch the traffic and boats on the river . We didn ' t spend much time in the hotel but the beds and shower were nice . The two main double deck ##er bus companies stop right on the other side of W ##ack ##er , which was very con ##vin ##ient for our weekend tourist ##y activities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just can ’ t beat the location and comfort of the O ##m ##ni Chicago . The rooms are beautiful and functional . Stay ##ed on the 18th floor in a corner suite , and I honestly have no idea if anyone else was on the same floor . It was so quiet inside . But once you stepped outside , all the sites and sounds of Chicago ’ s Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile were all around you . Had so much fun and the room rate was great ! Great job , O ##m ##ni Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a weekend get ##away , using Travel ##zo ##o promotion that included parking and breakfast . We had stayed with same pro ##mo last year . Hotel has great location , very comfortable rooms , very nice restaurant bar and good , efficient service . High ##ly recommend for anyone looking for a weekend in the city . Conrad delivered on all counts - [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was great , the bed was com ##fy , better than ours at home . Bell ##man Craig was helpful and funny . He made us feel safe and at home , like a member of the family . Love ##d the work - out room . The cocktail lounge was a great place to meet our family . Also , having heard about rain shower ##s , this was my first time actually using one . What a luxury , at a budget price ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great welcome by the reception staff including Rosa ##nna and also Perry - they were so friendly . The rooms have all kinds of g ##ad ##gets including lamps with us ##b charge ##rs , electronic do not disturb signs and clock radios with Blue ##tooth . The 20 ##E restaurant and bar serves delicious food and cocktail ##s . It is really close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile too . But the most important thing was the helpful ##ness of the staff . All the staff . Love ##d Chicago and would definitely come back to this hotel . Thank you all . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the So ##fit ##el Chicago for our mini - honeymoon get ##away earlier this month . Our stay was wonderful ! The room was lovely with beautiful views and the staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to many nice restaurants and shopping areas . I especially appreciated the free coffee and c ##rois ##san ##ts every morning : - ) We would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very disappointed by this hotel . It needs renovation as the rooms and infrastructure ##s are dated . I had no bathroom robe or slip ##pers in my room . . . I would expect a 4 star hotel to at least provide those . Not worth the rate [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at this hotel for this first time and it was a great experience . The hotel is very well located , staff were friendly and professional , and the rooms are spacious and modern . The overall value is high when you include the compliment ##ary breakfast and evening social . My only real complaint is the cable service which did not always have good reception . It would have been great to access streaming services from the TV like more hotels are doing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##hrill ##ed with the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Nice room , decent fitness center , easy to use business center , and continental breakfast included . Only down ##side would be the view from the room if that is important but they have very good black ##out sliding shades which makes the view easy to forget . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over ##p ##rice ##d . Room didn ’ t have a refrigerator or microwave . Couldn ’ t heat my food up or keep it overnight ! Staff told me it would be a $ 45 charge to for me to “ rent ” a microwave . In ##san ##e ! $ 285 for a room and parking . Nothing special ! Next time I will stay at the holiday inn or Congress hotel downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] But only average front desk staff . Good social hour snack ##s . Poor breakfast b ##uff ##et Great bell staff service Love ##ly quiet room Nearby shopping and restaurants were very good . Nice kitchen in room if you need it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Far ##imo ##nt Gold staff and lounge experience was outstanding , hotel well located , clean and welcoming , if a bit dated in some of the de ##cor . Very much appreciated the quick check - in and check - out and really very friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great area of the city , very central with easy access to sights , restaurants and shops rooms are comfortable and once the elevator issue is resolved it will be perfect . I would definitely come back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just back from a night at the Chicago Boat Show and an evening at the Talbot ##t . The small hotel is just te ##rri ##fic . The re ##mo ##del ##ed rooms and public spaces are fresh and nicely done . The staff is at ##ten ##tive , warm and friendly . The bar is delight ##ful and the drinks are a good pour . My advice is to book here now ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Palmer House hotel in Chicago for Crime ##C ##on crowd solve . Beautiful historic hotel . Conference rooms were good . Nice room . The restaurant in the hotel had great service and food . Excellent location for restaurants and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had wonderful trip to Chicago and stayed at a great hotel . Perfect location , friendly staff , gorgeous room and excellent food and beverage . I will definitely bring my husband back to stay here for a long weekend . Everything was close by , the river , the architecture , restaurants and the shops . You can walk everywhere from here . There were fireworks over the lake one night which was magical . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff very professional and welcoming . Nice welcome package from the events manager ( 2 bottles of Fiji water , nuts , chocolate ##s . . . ) in my room as we had a small meeting taking place . Very good location for this She ##rato ##n Grand , close to the lake and a few minutes away from Michigan Avenue ( big shopping street ) . The G ##ym equipment was okay and not too busy . I had access to the Executive lounge where I ate breakfast . It ’ s not extra ##va ##gant but certainly does the trick . A detail , but although I was on the 31st floor , I found the lifts very efficient with little or no waiting time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Re ##ceived the worst customer service while trying to resolve a bill ##ing issue after my stay . Left multiple messages for accounting and management that were not returned . Des ##k staff simply said they " had no record " of an almost $ 200 charge to my credit card . Need ##less to say we will be staying elsewhere on our next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is pretty nice but it is overs ##had ##owed by the high price of parking . The parking is $ 50 a night , which is very price ##y for most budget ##s . If You plan on coming to Chicago and need to park a car , choose a hotel that offers better parking options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our wedding party stayed at the hotel and the staff went out of their way to accommodate all of our requests . They were very flexible about our use of space for a breakfast area and were just wonderful all around . The rooms were beautiful and very clean . A shout out to Leah R and all of the other front desk staff . Also Shay , your accountant was most helpful too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While the hotel was nice and located convenient ##ly in the center of the city . However , our overall stay was not pleasant due to the loud elevator noise making it hard to have a good night sleep . It could have been appreciated if we were warned ahead of time about the location of our room being close to the elevator . We requested another room but was told none was available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice staff in general . Modern , clean rooms and bathroom ##s . Double sinks in the bathroom ##s are awesome ! Quiet , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting hotel . Glad we tried it . Nice restaurant and fitness area . Close to many great restaurants and department stores . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is class all the way . Great staff and elegant room will have you wanting to stay an extra night . Super close the Ma ##g Mile other Chicago highlights . A bit on the spend ##y side but this hotel is a great example of getting what you pay for ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very warm and welcoming staff . The food was amazing and staff was available throughout the entire event to make sure all of our needs were met . We returned a second time this year since we were very pleased with last year ' s event as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment we set foot in the H ##ya ##tt Regency Hotel Chicago , to the last day of our conference we felt like royalty . We loved the food , their breakfast service and the on premise restaurant , they were both staffed by wonderful folks . The rooms and the service we got at the hotel , was first class . Their conference rooms were adequately equipped and the place was incredibly clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was a step away from the tour bus and the River tour . Right on the water and in the middle of all points of interest for downtown . Quite impressed . I would have like free breakfast , and unsure what the parking situation is like , so may be a concern . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful views from the rooms at this hotel . I ' ve been coming here for over 20 years and they have gone through many changes , but all good ! Peace ##ful environment . The breakfast b ##uff ##et is nice - has a good variety ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice place in many ways , including helpful staff , good service and location . Conference rooms for meeting were kept at a good temperature and had good ##A / V . My major concern was very uncomfortable mattress and room with fewer amenities than I expected . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am actually currently staying at the hotel . I have stayed here many times before . While not the best location it is acceptable . It is definitely a business hotel . So while it has never been up to the Fair ##mont Resort properties , It is a popular selection for conferences . Unfortunately the hotel has gone down in quality over the years . Just checked into corner room with amazing view but , the pictures I am posting will give you an idea about how clean it is . The shower was full of mold . When I took a wash cloth to the spots with little effort the mold came off . See picture of mold on wash ##cloth . . . this was just one spot . . . there were too many to count . house keeping is not at all up to Fair ##mount standards . I recommend finding another hotel and forget this place [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very happy when I arrived at P ##U ##BL ##IC after one crazy flight from Seattle . Clean room , nice lobby / entrance area , good service , w ##if ##i that worked and fair price - will be back at Public next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel is spectacular . The river view and the proximity to the magnificent mile can ’ t be beat . The rooms were clean and spacious . The staff was warm and knowledge ##able . Great place to stay in Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is central ##ly located with great walking access to touring Chicago main sights with great walking access to the area ' s key shopping and tourist attractions . A G ##RE ##AT return for your money ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really spacious room and stunning view . Very convenient location with underground walkway connected to H ##ya ##tt with a lot of fast food options along the way . Unfortunately the TV signal was spot ##ty which had unreliable channel service during the stay . But definitely will stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our visited started off bad with the check in personnel . However , he red ##ee ##med himself and gave me our discount . He also followed up with a phone call and amenities in our room . The She ##rato ##n personnel are very nice and house ##keeping does an excellent job . Our room was spacious , quiet and very clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one night for our annual trip to see A Christmas Carol at the Goodman . Within walking distance to all the theaters . Hotel is very clean and a beautiful lobby area . En ##joy ##ed the happy hour with hot b ##our ##bon s ##pice ##d c ##ider ! Room was small but bed was super com ##fy and bathroom had all updated fixtures . Show ##er pressure was awesome ! Will definitely be recommend ##ing this hotel to family and friends . Thanks again Kim ##pton for another fantastic stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this property for three nights . We have stayed at Fair ##mont Hotels before and loved them . This hotel room is not decorated very nice and definitely not the high quality I would expect . The noise in the room was annoying . We weren ’ t by the elevators but yet we could hear them running all night long . At one point I heard the room above us p ##ee ##ing and flush ##ing the toilet . No thanks I will go someone else next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed as a last minute switch . Hotel is clean and in a lovely neighborhood . Kay was amazing ##ly helpful with any request or suggestions of dinner choices . All the staff was friendly and welcoming . De ##fin ##ite ##ly returning in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was the second hotel that we stayed my friends and me in Chicago , we decided this hotel for the architecture , luxury rooms , good location . we really loved this place , you have everything nearby . We recommend it 100 % . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed the day before New Year ' s , so the hotel was very busy . . We were helped at check in by an awesome man named Hugo . Although we were early and our room wasn ' t quite ready , Hugo said he would contact us just as soon as he could get things in order . . . Within 20 - 30 min , he called to say we could pick up our room keys ! Such a kind and pleasant man . . he went above and beyond to get us situated . . We enjoyed our room , which had an awesome view of the river and f ##er ##ris wheel on the lake . We had access to the Club Lounge which provided great snack ##s and beverages . Beer and wine could be purchased , but everything else was included . Thank you to the staff in the Lounge , who kept everything re ##ple ##nish ##ed and were friendly to all guests ! We will return soon . . : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was surprised on how B ##IG the room was when we walked in . It was also very well decorated . Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tor was well stacked with snack ##s and drinks . Extra ##s were also there if needed . If you can think of it , it was probably readily available . The bed was very com ##fy as well . Hope I need to stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Talbot ##t is a cute bout ##ique hotel in a great area . The staff is wonderful and ensured we had all of the accommodation ##s necessary to enjoy our stay . D ##wayne in particular was phenomena ##l in ensuring we had a blast . Will visit again soon . Thanks ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location : perfect Service : perfect Bed ##s : king size too soft and sofa bed not comfortable ( sorry but it was awful ) Breakfast : w ##ow ! ! ! ! Super good Staff : super friendly Room ##s : great views , complete and e ##qui ##ped kitchen , king size bed , black - out windows , dining table , modern , great ! ! Pool : warm and with a 19th floor view ! Would definitely stay there again ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el was the perfect place to spend a weekend away with my husband . Service was excellent and the junior sweet was clean and comfortable . It was next to all the shops and restaurants so we were able to walk to everything ! I would highly recommend the So ##fit ##el ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First class hotel that delivered on its name . The views of downtown Chicago were breath ##taking . Service was amazing as we utilized all amenities from bar , restaurant , and con ##cier ##ge . Can ##not under ##state how pleased we were with our decision to make the Conrad our home and HQ while we were in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My Hu ##sband and I stayed at Talbot ##t ' s for my Birthday ! ! The service was a 10 + with recommendations where to go , and they set up reservations at a excellent steak house to celebrate ! ! The room was co ##zy and the beds where so comfortable ! Love all the old d ##é ##cor and elevators ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was thrilled with everything about this hotel ; the room , the price , the location , every member of the staff . The desk agent went out of her way to make sure we knew when our room was ready , since we arrived much earlier than planned . The suite environment was perfect for our sleeping arrangements , and they even provided a wonderful pad for the pull out couch to make sure we were comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We held our daughter ' s wedding reception in the Intercontinental Grand Ball ##room in January , 2020 . Approximately 288 guests . We also had over 80 hotel rooms in the room block for the weekend . Our guests were very compliment ##ary on the entire weekend . The Michigan Avenue location was convenient and perfect for out of town guests who wanted to site see . Tara Hubbard did a f ##abulous job from our first meeting to discuss a potential wedding venue , then the contract details , tasting and menu selection , final walk through , to the actual event date . I can ' t praise her enough ! If you are considering a wedding in downtown Chicago and want it run right , give them a call ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here with part of a group for a event held at the hotel . The event in the ballroom was beautiful . Our room was on a corner with 3 windows . Spa ##cious with great views . Bath ##room was really nice , especially travelling with family we needed the extra room . Maid service was excellent . Bell boys were also excellent and quick . Everything was top notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel recently . We found it to be a very clean , very comfortable stay . The staff were very helpful , the bathroom ##s looked like they were recently red ##one . The price was very reasonable . It is walking distance from everything — we would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a first rate hotel . I was especially impressed with the friendly staff . From v ##alet to bell ##man to front desk to restaurant . I would greatly recommend this hotel for families . The location is perfect to view the many cultural assets of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Strategic ##ally located on the river front . great view from the room itself of the lake . our room was very spacious and clean . Walk along side the river on a walking distance was very peaceful . Even the boat for river and lake cruise is available at a walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , awesome staff and amenities . . . evening light dinner / happy hour ( M - T ##h ) is a great per ##k ! Room ##s have beautiful views of the city . Hotel is central ##ly located so it is within walking distance of all shopping and theatres . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The entry is somewhat under ##w ##hel ##ming but the suites are great especially on the 19th ( top ) floor with spectacular views . Breakfast is extremely crowded on the weekend if you are not there early . Limited variety at breakfast during the week . Staff are very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel location right in the heart of Chicago . Friendly hotel staff . The beds a super comfortable . No room service is offered , however there are so many food establishments to choose from just a stone throw away . High ##ly recommend this place if you are in Chicago . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a couple of days here while over for work meetings , A really nice hotel with very friendly staff . The main man Craig at the con ##cier ##ge did a super job . Super friendly and great fun and very very helpful . A delight to deal with and bright ##ened up my day no end . . . The location of this hotel to the beach and all the shopping is super . . . really cool place . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Looking forward to our next visit . From the v ##alet ( sorry but I didn ' t catch his name ) who was so nice to our 8 - year - old son that my son got him a dough ##nut at Stan ' s , to Francesca from in - room dining , the staff was very friendly , at ##ten ##tive and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean , our room was quiet and well appointed . The only complaint would be the paper cups with the coffee machine . Nice to have a Ku ##eri ##g machine though . Nice big bed with crisp sheets . Breakfast was very good , service was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was com ##fy , beds were so soft . Walking distance to event near the lake . We had a view of the lake . We had two bath rooms ( which we were not expecting ) . Made getting ready very easy . Staff was friendly . It was perfect . Would definitely stay again with my husband . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This would be a nice hotel if it were 3 stars , but rating it as a four star hotel is un ##real ##istic . Our room was had mold on growing on ceiling . The walls were banged up . It ’ s definitely in need of some repairs . The location is f ##abulous . The staff were kind and court ##eous . However there wasn ’ t enough staff . With only one staff member , there was a long wait to check in on a Monday afternoon . The wait to get my car was even longer the next day , at least 20 minutes . Over $ 70 a day to park and with such a long wait , we should have just parked it ourselves . The city view should be called a street view , as the building is so much lower than the others you don ’ t see much except for the street below and 1 - 2 buildings . It ’ s not a bad place , just not a great place either . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is my first stay at this hotel . I was impressed with the location , atmosphere , room , and view . The staff were friendly and at ##ten ##tive . I will definitely come back here for my next trip to Chicago . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was a decent room but was not cleaned daily . The house ##keeping staff only made the beds They did not empty trash cans remove dirty towels from the previous day . The front desk person was overwhelmed by the number of people checking in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel and amenities but very small and dated rooms . For around $ 300 after tax , I expected something a lot nice ##r and bigger . I did however really appreciate the refrigerator in the room . We stayed on the 24th floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hospitality starts when you approach the door when the bell ##man opens the door for you and asks if you need any help with your luggage . Then you enter a very se ##rene and calm lobby with high ceilings painted in dark h ##ues . The walls are very light but the feeling is to slow down from the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le of the busy and noisy Chicago streets . The sound of a bar ##ista f ##roth ##ing milk is suddenly heard and the wait staff is eager to point you in the direction of the check in counter . You feel like you are in an ups ##cale , very European hotel with all of the amenities you could possibly desire . The rooms were avant guard and comfortable . The bathroom amenities were Her ##mes . They served lo ##bs ##ter rolls in the restaurant downstairs and the lounge served generous pour ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the quality of room , bathroom , restaurant and staff and house keeping f and food was not there . when you are spending money to be on their gold floor and you can get co ##ke and s ##p ##rite and some juice as your a ##cco ##m ##dation ##s that isn ##t what it used to be . at other properties it is an upgraded experience in service and what is available before Fair ##mont was bought this property was much better in every regard [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister and niece ##s stayed in one of the suites the night we went to the Taylor Swift concert . The suite was perfect - great views and the beds so ##oo ##oo comfortable . Room service the next morning was also wonderful . The service was great and extra k ##udo ##s to the manager - Cody . My sister and her family have already booked their next Chicago stay in August at the Fair ##mont in a suite . Next time I am in Chicago overnight , I ’ ll definitely stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I just stayed two nights at the Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago and had a very comfortable stay in the this well - situated hotel . As it turned out , a business partner had made my room reservation for me through Ex ##ped ##ia , but did it as two separate one - night reservations ( which meant that I might have had to switch rooms for the second day ) . Nicole , one of the amazing front desk ambassador ##s , immediately recognized the problem with this and quickly - - and with a lovely disposition - - re ##set the reservation and exceeded my expectations by placing me in a desirable corner room with great views . She didn ' t need to do this , but she ' s a pro and made me feel super welcome . I ' m very happy to celebrate her te ##rri ##fic service and value to the team ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our time at the Ki ##nz ##ie . The compliment ##ary happy hour was a nice way to meet fellow guests . The River North location was very good and a nice way to see part of the city we had not spent much time in before . The local restaurants were all very good and the area made it easy to get around to the main sights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ized location in walking distant to shopping , restaurants , and points of interest . Staff are friendly , professional , and always ready to cater to you . Management is top notch . Room ##s are si ##mp ##listic el ##egan ##ce and don ' t forget to take a dip in their famous pool . De ##fin ##ite ##ly coming back with the family next time . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay was very pleasant , the staff was helpful and polite , my room was clean and comfortable . The hotel is located close to f ##abulous restaurants that are within walking distance . I recommend this hotel for anyone visiting this area of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good enough for a business trip . Room was spacious with separate dressing area . Sep ##arate bath and shower which isn ' t always the case . Equipment is packed into the basement gym ( no natural light ) which made it feel crowded and was very busy in the early morning , with lots of t ##read ##mill ##s , cross trainers , free weights , but only a few weight machines . Have been into many better gym ##s in similar standard hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very nice . Room ##s were clean and nicely appointed . Staff were friendly and helpful . The breakfast and evening reception were Fantastic . A wonderful stay . Pool was also nice . The rooms are suites which include a kitchen with fridge and stove with a m ##oc ##row ##ave and dish ##wash ##er . Room ##s are large and very ##u comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice are and outside . Door staff , parking nice . Lo ##bby de ##cor , nice . However , rooms are 2 . 5 star , small beds , no top / flat sheets , never gave after request . Also , bathroom and behind door had p ##eel ##ing paint and Ra ##dia ##tor , yes r ##adia ##tor knocked & t ##icked when coming on . Fe ##lt more like visiting a basic home , not 4 star hotel at all . If priced lower , then reserve , but not ups ##cale at A ##ol [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great girl ' s weekend at this hotel ! ! The window seat overlooking the river was amazing . . . at night it was so beautiful . The room was nice and there was a great wine hour each evening . Location was good , walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go . And we got a gold ##fish in our room to keep us company ! ! A great weekend made better by this great hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here during All Star Weekend visiting friends and family . Ms . Rose Miller was exceptionally pleasant and provided excellent service . The room was very clean after . Will definitely stay here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here at end of October during the hotel strike . It was super expensive as a result , but I enjoyed staying here . Very nice , modern hotel in a great location . Modern furnishings , good size room . Good location near the river and a nice s ##tro ##ll along the river to the lake ( once you get down the 3 flights of stairs from the multi - storey road ) . My room was next to the elevator shaft , so was quite noisy during the night with the w ##hi ##zzi ##ng sound of elevators going up and down . I am a heavy sleep ##er , so it didn ' t affect me too badly , so be careful on your room location if you are a light sleep ##er . Good beds and shower ##s too . Breakfast food was also expensive . Overall , I would recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] happy with my choice . The rooms were smaller than I remembered from about 10 years ago . Very clean . People were very helpful . I would recommend to people who want a fun weekend in Chicago and be able to walk all over the place . Help ##ful and kind staff as well [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great time at the Swedish Covenant Gala in October of 2019 . Everything was great from the reception through the end of our stay . We enjoyed the food , the ballroom , our hotel room was great and so was Kitty O " Shea ##s . I also appreciated the fact that the hotel checked for our room key when we headed to our room by the elevators . I like the extra security for guests . We will definitely stay here again . Great time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very decent , not fancy , rooms clean , but you cannot open the windows , so you depend on the air condition and that ‘ s not always necessary in Chicago , even not in August . Location super central , although no views [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our first time at the O ##m ##ni Chicago hotel and it didn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Love ##d the location , the room was f ##ab and all the staff very helpful , polite and at ##ten ##tive .

1	[CLS] Just spent a long weekend here with our adult children . The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , right from the time we pulled up with our car on Friday evening . From v ##alet to check in , bell service , room service , house ##keeping - - everyone was pleasant and helpful . We were upgraded to a Mediterranean Suite , which has fantastic window seats to sit watch the activity outside . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed ##ding , plenty of outlets for all our electronics , nice fitness center , excellent restaurant , good location , pet friendly . . . It ' s all good here ( for a reasonable price ! ) Ask for a room on a higher floor if city noise is a concern . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was really pretty . Very convenient having restaurants in the hotel . Excellent location . Everything was very clean and felt CO ##VI ##D safe . Room was quiet and the bed was super comfortable . I would stay there again . 10 / 10 recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean , central ##ly located next to restaurants & shopping . Depending on the direction of your window , city views or opposite building ? Restaurant & bar is good . G ##ym is good . East & West towers at this location . Park ##ing is not free . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were spacious and they put us all on the same floor which was te ##rri ##fic . The con ##cier ##ge was friendly , knowledge ##able and very helpful . D ##wayne was the bell ##man and a delight ! ! He was so friendly and helpful and just a joy to us each morning . I used the fitness center which was adequate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is beautiful ! The con ##cier ##ge , bell boys and the clean ##liness are all top notch . The music they play on the street level near the Star ##bu ##cks however needs to be addressed . The volume one morning was so loud I had to cover my ears . It is played at a ridiculous volume , I asked staff to turn it down but was told that it can ##t be done and heard other patrons complain about it to , this is something this hotel needs to fix and cost you 5 stars on my review . The friend ##liness of the staff and clean ##liness of the room and towels was what kept me from giving a 3 star review . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Intercontinental in Chicago for four nights . We had gone for a family wedding , and all the pre - wedding festivities as well as the wedding was held there . Its a beautiful property . It ' s very well located . The staff is very cord ##ial , polite and very helpful . Overall a very pleasant experience . We would love to go back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a quick weekend get away with a few friends and let me just say we were impressed . I would most certainly recommend the Gold Floor as the hospitality was wonderful and all the workers were so persona ##ble . Check in was a breeze and it was quite apparent how all the employees went above and beyond to make sure all guests are well taken care of ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Love being at this Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in downtown Chicago . First off , the staff were kind , efficient , and provided clean service , room , and additional extra toilet ##ry requests . The compliment ##ary cocktail reception ( every night ! ! ) and daily breakfast were also quite fun and helpful . I had a pleasure of also working out a lot during my visit , thanks to the 24 / 7 gym available on my floor . In all , this was a great visit , in a great downtown location . And a V ##ER ##Y Q ##UI ##ET room as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here with my family during the holidays . The weather was beautiful and the hotels location made it perfect for us to walk to ch ##rist ##kind ##lma ##rt and millennium park . The hotel had some nice touches and we enjoyed room service and their cocktail hour . Staff was great and the room was well appointed . We stayed in a suite to give our family of 3 some room to spread out . It was a great vacation ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in town on business and decided to try Fair ##mont Gold - an upgrade that included personal con ##cier ##ge service and exclusive Gold Lounge with city ##sca ##pe and lake views along with complementary food , drinks and honor bar . My “ gold ” guest room was very spacious and the house ##keeping and turn ##down service was extremely pro ##mpt , thorough and kind . Our personal con ##cier ##ge was helpful in providing advice and maps on how to navigate the city efficiently when exploring the city after - hours . I travel 50 % for work , Fair ##mont Gold allowed me a quiet exclusive lounge with an at - home - feel away from home - to work , social ##ize , or just be . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I , along with our two kids came to stay at the Hotel Monaco in downtown Chicago recently . The hotel is perfectly situation along the Chicago River , an easy walk to the Navy Pier , and so many other downtown attractions . The room was spectacular with the little sitting windows . Our kids would wake up each morning and hang out in those no ##ok ##s ! The customer service , from the people at the front desk , to the General Manager Adam G ##urg ##iol ##o were superior . We could not have asked for nice ##r people to interact with at this hotel . We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago if they are looking for outstanding customer service , a luxury property and views to die for ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were nicely re ##mo ##del ##ed . The staff was very nice and helpful . The 67 ##6 Bar & G ##rill breakfast b ##uff ##et was great with wonderful service there as well . We were very happy with our stay and couldn ' t ask for a nice ##r hotel on Michigan Avenue for the money . The location is right in the middle of the shopping action . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is outstanding . The service is helpful , court ##eous , and the best I have encountered . This is the only hotel I will stay in anytime my travels take me to Chicago . The service includes any and all that I encountered - maid ##s , door ##man , bell hop , con ##cier ##ge , check in . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My second time staying here . First time was ok and this time , was one of the worse experiences in recent memory . Room was not clean - bathroom sink had a hair in it , bath ##tub had multiple hairs . To ##ile ##t handle almost fell off . Out ##lets on desk are weird ##ly angled so that not all my devices were charging properly ( depending on shape of adapt ##er ) . S ##nac ##ks in room were un ##hea ##lt ##hy / generic , pretty much ve ##nding machine quality ( honestly have had better from ve ##nding machines ) . Service was hit and miss . Re ##quest ##ed toilet ##ries and it took very long - when I called staff again , could not provide ET ##A and wasn ' t sure what happened . G ##ym is average . Would not recommend unless surrounding hotels all fully booked . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Hotel with European style in the Chicago Downtown area . Room ##s are kept an in modern design . Room ##s are clean and s ##pec ##ious , bathroom with bath tub and shower also kept in a good and clean shape . Staff extremely friendly and supportive . Nice relaxing hotel bar and good food at the restaurant . Just in case , you don ’ t want to leave the hotel , as there are plenty bars and restaurant in the neighborhood . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My parents and I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel the weekend the Chicago Cubs victory occurred . I only have nice things to say about this hotel . The location is convenient but out of the bust ##le . It is located right next to the Trump and Lang ##ham hotels off of the State street bridge . The rooms are spacious , continental breakfast is provided on each floor with a cute wooden tray so one may have breakfast in bed , and the night ##ly Manager ' s reception is more than what you would get at an Embassy Suite ##s . I would definitely stay here again ! I would also go to S ##ling the social pin ##g p ##ong club slash bar . What an interesting concept just a few steps away from the Ki ##nz ##ie . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , very friendly staff , extremely clean and spacious room . We would definitely return to this hotel on our next visit to Chicago . There was a jazz band in the lobby at night which was very fun ! Only negative is v ##alet was expensive for overnight parking but my guess is that would be expensive anywhere in the city [SEP]
1	[CLS] In Chicago for business . Very friendly staff with a very well kept ##s / maintained hotel . The room was on the smaller side but this is downtown Chicago . Overall , good experience and would stay again . The smooth ##ies at breakfast were a great touch ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] For a downtown hotel , the Monaco is a great value . The staff is welcoming and helpful . The rooms are big , well decorated , and well cared for . We didn ' t eat in the restaurant , but it looked nice and seemed to be popular . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is P ##ER ##F ##EC ##T , walking distance to Navy Pier and couple steps to Michigan Avenue . Room is clean , neat and the bed so comfortable . De ##fin ##ite ##ly we will come back again in the future . Thank you for your hospitality . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The best experience I ever had at a hotel in Chicago . I am experiencing a life changing moment and the staff couldn ' t have made me feel anymore special . H ##U ##GE shout out to L ##yn ##sey R ##uck in Cat ##ering and D ##wayne the Bell ##man . They ex ##em ##p ##lify the top tier of what customer service should be about . I am forever thankful for their kindness and warmth to making my stay beyond perfect . The Talbot ##t is extremely lucky to have these two exceptional individuals . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , room ##y and clean , very friendly and helpful staff . The restaurant was good , we had four different app ##eti ##zers that were good and reasonably priced . double sinks in the bathroom and a large room with a large t ##v . Bed and pillows were com ##fy too . Only negative was the location for our event . It ’ s not central ##ly located , although there is a lot of restaurants and shopping in this area . All in all , a great hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over ##rated . Out ##dated . Poor W ##i ##F ##i connection . Air conditioning barely worked . Only a du ##vet on bed . No separate sheet . Web ##site said you get breakfast if you book directly with them but had to argue to get them to honour that - which they barely did . The breakfast itself wasn ' t worth it - sandwiches or limited continental . No compliment ##ary water . Safe was small and placed about 6 feet up on a shelf . Now ##here to put suitcase ##s . Only positive thing was clean ##liness . This place relies on its reputation and looking pretty but doesn ' t deliver of 4 * . Would not recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has everything you would want . The customer service is second to none . The location is perfect . You are within a stones throw to the river . The rooms are clean and very well maintained . An added bonus is the wine happy hour , which was convenient and relaxing . We will return for sure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a great time at the Fair ##mont Millennium Park in Chicago . The Fair ##mont Gold Lounge was awesome with it breath ##taking views and truly wonderful staff like Man ##dan ##a !

Thanks Man ##dan ##a and the entire Fair ##mont Gold team . Dare ##n Hubbard [SEP]

1	[CLS] Love ##d our recent get ##away to Chicago . We were celebrating our 50th birthday ##s in the Wind ##y City and the Intercontinental was the perfect choice for our accommodation ##s . The location is central to absolutely everything and our room was perfect for our needs . Upon our arrival the check ##in was a breeze and we were treated so nicely from the moment we got there . We met the amazing con ##cier ##ge Kathy who took great care in making our trip memorable . Kathy was incredible in her knowledge of Chicago and offered us great suggestions and tips for a wonderful 3 days . Thank you Kathy for helping us make this trip one we will always remember . We will definitely have to come back and we will for sure stay at the Intercontinental ! The entire crew was amazing . [SEP]

There ’ s a trend ##y bar on the lobby level that was busy and full of energy at night . The hotel also has an incredible restaurant - Cafe Des Architect ##es . The fitness center is great . The beds are to die for comfortable . Room size is spacious with large bathroom . We were upgraded to a nice king room on the 25th floor . F ##abulous staff ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great weekend and our stay was wonderful ! Book ##ed a suite for the weekend and the top floor was available and our check in assistant put us in there ! Was great and we felt very special !

1	[CLS] Room was good . Noise from next door was a slight issue . Really like the location . The staff was nice . The bar was too crowded on Saturday night to get drink . They have foam mattress ##es , which some people like , some don ' t ( I ' m in the latter group ) . [SEP]

View of the lake . Staff were professional and helpful . Best breakfast I have had in a hotel for a very long time - didn ' t feel the need to eat for the rest of the day . If you can get a deal including breakfast go for it . Much better than the breakfast ##s in the local del ##is which cost a minimum of $ 25 + for much less . Restaurant staff at breakfast were superb ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently held our annual meeting at this hotel and the people and facilities could not have been better . They accommodate ##d all our last minute changes with grace and ease , and all the amenities and facilities were top - notch . In particular , Randall and Rachel were superb , we could not have asked for better , more pleasant and more at ##ten ##tive help with all of our activities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our 2nd or 3rd stay at All ##egro , and probably 7th - 8th stay at Chicago ' s Kim ##pton properties . They are all unique and we love them all . This was another great stay ! We were on the 17th floor , near the elevator but not too loud in the room . The wine reception at 5 ##pm in the lobby is great , and the staff are warm and friendly . We ' ll be back ! ( We already have another reservation in December ! ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location to explore the city of Chicago . The hotel staff was very friendly and engaged . The con ##cier ##ge desk ##s gave great recommendations and tips for ma ##xi ##mizing our brief stay in the city . The restaurant was beautiful and the food was very ta ##sty , the price was a little expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here in early July . The service was excellent . The room was very clean and comfortable . The only thing that I can think of that the room did not have was a microwave . The refrigerator ##s are available but at the guest request . The customer service was excellent and the con ##cier ##ge was very helpful during my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] our family booked 3 rooms for a holiday weekend . We all had lovely , quiet rooms with a nice view of Navy Pier . The bed was quite comfortable .

Thank you O ##m ##ni to help us celebrate big ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over ##p ##rice ##d for what it is . Staff friendly . Breakfast not included , a joke at this price point . Room fine but nothing special . Hotel refused to register the A ##cco ##r card because I booked through another website . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay . Piano playing in the side bar and lounge when we walked in the door . [UNK] Ke ##wa ##me at check in check out was very helpful and court ##eous .

0	[CLS] Me and my wife stayed here for a few days vacation . We had a pleasant stay and would stay again if we came back . Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful although we didn ' t spend much time at the hotel itself . The room was clean and quiet and the bed was comfortable . The room was smaller than newer hotels but that was to be expected , [SEP]
1	[CLS] We would like to thank Amber ##ouse , Diane , Lucy , Barbara and Guillermo for having been aware of our requirements . From the first day of our stay we didn ' t doubt that it was the best choice we could have done . Not only because of the comfortable facilities but because the staff was excellent . Also , special thanks to Amber ##ouse and Diane for their kindness that they showed us by offering us their absolute availability at all times . This is why our stay in Chicago was really memorable and enjoyable [SEP]

1	[CLS] On a weekend trip to Chicago , we chose to stay at the I ##H ##G hotel . The location was perfect , Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal is right in the center of it all . The service , and the view of the iconic Tribune Tower were among my favorite parts . However , the pool is a must see ; beautiful ! The pool / gym / spa are was very relaxing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfect if you are planning on exploring Chicago . My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay . The rooms were clean , spacious , and I loved the de ##cor . Our room was on the 4th floor which was okay , but I would recommend requesting the 6th floor for a better view . Didn ' t really care for the breakfast but there are plenty of places nearby to get breakfast ( I recommend trying Bee ##f and Brand ##y restaurant , their breakfast is delicious ) . The staff was friendly , court ##eous and cater ##ed to all our needs . I would definitely return here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very friendly and helpful . The room was clean and nice , the bed and pillows were super com ##fy . At least on the higher floors ( I was on 9 ) it was fairly quiet ( normal city noise ) . Good meeting facilities and random sitting areas to get together with friends . The location was perfect for easy walking access to the River ##walk , parks , restaurants , museums , etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have just one thing to say - w ##ow ##w ##w ##w ##w . Right in the heart if Downtown of Chicago this property comes with right prices and amazing facilities . Breakfast and 5 - 7 ##pm dinner are simple great and i never expected so many per ##ks included in the room cost . Very friendly staff , always ready to help and guide you for anything ( routes , arranging taxi ##s and what not ) . Si ##mp ##ly loved every aspect of this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly helpful staff that were always available . Great location and at a great price within walking distance to everything downtown .

I will definitely stay there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] There ' s nothing I didn ' t like about this hotel . In fact is one of my favourite hotels in the U . S . We got a room on the 7th floor overlooking an internal courtyard and it was so quiet I couldn ' t believe I was in the middle of Chicago . I didn ' t hear a single noise the 3 days I was there although a fly would wake me up . The room was very big and clean and so was the bathroom . The bed was huge and super comfortable with a choice of pillows . The reception ##ist and all the staff we encountered were really friendly . The location was really good too and the price un ##beat ##able . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a corner room with windows on three sides . Even the bathroom had full windows so could look out to the river from the bathroom . Super ##b ups ##cale property with wonderful staff . Park ##ing is price ##y . Self parking in Ra ##dis ##son Blue A ##qua will set you back $ 50 for the day . Vale ##t at the hotel will be $ 70 . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had a great stay ! The service was wonderful especially Julius Do ##xy . He was fantastic ! ! ! ! ! ! Wen ##t above and beyond to help my stay great ! ! ! He was so good , I would come again just for his service . Keep up the great work ! [SEP]

0	[CLS] I would return to this hotel if I find myself in Chicago again - gorgeous , clean rooms , great views , and perfect location downtown - staff was court ##eous and helpful . We did have dinner here and as all hotels is price ##y but the service was great and the food ta ##sty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The house ##keeping continued to miss our room for cleaning . After sleeping in the first night , we used the “ make the room ” button to signal for service to the room . However , no one serviced the room upon our return in the evening . After sleeping late the second night , we called the desk for service . Even after the desk agreed to send house ##keeping to the room , no one showed up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at the Conrad but found the service just average compared to prior stays at Conrad Hotels is Asia . Like ##d the 20th floor check in and the staff was friendly . When asked , we explained that we were celebrating a birthday by visiting the city where we had lived for thirty years . Any recognition by staff would have been nice . Our room was modern , functional and had a great view but the H ##VA ##C was difficult to maintain at a steady temperature . Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed tasting Bourbon with the staff at Baptiste and Bo ##ttle . Overall an OK experience but there are too many great hotels in ch ##ica ##go to warrant a return visit here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In addition to having a great location Hotel Monaco has a great staff , two in particular ; Rich the con ##cier ##ge knows Chicago ! Rich can recommend and knows what ever you want in the city . Listen to him ! Michael the Door Man is genuinely concerned about your well ##bei ##ng and getting you where you need to go . Room ##s overlooking river and W ##ack ##er drive are great for people watching . Stay here for the location and just for these guys to take care of you in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was clean and comfortable . They offer a Continental Breakfast and a Happy Hour on the 6th floor . Great to grab a bite and coffee in the morning . The Happy Hour was a little too loud for me , but the fact that they offer it , is nice . I was doing work at The Mart , so the location was convenient . Lo ##ads of restaurants around within walking distance . Staff was very friendly . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is excellent . Staff was superb . Room was lovely . I would recommend staying here . There were 10 us , 5 rooms . Everyone was very satisfied with the place . Great coffee in the morning , room delivery ice ( no noisy machines ) . Very friendly and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came here for a work event over 2 days . The rooms are dated with the bathroom ##s needing quite a bit of up ##dating . There are better options for the price . The conference facilities were fully functioning , but can ’ t get over the rooms . [SEP]
0	[CLS] During a recent H ##ya ##tt Regency stay , I stupid ##ly threw my wallet away with other trash . I reported it not expecting much but not only did they go through the trash to confirm my wallet was gone , they added a credit to my room so I could eat in the hotel AND had their security team assist me with documentation to help me get through security at the airport . I was blown away and so thankful for the stellar service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a wonderful stay at the O ##m ##ni Hotel of Chicago . The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful . It was easily accessible and within walking distance of amazing places to eat and things to see while on our visit . Couldn ' t have asked for a better stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ' t get enough of this hotel at Christmas time . Have stayed a few times and it is extremely comfortable and spot ##lessly clean . I must admit that I found the rooms a bit dull . . . bit be ##ige and b ##lah . . . but I ' d definitely stay again . It ' s convenient to shops and airport [SEP]
1	[CLS] Suite ##s are nice , good kitchen with big fridge . Breakfast is very good : many things to choose from . Even the coffee is okay ! Almost as good as European coffee . In the afternoon there is a welcome drink with food : heal ##ty things like salad ##s , fruit , soup . Taste very good ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a number of issues . . . but the accommodation ##s were nice and the staff were great up on 19 . Did not receive my scheduled wake - up call the first morning . . . was disappointed that there was a charge to use the steam / hot tub at the W ##aldo ##rf and when we went there the hot tub / spa was not working . I felt really overwhelmed with the number of staff " s ##c ##ru ##tin ##izing " guests coming in to the building . . . seems like over ##kill to have 4 - 6 people waiting on you when you come in ? Thought the value for the price including drinks at the bar on 20 . . . perhaps the pricing was in line for Chicago but seemed in ##ord ##inate ##ly high for beer / mixed drinks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the Fair ##mont ! The rooms were spacious and clean , the staff extremely at ##ten ##tive , and the food delicious . The staff was great with our two young kids as well . Location is fantastic . I highly recommend it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Previously stayed at Palmer House for wedding , so husband and I wanted to stay again when we went to visit son . Staff was very g ##rac ##ious and at ##ten ##tive . Just disappointed in upgraded room assignment / size . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff . The bedroom windows had evidently not cleaned in years . Only one waiter was expected to handle a full breakfast room , so service was very slow - but food was OK . Our bathroom door had been evidently installed by someone who had no skill or experience , so it would not close . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a great location . Not sure it was worth $ 350 a night . Average room . The door ##men were always there to help you in and out . I reserved the corner suite thinking it would be larger , but went to other family members room and it was way better . More room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 100 years worth of tradition , and all that goes with it . Not close to the loop , by ##t surprised how much we could hear it . We did [ obviously ] have a back facing room though . . 21st floor and 1 / 4 mile away but still not ##ica ##ble . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here one night for the dental convention at McCormick Place . We had a nice experience . Great location . Our 18th floor room had excellent views , nice size , comfortable bed , large TV . Quick check in , easy check out . Great price . No complaints here ! Overall very satisfied . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love , love , love the hotel location . I stayed here with my daughter for five days . I was there for convention , it was too crowd all the times but is not the hotel fault . Walking distance to the river cruise and river walk are a big plus . I love the view from my room , whether in the day or night time , it was a magnificent view . Stay ##ed at room 251 ##6 to see the view . Bell ##men are helpful and cheerful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is very well maintained with a lot of history . We had a corner room with windows on both sides that let a lot of light in and was so glad we could open them . The room is kinda small but not to bad . I would have liked to have a coffee maker and refrigerator in the room . The fridge in the room was full of for sale items . The staff was pleasant . You have to be patient with the slow elevators . Great location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , very clean , not a fan of the contemporary on a budget look , but still a nice stay for the money . Restaurant , bar , and all employees i interact ##ed with were wonderful . Check in and out was very easy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice spacious room , clean and close to downtown shopping area . Weather was so hot so opted to have dinner and breakfast b ##uff ##et at their 67 ##6 restaurant which has great tasting food . We are just content staying inside the hotel . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Central location and comfortable room . Unfortunately the window was bolted shut and air conditioning was noisy . Other than that , a good breakfast offering and very pleasant , friendly staff . Didn ’ t have time to enjoy the pool unfortunately . . . next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Last min decided to go to the Hilton New Year ’ s Eve b ##ash , it was actually fun . Live music , free drinks , dance floors and party favors . The price was totally worth it for v ##ip ticket . We are going to go next year as well we had so much . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Due to I ##H ##G status , received upgraded room . Service was great as always . There was a buzzing noise in the room and engineering was sent to the room and arrived with minutes . It turned out to be the telephone and the issue was take care of . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d our stay . The room was very comfortable and well appointed , staff were super friendly and court ##eous . Perfect location for getting out and about between conference sessions and enjoying a walk on the river . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sisters celebrating a birthday found this hotel to be perfect . Location was great , staff the best ! An unexpected surprise for an older , updated hotel . Library was great for relaxing with a drink . The bath amenities were outstanding . Very clean a spacious rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were kept waiting an hour and a half beyond the advertised check - in time before we could get into our room . The glass shower door was in desperate need of adjustment . Breakfast food at Am ##use was poor - perhaps on par with McDonald ' s , at best . Having attended 2 or more conferences annually over the past several years , I felt this hotel was one of the most expensive and the value was not there for the money . However , the staff was friendly and helpful plus the hotel is in a good location of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay at Public was even better this year than last year . I appreciated the new management and the improvement in the rooms ( paint , and a carpet upgrade ) . Dinner at The P ##ump Room was first class . We will stay at the hotel often . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very well located . You ca reach Navy Pier and magic mile by walking . Going out at our morning run John the door ##man was greeting as nobody else ! And after a long journey he was there smiling you again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family of five had a great stay here . Everything was no trouble , from our pre - arrival request for two adjoining rooms , to help with jazz club and restaurant recommendations . They even forward ##ed on an item we ' d left in one of the rooms promptly . Food was good and the rooms were spacious . All round great service - probably the best I can remember having - and a lovely hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the So ##fit ##el a few times and have been very satisfied . However , the recent stay will be our last until a major renovation takes place . Also , the service in the restaurant was almost non - exist ##ent . The wall ##paper is p ##eel ##ing . There was mold in the shower area , etc , etc . I was told that the hotel is going to undergo a renovation in late 2017 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I feel like all of my glowing reviews of the Kim ##pton properties are driving up prices , but I still have to do my part . In a nuts ##hell , we were going to Chicago . I looked at the Kim ##pton properties and chose this one . ( The Monaco ##s ' interiors are all similar and I love them ) . This one , had an added surprise I didn ' t read about in the reviews . The rooms have window seats that over ##look the amazing views ! Every room has deep windows with " I Dream of Jean ##nie " type cushion ##s and pillows . Plus , the windows have heavy curtains to en ##c ##lose you , so I lounge ##d in comfort every morning with my compliment ##ary coffee and newspaper , overlooking the Chicago river and sky ##line , while my husband and son slept und ##ist ##ur ##bed . Cool ##est thing ever . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie has a premium location . But , the staff made our stay one to remember . Starting with Ni ##c in reservations who answered all my questions . Thank you to the folks at the front desk , especially G ##ism ##era ##it , Gerry and Drake . They love what they do and it shows ! ! ! ! Would definitely recommend the Ki ##ni ##ze Hotel to my close friends and family ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a pretty solid overall hotel particularly for the price . Pro ##s Location : It ' s at the north end of the mile but still close to al ##ot of great restaurants and bars . Room : Extreme ##ly spacious rooms with the proper amenities Price : It ' s a bit lower than other comparable hotels in the area . Con ##s El ##eva ##tor : They were down to one elevator for our stay ( the other was under work ) and it was a small one at that . It took ages for it to show up and was often full . They urged you to use the stairs but we were on the 15th floor so that ' s a bit rough . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was clean . Bath ##room and room were very nice size for a week long trip to Chicago for a business conference . Nice place to stay with close proximity to H ##ya ##tt Regency for conference . Nice feature to decline daily house ##keeping service and receive credit to use in restaurant in hotel during your stay instead . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chicago O ##m ##ni Hotel - Great location , just a few blocks from Water Tower place on Michigan Avenue . Got a nice package that included $ 30 credit towards meals at their very price ##y restaurant . Clean suites , friendly personnel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel and staff was very good , location perfect . All went well . Easy to walk around downtown to ##sh ##ops and rest ##au ##rn ##ts . Would return for along ##er stay next visit , just need the weather to be more agree ##able in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , with great de ##cor ##ac ##ión , but with a extremely expensive parking 62 dollars per night , quite expensive . Room 53 ##3 with the u ##gli ##est view of all , a lot of chimney ##s and trash in front of the huge window How could it be possible to charge so much for this ugly view room and expensive Park ##ing There ##´s a lot of more hotel spots for that price [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and proximity to the city sites . The rooms were spacious and clean . The gym was amazing with spectacular views . The check - in and check ##out process was very quick and easy . The personnel were very friendly . I did not have any issues with my stay at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great location and an ups ##cale property to spend a Thanksgiving weekend in Chicago . Steps from Di ##t ##ka ' s and Water Tower 2 blocks down Ch ##est ##nut to Ma ##g Mile . 2 blocks to Morton ##s or Carmine ' s at Rush and Division . Another bonus if you don ' t need in and out v ##alet is the public parking deck right next door saving about $ 30 daily . Who needs a car at this location ? Walk to everything . Great view of the lake . So ##fit ##el has a more continental feel and fl ##air . Very nice rooms with marble or granite bathroom ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is very well maintained . Old style but with modern flare and convenience ##s . Staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Both room and bathroom were love ##y ! This is my second time there and will happily at ##t again . Room was very warm but window opened . If I said something , I ’ m confident they would have ft ##ake ##n care if it . I will definitely return again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The two PM Front Des ##k Agents Ashley and Ash ##anti were both a great help when i got to the hotel . I was lost and they both worked together to give me walking directions to the hotel . After i walked for a hour . They were also very knowledge ##able of the area and gave many great suggestions on spectacular food . They both had G ##RE ##AT Po ##sitive attitude and personality . That of which you don ' t see all ##ot of these days in the hospitality industry . They were swamp ##ed a bit and made sure each and every guest got their und ##iv ##ided attention . Service like that I Believe is worth more than what hotels in Chicago pay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The All ##egro is a convenient ##ly located , beautifully maintained hotel with an extremely friendly and eager - to - help staff . Room ##s are well - appointed , and the hotel is ready to provide almost anything you may have forgotten to bring on your trip . Another bonus : the work ##out room is great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every time I stay at a Kim ##pton I enjoy myself immensely . This was no exception . The hotel was beautiful , co ##zy , and happy . The location was great , too ! Just one turn off from the window . Op ##t for a river view ! It was great sitting in the window frame looking out over the city . The only unfortunate part is that the Trump Hotel is in sight . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie is a central ##ly located hotel in Chicago . The staff was very helpful and court ##eous however there are a few draw ##backs to consider before booking this hotel . First , if you have a car , the v ##alet parking is $ 63 a night . Plus , if you book with Ex ##ped ##ia or another hotel booking site there is an addition 14 % + fee . The room service is from the Public House restaurant next door which has great food but the hotel doesn ' t have a kitchen on site . There is a cold b ##uff ##et breakfast set up outside the elevators which was included and featured rock hard c ##rois ##san ##ts and cold cereal ##s . The room was comfortable and relatively quiet . I was lure ##d by the price but once you added all the extra ##s the same value could probably have been found elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bo ##uti ##que hotel a few blocks from Michigan Ave . Recently renovated older property that has lots of charm . Staff was very friendly . Within walking distance of most Chicago tourist attractions and shopping [SEP]
1	[CLS] My favorite hotel in Chicago . Close to magnificent mile and the Chicago river . There are window seats to work and watch the world go by . The wine happy hour with ta ##sty app ##eti ##zers is a plus too . Friendly staff and great door ##man . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service at this hotel was wonderful . Staff are extremely helpful , polite and friendly . It is very comfortable clean and modern . We were upgraded to a larger suite which was amazing . The bed was really comfortable - as always in So ##fit ##el ! It is also in a really good position for restaurants , shopping & experiencing the city . I would definitely stay here again . Well worth the cost ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was great ; lots of light for people like me who like to read , and be able to see in the bathroom mirror ! Breakfast was absolutely spot on ; wonderful , delicious , just great food . Location is perfect for shopping . Staff was extremely helpful . Couldn ' t ask for a better experience in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##cel ##ente location and services Amazing resort location at the heart of Down ##T ##own Chicago You can go walking ever ##where . V ##ey Friendly all the staff . Restaurant ##s and bars just beside the hotel . Pretty near from ##e Navy Pier . The restaurants of the hotel great The pool is great , The kids love it , and the spa pool too [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have never been disappointed by a Kim ##pton , and Hotel All ##egro is not an exception . Central ##ly located within the Loop and within walking distance to Mill ##ennial Park and lake ##front , we even walked to the Navy Pier . Also very near the train for easy transit . Take advantage of the social hour every day at 5 ##pm and free w ##if ##i for reward members . Bring your dog for free ! Kim ##pton doesn ' t just tolerate your pet , they really do welcome and we appreciate that . We had a King suite and found it to be spacious enough for the two of us . Also , very easy check in and check out . Thanks Hotel All ##egro ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile is a very nice hotel . The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated . The staff are very court ##eous and helpful . The hotel is situated ideal ##ly within walking distance to the shops . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for work & loved the feel of the place . Great atmosphere . Sure , it ' s not all shiny & new , but that ' s what I liked about it . Q ##ui ##rky sense of humour & style . Only a few blocks from the park & lots of local theatres . My first time here but hopefully not my last [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conference . Room ##s were clean and comfortable . Staff was very friendly and willing to help . The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Chicago . Close to the bean , the pier , and other great restaurants and bars . I would definitely stay here again . I would recommend this hotel to friends and family . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We very much enjoyed our stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . The service was spectacular . The room was lovely . The location was perfect . We walked everywhere . We didn ' t have a car so cannot comment on parking . We did not notice excess noise . I cannot think of a single thing that wasn ' t excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to stay at this hotel because we ##´ ##ve stayed at other Home ##wood Suite ##s and it ##´s always great . This one was no different . The hotel offers free breakfast and dinner ( from Monday to Thursday ) . The room was clean , and had a microwave , a fridge and dish ##wash ##er . The hotel staff is very nice and the location is great ( there ##´s a subway station just a block away ) . I recommend this hotel for future visitors and I would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ##t do it they like to charge 300 for bull ##c ##rap . We stayed over the weekend and litter ##aly slept and got ready was out and about 90 % of the time i have b ##list ##ers to prove it . . . I feel they don ##t need to a ##vert ##ise false crap n give people what they pay for queen ##s not full ##s stay away or u ##r bank account will pay [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the hotel , but we did not care for the restaurant . I am always disappointed when a Hilton Hotel does not have a restaurant that I really like . Perhaps they don ' t have the kin ##ks worked out but the service was extremely slow . I miss the options from the old Conrad - I liked their breakfast options better . We did like the bar in the evening and the view is f ##abulous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location . The rooms are spacious , clean & comfortable with a few m ##od con ##s that you wouldn ' t see at other hotels . Staff friendly and welcoming . No wait time for the elevator , there is always one waiting for you . Any down sides would be that the rooftop bar is highly over ##p ##rice ##d . The incident ##als charge of $ 100 per day is also excessive and puts a massive hole in your budget if you are staying more than one night . I would recommend this hotel but make sure you budget for the excessive charges . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was left at the airport for over an hour waiting on a shuttle that 2 front desk employees told me came every 20 minutes . I confirmed my location twice and nothing for an hour . I got to the hotel and when I explained what happened they said “ Oh , we don ##t know if he ##s here today ” The “ fitness center ” shown in the pictures didn ##t exist . Their idea of a fitness center was dropping 4 t ##read ##mill ##s and half a free weight set into an unused conference room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service was excellent throughout my stay . The staff were present , professional , engaged , polite and helpful . I was there for a conference . My room was clean , fully stock ##ed with towels , soap ##s , etc . The cost of access to the lounge is a bit price ##y at 75 . 00 per day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location on magic mile - Michigan Ave . Older hotel but quite nice and very helpful staff . Price was great . Easy to get to by taxi though not easy for them to stop out front - but the blue line train from Oh ##are Airport drops off several blocks away ( great for avoiding traffic jam ##s and costs $ 10 one way ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] this hotel has fallen behind big time ; the height of the chair in the room was not adjust ##able . I ' m 6 ' 0 " and using the table was uncomfortable so if you are less than 5 ' 9 " forget it , the table will be up to your neck ; I called , no ##pe ! not adjust ##able . amazing . the fridge is one of those 1970 ' s types - touch the contents and you get charged and no room for you to use it ; come on She ##rato ##n - these are " features " of yesterday ; switch the format to something more mode ##n ; view was nice to 2 * but first impression of service . . . poor [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Fair ##mont to attend a business meeting held at the A ##on Center which is attached and convenient . Had consistently long waits at bell station , check in and restaurant reception . Bath ##room had chip ##ping paint and some mold . Ex ##pect ##ed more from a luxury chain . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is amazing . The staff is on point . The rooms or beautiful , clean and welcoming . The location is the best ! We were welcomed every time we entered or left the hotel . It is definitely a hotel that is worth the money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended a wedding at this hotel so it was the perfect place to stay . The location on Michigan Avenue just north of the river is great . We arrived on a very busy Saturday afternoon . It took about 30 minutes to get luggage delivered to the room which was understand ##able considering how busy the hotel was with guests checking in . All employees we encountered were very friendly . The room was spacious and clean . Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had been to Ambassador Chicago many times prior to pan ##de ##mic . I came back after v ##ac ##cin ##ation so I was not too worried about exposure . But of note , they were very organized and careful regarding CO ##VI ##D pre ##ca ##ution ##s . They have a service they contracted with so that you can order food all day delivered to your room and it tasted good though I thought quite over ##p ##rice ##d . The beds no longer felt the same since the last time I was there - different mattress I think , though not bad and very different pillows . Place still looks the same with the same lovely atmosphere and the staff were V ##ER ##Y nice , welcoming and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we pulled up to the v ##alet until the time we checked out - we were impressed with the service and efficiency of the staff . Every employee that we encountered left a persona ##ble impression . The hotel is clean and the rooms are nicely decorated . We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed the selection and quality of the food . We will stay at the O ##m ##ni when we travel to Chicago . ( The location is ideal ! ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was convenient ##ly located next to all the sights and attractions we wanted including restaurants . Our room was surprisingly spacious . High end bed ##ding and towels , beautiful view . Every convenience . Very elegant , hip and current . We will stay there again for sure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A little disappointed , The hotel is nice and the staff are very friendly but upon returning after a day out we found our honor bar door a ##jar . I tried several times to get it to close to no avail . I rear ##ranged bottles ( big mistake ) finally when I gave up , returned all bottles to original position and settled with leaning a pillow on the bar door to keep it closed . Shortly after I discovered someone ' s snack une ##ate ##n on the dresser ( I think house ##keeping struggled and gave up and forgot to take their snack when they left ) . Next morning when I was reviewing my in ##vo ##ice I had been charged for liquor . When I informed front desk , they said they would take care of it but I have yet to be email ##ed the updated re ##ceipt so I now have to take time to pursue that issue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Of all hotels in Chicago . . . . . . . we booked this one ! So good . Best value . Best location . Best hotel bar If you want VA ##L ##UE for money ( as opposed to cheap ) this is the place . Check in smooth quick helpful . Champagne to greet you on a Friday . If u check in another day they are at the lift on level 3 ( reception ) and you are welcome anyway ! Room fault ##less . House ##keeping f ##abulous Staff friendly and can ' t do enough 67 ##6 bar and restaurant offers excellent food , beer and service . The locals pop in - what better recommendation can you get ? ! O ##m ##ni Chicago is right on ( almost middle ) of Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Move over Peninsula - this lot deserve your crown Make sure you visit Sunny ##S ##ide Up and Coffee Shop for breakfast . One block up and across Have fun ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing Place to stay & Staff is Great . Everyone On the staff was amazing and so helpful . Room ##s are clean , full compliment ##ary breakfast was amazing ##ly good . Location is so convenient to everything . I love this place ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First of all , the Fair ##mont chain is still one of the best in the world . They bend over backwards to make your stay enjoyable . However , the Chicago Fair ##mont is showing some wear and tear . The furniture in my suite was worn and dated as was the carpet ##ing . However , the room was very clean and the bed the usual Fair ##mont comfort . With the executive lounge closed , it looks like it may be the beginning of a renovation process . I hope so as this is a great location with great people working there ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for work and was impressed with the level of customer service . The hotel restaurant staff was exceptionally friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ( I am g ##lut ##en free ) . The fitness center is clean and has nice equipment and the rooms are comfortable and updated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was greeted by friendly staff , stayed in a very modern and comfortable room , and enjoyed a ta ##sty breakfast the next morning . Other per ##ks were easy check out , text communication with the con ##cier ##ge , and a happy hour for all guests . Would recommend this hotel to others and will absolutely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk people were very court ##eous , hotel itself was very nice , room was clean and fridge well stock ##ed . The only concern I had was the room te ##mp / heat ##er . I couldn ' t get the heat ##er to work . Ke ##pt adjusting it up but never seemed to get warm . Had it set to 80 by the time I checked out and still was cold when I slept . Room # 35 ##2 [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff here are absolutely te ##rri ##fic ! Very quick check in and out . The check out time is later so you have time to go to breakfast and make it back in time . The rooms are spacious and we had a rivers ##ide view so that was great . The only complaint I had is that the mattress ##es are ex ##tre ##m ##le ##ly hard and we woke up with a back ache so for that reason I wouldn ' t stay there again . This hotel is in a great location for shopping , and restaurants , close to the train station and Mill ##eni ##um Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is in a brilliant location for shopping , sights and restaurant . Just seconds from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Room ##s are large and bed was very comfortable . Free water and Diet Coke was a nice touch . The employees all friendly and helpful . Breakfast in il ta ##vo ##lina was good too . High ##ly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was good size , clean , quiet and comfortable . House ##keeping was wonderful ! However the pillows were much too soft , we need 4 each , the lighting was inadequate making the room very dark and din ##gy feeling . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended a conference there . I should say one of the conferences . Don ’ t stay there as an individual travel ##er ! Out ##lets are invaded by conference participants and service is poor . I believe the bars are under ##sta ##ffed and render ##s their mission quite complicated . I was assigned first a nice room in the East wing adjacent to the elevator shaft . I require a room change and unfortunately ended up in the west wing , not as nice and dark as facing another tower . Also noisy ( vent ) . The conference rooms are in the basement with no natural light . De ##pressing . I must be fair and point out that food served for banquet ##s was decent . PS . If you drive there , forget the GPS that brings you at the lower level of W ##ack ##er Drive . You have to look for upper W ##ack ##er drive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A really good hotel , half a block from Michigan avenue in the Miracle Mile . Nice rooms and excellent service , I had a problem in my room that was quickly fixed . It has a nice bar in the lobby , with live music , the staff was friendly . Good value for the price ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great time hotel was awesome close to the miracle mile for shopping and restaurants on Michigan Ave . Staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . S ##hout out to Guillermo for being so ho ##sp ##ita ##ble and caring every morning he would suggest places to go and shop and every ni ##te he would ask us how are day went . BR ##AV ##O . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I think this hotel was probably great in its hey ##day but now it feels outs ##ta ##yed , old fashioned and in desperate need of an update . The room was fine but again , felt very old fashioned . The bathroom was also very out ##dated and s ##mel ##t of pipes and sewage . I don ’ t know if they have refurbished floors but definitely check and ask to stay in one of those . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two nights , 17th floor . Lots of room and fairly quiet . City view amazing . Hot breakfast was included , good choices . We used v ##alet parking , easy and no problems . Room was clean The sofa bed in the living room is not great and the extra pillows were very uncomfortable . The pool is on the 19th floor , very nice and well heated . The location is excellent , lots of choices for restaurants near by and Michigan Avenue basically a block away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Location was great ! Pool us a plus if you travel with kids . Service was ok . Room value is on the average side , can find cheaper hotels with the same or better quality if no need of pool . Rest ##oran ##t was really good at the hotel ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Historic Character with updated amenities . Great central Downtown location , close to everything ! Bath ##rooms were a bit tiny but it comes with an older building . Pro ##xi ##mity to all of the downtown attractions is a great feature ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I must preface by saying I have not stayed at this hotel , but booked it for a trip in December because I have stayed at Hotel Monaco ##s previously and really enjoy them . Had some confusion when someone else in our party booked another hotel as a surprise and was forced to call Hotel Monaco less than 24 h ##rs before to try and cancel our reservation . What I found when I did so was tremendous customer service from every person I talked to . For a frequent travel ##er like me , this means everything ! On a trip to Philadelphia last month we stayed in the Monaco because of this experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really ? Are we still trying to s ##cam guests by charging for touching the mini bar items and hoping they won ' t notice ? It ' s annoying for everyone to have call to get the charge removed . But I guess you ' re playing the percentage ##s ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and customer service . The rooms were beautiful and you can ' t beat the location in proximity to the River ##walk and lake . I enjoyed my stay . The staff was very helpful and professional . The hotel was busy but the staff took care of us . I was there for business and the seminar went great . It was all very well organized . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , facilities and comfort were all f ##abulous ! The pool area is lovely and they were showing movies in this space . The gym is well equipped but bring your own head ##phones for the equipment , they are not supplied to guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here whilst attending the GB ##TA conference in August . Love ##ly hotel , friendly staff , great location . Not a massive fan of the breakfast . Room ##s were really nice and big , very well equipped especially for someone who is travelling on business . Would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cool bout ##ique hotel with an awesome ma ##rt ##ini bar . Close enough to most areas to walk . The people were very a ##cco ##mo ##dating and helpful when looking for a nice restaurant to finding and holding my Boston Red Sox jacket that I left in the ma ##rt ##ini bar . Would highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location right on the river . At check - in , my 7 year - old ask for a room with a view . Since it was a Wednesday and I doubt the hotel was full , De ##met ##rie told him he would see what he could do . We ended up on the 36th floor with a great view of Navy Pier . The hotel is located within a short walk to Mariano ' s , Mill ##eni ##um Park and many other attractions . We have stayed at 7 other hotels in the River North / Mill ##eni ##um Park area and the Swiss ##ote ##l had the best location for what we wanted to do ! We didn ' t try restaurants or other amenities in the hotel but just wanted a clean / comfortable room in a great location ! Thanks De ##met ##rie ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 2 nights for an office event . The hotel lobby and ballroom ##s are p ##ala ##tial . The rooms , while relatively smaller than typical downtown hotel rooms , are well decorated . Hotel is a stone ' s throw away from the popular tourist spot - Cloud Gate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay . The hotel is central ##ly located , making everywhere we wanted to go an easy walk . The beds were very comfortable and the staff was very helpful when we asked for restaurant ideas . We would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the Fair ##mount for two nights . We were on the 33rd floor and it was very quiet and relaxing . Pro ##s : The room and bathroom are decent size . The mattress was very comfortable and the staff was helpful and friendly . Con ##s : The room wasn ’ t cleaned very well upon arrival . There were c ##rum ##bs on the floor and table from previous guests . Room ##s are a little out ##dated but still nice . Overall it was a lovely stay and the hotel is close to tourist attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The kids loved the pool ! The hotel is also very clean and in a great location ! But what made this stay so magical was Din ##ka , the hostess at the Center Court restaurant at the Intercontinental , overheard my husband wishing our 5 year old a Happy Birthday . We finished our breakfast and headed back to our room and soon after we received a call asking if we would return back to the restaurant . As soon as we walked in Din ##ka started singing Happy Birthday and there was a piece of 23 layer chocolate cake ! It was the sweet ##est thing I ’ ve ever experienced at a hotel . Would strongly recommend ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our first time in Chicago did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint and left us wanting more ! The hotel is perfectly located to act as a very convenient base from which to discover how beautiful and en ##er ##gis ##ing the city is - we ran out of time but that just means we can come back ! The hotel is more than adequate providing just above average commodity for what we needed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed here several times on visits to meet up with friends for a few days in the Wind ##y City . The two bed suites accommodate three good friends well and are s ##ty ##lish , clean and well designed . If your activities include exploring the Gold Coast or Michigan Ave shopping , the location is ideal . The on site restaurant offers small plate dining and is rarely crowded . Slow response this visit to a request to swap out feathers for synthetic pillows , but the let me check in early so it ' s a wash . Jo ##in their loyalty club and enjoy free morning beverage delivery . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly , personal and comfortable — stayed 5 nights traveling solo and the Swiss ##ote ##l ’ s central location put me within easy walk ##able distance to museums , restaurants and concert halls . Compared to its larger neighbors , the Swiss ##ote ##l ’ s at ##ten ##tive service makes it feel like a bout ##ique hotel . Co ##zy bed ##ding , spacious room , and te ##rri ##fic view of the f ##er ##ris wheel in Navy Pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked the American Girl package and could not be happier with the hotel and the service . My granddaughter was treated like a little princess from the time we arrived till our departure . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed being close to everything . I also liked that Whole Foods was right across the street , it made things so convenient for us . Would stay here again . Pool was small though , and did not eat inside the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good hotel with nice location . Their service is good but their club lounge area gets very busy and they are not able to keep up . Con ##stant ##ly running out of food . Overall the experience was good . Room ##s were nice , clean , and well maintained . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel and very quiet . We got the family package that includes breakfast and parking . Within walking distance to the Field Museum and She ##dd A ##qua ##rium . Kids had a blast ! Will be staying again sometime soon . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love this hotel ! From the greeting at the front door when you arrive to the parking lot attendant on the last day pulling away , I always feel welcome , cared for , valued and p ##amp ##ered ! The room was beautiful , in fact I recommend asking about the Suite ##s when you book ! We had a group of 4 in town for a meeting and the suite allowed us to have privacy and a space to work together at the same time ! ! It was amazing ! It feels like living in a luxury home , in the heart of the City ! The breakfast b ##uff ##et was awesome , the Star ##bu ##cks in the Lo ##bby doesn ' t hurt and the Holiday Dec ##or is a treat ! I spend about 35 nights a year in hotels across the country and The Palmer House in Chicago is by far my favorite one ! Thank you for setting the standard for E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##CE in Chicago ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This place is amazing and everyone who works here are rocks ##tars . I randomly picked this spot when i first started working in Chicago and little did I know how welcoming this place would be . I will never stay anywhere else now in Chicago . Everyone here is now family and I can never go anywhere else Thanks to everyone here that makes me feel so welcomed and I am so grateful for you all [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff at this hotel works very hard at making certain that their guests are taken care of all needs . From the moment of arrival , you are greeted by Tony or Ben ##ji and your experience begins . This is an o ##asis of friendly , con ##s ##cie ##nti ##ous and effective staff throughout the hotel . You realize that the culture is maintained from the front desk manager , Joe B , to room service , house ##keeping and so on . The Gold experience is relaxing and if there is time during your stay , a place to read . The food quality is excellent , but most importantly , the staff makes your visit extraordinary . Del ##ores , in the Gold Lounge has a keen awareness of making certain that all of the guests are happy . Del ##ores is professional , adding to the moments that become fond memories . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Maybe it ' s just an older hotel . . . but the room was tiny and had uncomfortable D ##O ##U ##BL ##E beds . The only red ##ee ##ming quality was the lemon scent ##ed toilet ##ries . For the business travel ##er , this hotel would be fine . For a family of 4 , it doesn ' t work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a historic bout ##ique hotel . The lobby was beautiful . They offer Pro ##se ##cco every night for an hour in lobby . My room was on the small size but well decorated . The bathroom was very small with an oddly large sink basin that took up most of the counter . The elevators were under renovation and running very slow . The hall ways were dark , yet charming in an odd way . The location was just a few blocks from Macy ’ s and shops and was in the heart of the theatre district . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome place to stay ! Location worked great for us and the staff was amazing ! They went out of their way to say “ yes ” whenever we had an ask . And Julius at the front desk was amazing ! ! High ##ly recommend ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great building , the rooms are ok . The views are a bit limited , but great stay and very close to everything in downtown . The pool was closed , So we couldn ’ t try it . Great breakfast selection , but would be p ##ric ##y if it wouldn ’ t be included . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A f ##abulous find in Chicago . Love ##ly rooms , very comfortable . the bathroom was exceptional . Very clean with all them amenities . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed and pillows and quick w ##if ##i . the staff was very friendly and the food in casual restaurant / bar ( the only one I tried ) was excellent . Very well located . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family stayed at the Talbot for the night while in town to see Hamilton . Gorge ##ous room and lovely amenities . Staff on the check in desk were super helpful and the free drinks at the bar were much appreciated ! Love ##d it , great location and big rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great to see this Hilton brand taking on the other big names in Chicago . There are a few big name hotels in the city but seldom of them live up to the h ##ype . The Conrad however is modern , central ##ly positioned with a great restaurant and terrace bar . My room was spacious , the bed as ever very comfortable and there was a huge and modern bathroom . Breakfast was an expensive add on - about $ 40 a head , and the roof top su ##shi was also a bit over ##p ##rice ##d but given its location to be expected . Try the Has ##h Brown breakfast and ma ##rrow starter . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Weekend stay with wife to visit daughter . Great location with easy access to trains , Michigan avenue , etc . Good room with couch sitting area . All served the purpose . Service staff at door and check - in were quite helpful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Travis , one of the outstanding booking agents at Ambassador Chicago , provided very professional and g ##rac ##ious service during a sad time for our family and friends . Travis was especially easy to work with in securing a book of rooms for out of town guests . Our guests were delighted with the service and accommodation ##s at the hotel and the delicious food and service of The Library and Booth One restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every thing was great and way cool hotel . Service and great attitude from all staff . Was close walking distance to everything . Great time walking the River walk way . Off ##ers free bicycles for use and free internet if you sign up to their site . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d everything about this hotel . Service was fast when i needed something and called IS ##C centre . Check in was smooth . Girl was friendly . Hotel is beautiful and great location . View from my room was great from 34th floor ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is awesome , it has everything you need to make your stay in Chicago the best ! The bathroom is clean and it has a bath tub , the bed is the most comfortable one I ' ve ever slept in and the view from the 17th floor is great . I didn ' t have a chance to go to the restaurant in the building but it has a Star ##bu ##cks in the ground floor that you could go to if you are in the mood for coffee . Also , it has a great location and Millennium Park is walking distance ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just recently return from my business trip in Chicago . Stay ##ed Five Days / Four Nights at the Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park . Pro ##s : Location : Con ##ven ##ient location , walking distance to Millennium Park , restaurants and shopping . I can walk to my training or about a $ 10 U ##ber ride to downtown . Room : Modern , large room with a good view . King Si ##ze bed was comfortable , soft bed ##ding ##s , pillows . Bath with a separate shower and a bath tub . The bath amenities was excellent . To ##we ##ls were soft and new . In room coffee maker . Service : Friendly staff , house ##keeping was excellent . Con ##s : Internet : Slow internet . Overall I was very happy with my stay . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This , I believe , is one of the most state ##ly hotel properties in the country . From the grand stairway ##s to the ornate ##ly decorated rooms , this place will impress . However , the room amenities leave a lot to be desired : no coffee maker , slip ##pers , or any add - on ##s that make comparable hotels more appealing . Nonetheless , the de ##cor , location and friendly staff carry the o ##lace . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t to Chicago for family matter ( wife ’ s cousin ) . Beautiful century - old , very large hotel . The lobby ’ s ceiling has beautiful paintings . We had 4 breakfast ##s and 2 dinner ##s at its Lock ##wood restaurant , all of which were ta ##sty . The first night we had a steak . Had the 5 oz . , instead of the 10 oz , because I didn ’ t think think I could eat the larger size . If the larger had been 8 oz . , I would have got it instead of the 5 oz . The chef knows how to cook medium well . The only q ##ui ##bble was the bed . Thought we were getting a Queen , instead got a double . Next time will book a King sized bed . Plan on visiting Chicago again and staying there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location and clean ##liness of the room . Check - in was quick and staff pleasant . House ##keeping was very nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Water te ##mp in shower was warm , but couldn ' t get it hot . Room safe was broken . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at the Talbot ##t Hotel in Chicago was f ##abulous because of Perry he took wonderful care of us in every way . Great customer service and room service etc he ' s one of a kind and hard to find . My ##self and our family will be returning there in the near future [SEP]
1	[CLS] Date ##d and needs lots of up ##grading - we were disappointed . The restaurant leaves a lot to be desired and the workers were very un ##friend ##ly . They need to work on this . It is in a great location but . . . there are so many other options [SEP]
1	[CLS] I liked how comfortable the rooms were . I ate breakfast each day and one dinner . My group was very impressed by the quality and taste of the dinner we had there . Great location to where we need to go and for great restaurants ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My first time in Chicago . We stayed in a very nice suite , with very com ##fy living room , bed and very spacious . W ##if ##i free and working well . Breakfast offered some nice options for ve ##gan ##s . Staff at reception very helpful and friendly . Location very close to main shopping streets and to metro and sky train so we moved around very easily by Public transports which in freezing January was very important . Two blocks away we found one of our favourite bag ##els place , Einstein bag ##els . I would definitely re ##cco ##men ##dation ##s this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came into town for my birthday . We ended up parking 3 blocks away with a coup ##on because it is $ 67 . 00 a night to park at the hotel . Room is quite nice . We did have a s ##li ##ver of a view of the beach . The fridge was filled with their stuff so we took some out to put our drinks in . The bathroom was high end - in fact the toilet was so high when I sat on it , my feet were dangling . Funny thing is the toilet paper was hung low to reach . The shower seemed beautiful but luck ##ily I got directions from my husband because I don ' t go into the shower with my glasses on so the nicely la ##minated sign to explain how it works was of no use to me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Many of the outlets , f ##au ##ce ##ts didn ' t work in the first room and asked to change it and improved slightly but had a problem with the the ##rm ##ost ##at and couldn ' t warm up the room . The rooms were not too clean . Con ##cier ##ge service was poor and had angry staff but could be Chicago thing . The pool was under maintenance for a while and had no mentioning of it anywhere . Don ' t expect Hilton standard and you will be happy with the stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s very dated , needs some up ##lifting . Draw ##er space is odd - placed in closet ##s so not much room for longer items to hang properly . Room ##s with connecting doors - you can hear every word / noise from next door ! Hotel really needs to do something about noise proof ##ing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Most of the hotels where I stay for business look the same , so I was surprised by the very modern look and feel of my Conrad Chicago room . A narrow mirror lined most of the room , the cabinets lights turned on when doors were opened , and there was a N ##es ##press ##o machine . The bathroom had within it a separate room and door for the toilet , which is convenient if more than one person is staying in the room . It was unusual , beautiful , and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family has made a tradition of meeting in Chicago for Easter weekend with Saturday exploring and dinner , Sunday worship at the Moody Church and br ##unch at Shaw ’ s C ##rab House . I found a great rate at the Hotel Monaco and that put us in really convenient proximity to all the places we planned to go . The staff was wonderful , the rooms were great . Park ##ing is expensive but . . . Chicago . And the v ##alet ##s were very good as was the bell service . I ’ d highly recommend and I expect we will be back . [SEP]

We will see you again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel , great location . Tri ##es to cut corners by no longer offering free newspapers , you have to request a room coffee ##maker a day in advance , raised the upgrade charge for breakfast to $ 14 , room service apparently not available til after 5 ##pm . Room attendant ##s and restaurant workers very helpful . We stay at this hotel 4 or 5 times a year and try to down ##play the def ##ici ##encies . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very nice hotel ! The room was a nice size , clean and nicely decorated . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located near great shopping , restaurants and several Chicago attractions . The staff was friendly and service was phenomena ##l . Made for a great weekend get ##away . Can ’ t wait to go back and we ’ ll definitely chose this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location but the Hotel is tired , over ##p ##rice ##d and in need of a renovation . This was my third time staying there and my last . Much better choices in Chicago . The staff are friendly and knowledge ##able . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel recently and had a wonderful experience . The de ##cor is so lovely throughout the lobby and rooms . Up ##sca ##le room furnishings are very evident . The rooms are not large but that didn ' t matter to me . I ' m all about those details and they exceeded them . The food at Baptiste and Bo ##ttle was delicious . As were the unique cocktail ##s they offered . Service was also very at ##ten ##tive . High ##ly recommend this property . Plus , it is steps from the Ma ##g Mile ( Michigan Avenue ) ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I along with another couple stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker and we all can ' t stop talking about how great the entire staff and our stay was . Every staff member was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our every need and went beyond in many instances . I can ' t wait to find another reason to stay in the city , I will definitely choose this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located in Chicago , very helpful staff and nice clean rooms . A close friend left a back pack full with knit ##ting material close to the elevators in the Lo ##bby level . He called me for help 20 minutes into his taxi drive toward the airport . Personnel at the Front Des ##k and later Security were immediately very helpful and in less than 10 minutes they brought the back pack with everything in . My friend didn ' t have to leave the taxi since I gave it upon his return to the hotel . Great team ##work at H ##ya ##tt help him not to miss his plane . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 2 nights . Up ##graded as Platinum to nice corner room overlooking the river . Room ##s are a bit tired . Show ##er had some good wear . Bed was pretty com ##fy . AC was not working well and after 30 min on hold to front desk I requested someone come look but no one ever did . I won ' t be staying again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super place to stay , just on the edge of action , only steps to El , Ma ##g Mile , etc . I stayed in a huge room , 5 days on business . Very comfortable , excellent sleep , quiet , and treated well . Most importantly it was very clean . Would absolutely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the de ##cor , super clean and friendly but professional staff . Great Location . Quality of food ( needs step up ) to be according with the hotel . Very comfortable bed & great rest ##rooms , set up , size & de ##cor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always a great time . Staff is helpful and court ##iers . Love my room simple and clean . Small issues of wear and tear like rip ##s in carpet etc . Great location , nice neighborhood , great Restaurant ##s , close to the beach of Lake Michigan . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for a business trip and I really liked it . The service is very good , the people from the con ##cier ##ge was very helpful . The room was very nice and modern and it wasn ' t small at all . The location is excellent , close to Michigan s ##t . where is all the shopping . I also had breakfast in the restaurant , which was very good as well . I would certainly come back to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker and there were some in ##con ##ven ##ience ##s that we encountered . The room and halls were incredibly hot , even with the room heat turned off it was still about 80 degrees in the room . The AC had been switched off for the season . Thankfully , we could open the window to cool the room off or we would have had to check out . There was no hotel directory / room service book in the room . I honestly don ' t even know if there was a restaurant in the hotel . The room was clean and the bathroom ##s looked like they had been red ##one in the last few years , had a nice shower . It is a great location and on a quiet ##er street than staying right on Michigan , the rate was reasonable , but my overall impression was me ##dio ##cre . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They over ##book ##ed our type of room . So they gave us a suite for the first night and let us stay there the rest of our trip at no additional cost . It was great for our kids . Much more room . Everyone there was really nice . It ’ s a great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Price ##y , but the hotel staff are te ##rri ##fic , the experience was truly wonderful . The library b ##as was an excellent place to grab coffee in the morning , the pump room ' s food was delicious and the rooms were beautifully cleaned . Walls were a little thin though , which made sleeping a challenge on night ( but only one ! I stayed for 4 days ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was great - from the time we checked in with Mile ##ka - to when we ##le ##ft - the bar is beautiful - just had the best experience - our room was beautiful - clean ##and well decorated - we even got upgraded to s suite ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] L ##O ##VE ##D this place . Super friendly people and great restaurant and bar area . The rooms are clean - but carpet ##s a bit dated and need more outlets . . . but it is an old building . Love ##d the location ! I ' ll be going back . Nice and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suite set up is great for families . The kitchen is fully equipped . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds , including the hide a bed . Great staff . excellent breakfast and able to take a tray back to room for other family members . 1 block from red line and 1 block from Mi ##ch Ave = excellent central location for all Chicago areas . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at The All ##egro was great ! New ##ly re - decorated , s ##ty ##lish and up to date . Everything about this hotel is good , great location , style , value for money etc . Would definitely come back again ! Very convenient with a Star ##bu ##ck on ground floor ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are small . Fu ##rn ##iture was quite beat up . Guest terminal in the room did not work . One of the glasses in the bathroom was cracked . No air conditioning yet for this time of year , but windows jammed shut and te ##mp at 80 degrees . Bath ##room is fairly new , but shower is terrible , has instructions on shower wall on how to keep yourself from getting s ##cor ##ched or frozen when turning it on , either of which seemed inevitable . Re ##mote for TV didn ' t work . H ##OW ##E ##VE ##R , staff was very friendly and fixed problems promptly and court ##eous ##ly . The location in the heart of Chicago is hard to beat and the price is reasonable for this part of town . Good music in the lounge weekend nights . Good choice if you are in town to enjoy the city and not spend a lot of time in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently went to Chicago with my family and we stay at the Hilton . It ’ s very expensive , and I could have done without most of the extra things inside of the room . We had two bathroom ##s , a microwave , and a mini fridge . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was in Chicago for a business trip and enjoyed this central location . I love being in downtown Chicago . My room had a great view too ! The hotel service was great too ! There are several attractions and restaurants within easy wa ##ling distance from this hotel . If you are looking for authentic Chicago - style pizza , G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s is just a couple of blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice Stay on a cold day . The rooms were comfortable and clean . I was welcomed to the World of H ##ya ##tt program and received a Star ##bu ##ck gift card . Lea ##rned about $ 20 upgrade for me room which was really nice . Only improvements I suggest is the room service hours and the temperatures in the rooms [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient location just steps to Michigan Avenue and in the heart of shopping , restaurants , activities . Also one of the most luxurious hotels we ' ve stayed in , and surprisingly affordable - - though we got the mid - winter rates , I ' m sure . The service was stellar from check in to check out , and the whiskey bar / restaurant on the 20th floor is worth the trip even if you ' re not staying there . St ##un ##ning views of the city and excellent food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every single staff persons that I encountered was so nice ! The hotel is nice but the rooms are not extra ##va ##gant . The location is in the center of everything . I would highly recommend this hotel . However the basic rooms don ’ t come with mini bars or concessions . Court ##es ##y is everything ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is clean , rooms are nice . If you don ' t plan to use the pool area , you ' ll be happy . The pool is very cold . I always come with the grand ##ki ##ds who expect me to be in the water with them . I won ' t be back because this has happened the last couple times I was there . If you aren ' t using the pool , it will be a pleasant stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was probably my fifth time at the inter ##continent ##al and again , they did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . I asked for late check out , done . I asked for milk with coffee , done . I wanted to work in a quiet room , done . Everything was clean and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at The Talbot ##t for one night as we were in town for a Broadway show . Our room was a very good size and we really enjoyed being able to schedule room service for the next morning . The late check ##out time was also very nice ! The hotel is also ideal ##ly located and made getting around the city incredibly convenient . The staff was very friendly and we really enjoyed our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was exactly as described in its profile . It is well located and the staff were very kind . It has a very traditional big old hotel feel . It was quiet and comfortable . I did wish there was a store or coffee shop in it , but the staff at the door were able to easily direct me to somewhere nearby . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Me and my wife spent Christmas and new years at this hotel . The hotel itself is really nice and all the staff working here are very helpful the hotel is in a great location . The rooms are spacious and the River ##view rooms which we had have great views . The wine Club is A nice touch and a great place to meet other people . If we visit Chicago again this hotel will definitely be our first choice as we could not fault this hotel for service location and friend ##liness . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very nice experience at this hotel . We have 6 in our family , and we fit comfortably in the suite . There is a nice kitchen ##ette if you want to eat in . The staff was very friendly , even the bell guys at the front door . They offer a free hot breakfast in the morning , which was nice , so we didn ' t have to worry about eating out for breakfast . Location is great , and right in the middle of everything . About a 15 minute walk to Navy Pier . We would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a room in July 2019 , I was traveling with my family so we got a one room suite with living area . The room was spot ##less , had a king bed and fold out couch . A TV in each room with a bathroom and hall separating the two . The room was spot ##less and pool is awesome and huge . They had a movie night in the pool the last night we were there which was a hit but a little too young of a feature for my 10 and 12 year olds . The text service system was great , they notified me of things going on in and around the hotel and whenever I asked something ( like where is the ice machine ) they went above and beyond and brought me anything we needed . It was a great place to stay on the mile close to everything there ##in . [SEP]
0	[CLS] BR ##ING BA ##C ##K THE M ##O ##U ##LT ##ON BR ##OW ##N PR ##OD ##UC ##TS ! The Jonathan Adler branded products are of inferior quality and even worse now that they replaced the travel size with large pump top bottles . The new food items in the Bar are Fantastic ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was going to Chicago to see Phantom of the Opera at the Cadillac Palace Theater , and wanted a hotel close by . The Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro is right next door . It ' s a beautiful hotel , clean , the woman I spoke to at the desk when I checked in was friendly and even checked in on us after we had got to our room to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed . The price for our room was more than generous for such a nice hotel and a perfect location . I would happily stay there again . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Front desk staff made my stay ##cation awesome ! Room ##s were clean and spacious , enjoyed the pool with my kids . Walking distance to the water tower and a lot of other stores ! Found parking on Spot hero , not to bad a 5 minute walk from the hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was perfect for our tour of Chicago . P ##lent ##y of shopping and eating close by on the Miracle Mile . Beautiful , modern hotel with large comfortable rooms . F ##abulous products and a ton of closet space allowing you to un ##pack and spread out . P ##lent ##y of wonderful touches . A great deal for the money ! Staff was very warm and at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In ##tro ##duced to Swiss ##ote ##l via a professional conference . Un ##ex ##pect ##edly , I had to make several changes in the reservation . I spoke to someone at the desk , who answered the phone immediately , and who was so professional . She understood what I needed and handled it right away . Upon arrival , I was kept current and totally informed by Roll ##o , another wonderful ##ly court ##eous and capable employee . He puts his 29 years of experience to great use ; directed me to a wonderful breakfast , and later even escorted me to the p ##ed ##way and other retail establishments . Other staff were also pleasant and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Grand facade and entrance with fully dressed port ##ers and con ##cier ##ge in an elegant setting . Once upstairs , it ’ s the usual American experience of ugly loud doors and endless carpet ##s . My room had a good view , but was so cold ! No wonder , the outside walls were thin and it was - 3 ##C outside . Not quite what one expects for a 300 USD per night hotel . You can put the heating on the whole time , but that ’ s un ##hea ##lt ##hy and unpleasant . Fi ##x ##tures and fitting ##s needed up ##dating too . Not worth the money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] … and again we had a great time in the All ##egro Chicago hotel . Stop looking for another hotel if you planning to visit Chicago . The All ##egro is the perfect balance . Easy access to all Chicago attractions ( Michigan avenue State street , the millennium park , theaters , shops , bars and … and … and ) And the hotel itself is a piece of art ! Beautiful Lo ##bby , s ##ty ##lish - modern rooms and the friend ##liest staff you can imagine . This was now our 8th stay in in the AL ##LE ##GR ##O . And every time when we leave we are already looking for the next possibility to come back to Chicago … back in the Hotel AL ##LE ##GR ##O . Thanks Rachel and Iris for making our stay always memorable . [SEP]

0	[CLS] This is my second stay at Ki ##nz ##ie and it hasn ’ t disappointed . This place truly makes me happy . Despite the tons of options in Chicago , we won ’ t stay anywhere else . Check in and check out were easy and effort ##less . The location can ’ t get more perfect , we walked everywhere ! The amenities are great and the hotel is very welcoming ( in a very special and personal ##ized way ) . Room ##s are clean and spacious with very fun Chicago - like details . Breakfast is a nice treat and happy hour in the evenings are awesome . Staff is so kind and very at ##ten ##tive , especially the bartender at happy hour ! They helped with recommendations , transportation , and truly made our trip better . You won ’ t go wrong with Ki ##nz ##ie ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel multiple times and the service is outstanding ! The staff make a big effort to make every guest ' s go well . The hotel has a beautiful modern style . The higher floor views have a great view of the lake and the W ##rig ##ley building . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we see the Kim ##pton name we know the type of service we will get along with outstanding accommodation ##s . The Hotel All ##egro was no exception . The front desk staff was amazing . Bryant immediately recognized our area code as being from Atlanta and gave us a southern welcome . Leah was was awesome as well and helped us check - in quickly even though we literally had just booked on - line . The hotel meets the high standards that we come to expect from Kim ##pton Hotels . Co ##m ##fort ##able , unique , and high class . Can ’ t say enough about this place . Stay here if you can . And if you want the best Martin ##i you ’ ve ever had at a hotel , saddle up to the bar and enjoy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I wanted to like the hotel - I really like Beaux Arts architecture and the building is beautiful . Seems like the food outlets are popular , though I ate elsewhere and can ' t comment . However , pretty much the entire rest of my stay was disappointing ; the room product needs up ##dating , the house ##keeping effort is lack ##luster at best ( con ##ge ##aled coffee cream ##er and stained sheets ? No thanks ) , and the rooms are noisy as all get out . On top of it all , the hotel charges for same - day luggage storage . I won ' t be coming back next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here this past week for a few days for business . Check - in was fast and easy . They had me down for 2 Queen beds , which was a mistake , though the check - in lady quickly fixed and was able to get a king size bed . Big thanks . The room was clean and decent sized . Not much of a view , but I was here for work . I was on the 23rd floor which was very quiet , and away from the noise of the lower levels and the conference that was there . There are a few nice restaurants in the Hotel . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend Kitty OS ##hea ##s . Check ##out was efficient . Even though the hotel is a bit older , and has its charm and is clean . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although I was in Chicago for work , I was able to use the afternoon and evenings for personal time and for my first time being in Chicago , the O ##m ##ni was perfect ! I was right on Michigan Ave and wasn ' t far from all of the wonderful experiences Chicago has to offer . The room d ##é ##cor was amazing . The staff , from the desk staff to the bell ##hop ##s , were very friendly and helpful with everything ( directions to places , recommendations of places to visit , hail ##ing a cab , helping load my bags into the car , etc . ) . My plane was an earlier flight ; however , the hotel allowed me to check in early since a room was available . This will be no to go hotel whenever I need to come to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The online views of rooms and lobby look great . Unfortunately , unless you are quite wealthy you will receive a very standard and tiny room . The service was not great , I would not stay in this location again . Lo ##bby bar , good luck getting any service . I was just overall un ##im ##pressed by this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , com ##fy beds but tired d ##rab de ##cor and pit ##iful pool . Odd odor in entrance area . Had lunch and cocktail ##s at restaurant which with good service and food . Pool was cloud ##y and re ##ek ##ed of ch ##lor ##ine . I am sure it is difficult to maintain due to small size . No rooftop bar . For the money much better options in the city : Thompson , Kim ##pton ##s . If you want to s ##p ##lu ##rge The Peninsula is always perfection ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a fantastic location with great views of the river , the lake , and the city . Staff is helpful and kind . Going back again in April . Higher floor rooms do have great views . I had the breakfast b ##uff ##et in the restaurant , it was very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location and facility were fine , but an item disappeared from our room and we got lip service and and email response indicated it was being " looked into " . However when called several days later , we were told that they had no record of the complaint or problem being reported . Additionally , the use of water in the bathroom above us sounded like Niagara Falls was next to our room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was great , the location is perfect , and the staff awesome ! D ##wayne was exceptional , once again ! . Walking distance to great shopping , superb restaurants , and close to the red line as well . Will definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently had a 3 day conference at the Swiss ##ote ##l and everything turned out great and all the staff were super helpful ! Ku ##dos to Veronica , Peter and C ##J for helping us and always reply ##ing so quickly to our request ! Thank you Sean from PS ##AV for running our presentations so smoothly ! The conference turned out great and everything exceeded our expectations ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] great locations , no f ##rill ##s , clean , great breakfast / bar area . however , this is more of a place to just stay the night , not a hotel experience to enjoy . the room was small ##ish but functional . I ' m not sure if all rooms had windows . Staff not super helpful [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cut ##e hotel ! My husband and I were here for the Chicago marathon , so I am not sure of the " best rate for this hotel " . Very small room and bathroom , the picture attached with this review is not de ##ceiving . Staff was friendly and there is a Star ##bu ##cks attached to the hotel . The hotel is walking distance to the river and Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton hotels are always top notch . We have stayed in all of them in Chicago . The all ##egro follows suit here . Service imp ##ec ##ca ##ble and rooms are beautiful . Lo ##bby areas beautifully decorated . They make you feel like you stayed there many times and one of the family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is not worth the cost . The room is very small with an uncomfortable bed , and hardly any room to walk around . The walls are thin and you will hear everything going on in the halls and next to you . Most of the bell ##man were rude except one . You can find other hotels in the city that is the same price with excellent service and amenities . This is a very basic hotel , and my experience is comparable to a Mo ##tel 6 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in this hotel when visiting the sites in Chicago . The very best part is this hotel is in a prime location , the entrance is on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The rooms were clean and t ##idy . Wen ##t to the pool area to take pictures . This is a g ##em of an old style of hotel , when buildings were grand . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel again for business and can ' t get enough of this property ! The rooms are a little dated but that is the only negative . The staff are great and has a good lobby area for a social drink / coffee . I had ordered room service for dinner and the quality of the food was good and vast . The food arrived very quickly and was reasonably priced for a hotel . I will stay here again for my next trip to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Hotel A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions During my Conference . The associates were pleasant and professional . The hotel is located within walking distance of Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shops and restaurants . I would definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel and its staff were excellent . I just had a few minor issues - c ##log ##ged shower drain , construction noise that kept me awake and the promise of free w ##if ##i that I was never able to connect to . That being said , the O ##m ##ni Chicago is an excellent hotel in a great location with nice rooms and at ##ten ##tive staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Warm Welcome at the reception Everything Looks modern Nice And clean , the Suite i got was in an Upper Level which i can a ##bs ##ol ##ut recommend you have a wonderful view over Chicago And you also can see lake Michigan [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great hotel . Including the Art Dec ##o de ##cor . Hu ##ge room , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , comfortable beds , excellent b ##uff ##et breakfast . You ’ d expect it to be noisy , a block from the El , but it was very well ins ##ulated . We ’ d certainly stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The bed was comfortable so I slept well . Room service was pro ##mpt and I had a great view out my window towards Lake Michigan . Only down ##side was the shower head didn ' t flow very well . Overall , I would choose this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great location , very comfortable , very clean , good food great service ! and great past ##ries and cheese and drinks in the bar ! just 2 blocks away from water tower and Michigan avenue , rooms are spacious and modern . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you ' re looking for a first class hotel , with no f ##uss , look no further ! Ki ##nz ##ie hotel rooms are lovely , staff very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , cheerful and so kind . We didn ' t expect breakfast but we ' re delighted with the ' Help yourself ' b ##uff ##et every morning . A tray is in your room and you take it along to the end of the corridor where a great selection of b ##uff ##et a ##wai ##ts . No staff present - just help yourself ! On top of this , we received token ##s for free cocktail ##s to use in the lovely , b ##ub ##bly bar area . Again , superb staff ! Another surprise - free lit ##e bites in the bar . Such a treat . We can ' t wait to return and would H ##IG ##HL ##Y recommend Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel to others ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at the inter ##continent ##al was excellent . The location and amenities proved to be excellent on all fronts . From the spacious room and firm mattress to the compliment ##ary beverages and coffee and fresh fruit tray to the time ##ly services and help from all staff , guests from far ##away Montana could not have asked for more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t for a convention at M ##c Co ##rm ##ick Place . Bus stopped right around the corner . Eat ##aly is on the same block . Hotel is nice clean rooms . Suite ##s on corner offer nice views . Wish windows opened . Full kitchen and lot of spread out room . Wine and heavy snack ##ed for dinner during weekdays . Breakfast is free and way better than the Hampton . Room ##s have been renovated and look nice but pop ##corn ceiling coming down . B ##um ##mer . Room 131 ##8 Would stay there again close to Michigan Ave and lots of places to shop and eat . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a delight ##ful experience ! From the moment we stepped foot in the door , we felt welcomed by the staff . From check - in to the con ##cier ##ge to the cleaning staff , we were welcomed with a smile and a friendly greeting . We happened to visit on a gorgeous day in Chicago so we enjoyed sitting out on the patio and having wine and an app ##eti ##zer . Later that evening , we visited the bar and enjoyed that as well . The room was clean , comfortable and enjoyable . A 5 star stay in our books ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have never wrote a review before but felt compelled to after my most recent experience at the O ##m ##ni Chicago . We have 4 kids under the age of 7 so trying to find a hotel with the so ##phi ##stic ##ation that my wife and I want , along with a hotel that is kid friendly can be difficult at times especially in big city downtown ##s . With the location , friendly environment especially for our kids and class ##y feel we get when we stay here , we would highly recommend this place for business and pleasure . This last trip was our 4th in 5 years at this hotel and we will continue to make this our first choice every year we go to Chicago as a family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this place for a night doing a work meeting and it was worth the stay . I didn ' t booked it here but due to the Hilton over booked they bounced me to this hotel and at the time I was upset , once I arrived to my amazed it was better then the Hilton I booked for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was a great place to stay in especially if you are attending any of the broad ##way plays . The rooms are very nice . The staff is extra friendly . There is usually a happy hour where wines are served at no cost . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check - in and out was super easy . The hotel is located in downtown Chicago . My room was very nice with a spectacular view . The staff was great - very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . My business conference was located within the hotel and breakfast and lunch was provided . Great Stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was in town for a quick business meeting . Just stayed one night . Overall , very quality hotel and very court ##eous and helpful staff as you would expect at a hotel like this . No complaints ! Would stay there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love coming to this property when I visit Chicago . The Regency Club and rooms with access to it are by far worth the cost . It is so convenient to stop by for breakfast or a late night snack . The kids will love it too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel with professional staff . Room was very clean & overall satisfied with the property . The location was outstanding . F ##lew into Midway & took a train to within a couple of blocks of the hot ##e . Wen ##t to W ##rig ##ley field & again the stop was right at the ball ##park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fr ##ict ##ion ##less check ##in , nice room and very central ##ly located . Room ##s were quiet , not huge but comfortable . Across from a 7 - 11 so if you need anything it ' s easy to get . G ##ym is OK , not huge but was OK for a short stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We only stayed for one night but the rate was reasonable , room was very clean , decent location . Historic building . Irish Pub located inside . Buddy Guys Blues Bar is right behind the hotel . We walked to most places we wanted to see and caught an U ##ber back . Overall it was a great hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall great value for money . Hotel has it all , helpful and professional staff , great location , nice appointments , restaurant and bar service were good . Overall I highly recommend , especially for conferences . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Great staff . New ##ly reopened at new location one block off Michigan Ave . Urban v ##ibe in in lounge bar and excellent selection of b ##our ##bon ##s . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms with views of the city architecture . Excellent experience overall . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having not stayed at Home ##wood Suite ##s before I was pleasant ##ly surprised by the quality of the room , the pool , and the warm breakfast . The staff was polite and the check - in very easy . The location was perfect with a Star ##bu ##cks across the street , many restaurants and shopping in very in short distance from the hotel . The price was reasonable for that area . We would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel with a wonderful 15th floor lounge and g ##rac ##ious staff who made my business stay a real pleasure . Man ##dan ##a and her colleagues were always there to help . The hotel is comfortable and near walking paths , the park , the lake , and the river . And convenient to my office and shopping . I love this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good stay at the Hotel Monaco . Love the location as it has easy access to Millennium Park , River North , Miracle Mile and more . While the lobby is under ##w ##hel ##ming , the staff is friendly and helpful and the evening wine hour and morning coffee are always on time and well presented . The hotel rooms have undergone a recent renovation and they are very nice indeed . W ##him ##si ##cal , colorful , and well lit ( a pet p ##ee ##ve of mine ) with high quality flat screen t ##v on the wall . Bath ##rooms are a bit small but well appointed and offer standard Kim ##pton amenities . Only suggestion , not a complaint , is the lack of Netflix access on the television . High ##ly recommend that they add this option . Excellent hotel and a definite value in the Chicago market . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean nice rooms . Friendly service . Near everything ! We had a small issue w our room not being ready and they were beyond a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Probably third time we have stayed here and won ’ t be the last . Park ##ing is a little tough w the new Star ##bu ##cks next door ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is fantastic . The room was clean and spacious , and the compliment ##ary breakfast and evening beer / wine and light dinner were very nice . The staff is outstanding . I love hotels that do not have that loud window air conditioning unit - this hotel ' s air conditioning is nice and quiet . I also love having a full refrigerator and stove ##top as we always have dinner left ##overs that we enjoy for lunch the next day . The only needed improvement is their W ##IF ##I - really slow . If needed ask the staff for a W ##IF ##I boost ##er for the room - that helped . I would recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you value bright , up ##beat color themes , new and modern surroundings , big rooms , a bath ##tub and decent elevator service , this is not the place for you . Though I value those things , I still rate this place highly for the following reasons . Every employee , from maid ##s to security , to door ##men and desk people - - everyone was friendly and acknowledged me . Sometimes even county club resorts can ' t say their employees do . The free wine is a nice touch , the location is great and amenities are p ##lent ##iful . Everything in the room worked well , and there were always staff around to make sure I was satisfied . The v ##ibe is cool and ups ##cale , and service at high levels lets you enjoy your stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont Chicago completed a Million $ renovation and to be honest . . . . they did a great job . The rooms look amazing ##ly re ##f ##resh ##ed , the staff is super helpful and friendly and even if there is a big conference in the hotel , it does not bother at all . It is a short walk to downtown , which is nice , as it is a bit quiet ##er , you can see Millennium Park from your window and reach it in two minutes by walking . This hotel has an awesome value for the money paid and if we ‘ re back in Chi ##ga ##co , we ‘ ll definitely gonna return ! Thank you for an amazing stay Fair ##mont Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visit Chicago annually for family fun , shopping , dining , etc . we have stayed at the O ##m ##ni on multiple occasions and always have a great experience . The rooms are excellent and the staff is welcoming , friendly and helpful . The bar and restaurant are also excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l did not inform me at the time of booking of their transformed level of service . Having visited this hotel on at least ten prior occasions , I was not prepared for the unpleasant ##ness that I encountered - no room cleaning , trash piled up in hallway ##s , no breakfast . It ' s unlikely I ' ll stay in this property again . The location is excellent , and the view of the river delight ##ful , but the hotel is tired looking and dirty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Swiss ##ote ##l was a fantastic first part of our stay in the USA - it ’ s perfectly located with just a short walk into main downtown Chicago and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile - the only down ##side was parking as there had been a dispute with the g ##ara ##g me opposite which and a walkway to it - reception advised that they had a disagreement with the new owners and they couldn ’ t advise of a location close to park at ( which I thought was poor for such an established hotel ) either way we parked at the said garage opposite without any alter ##cation [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hu ##ge hotel that need to be renovated . Poor ##ly run overall with slow lines for check - in , very slow and di ##sin ##ter ##ested restaurant service and a general lack of concern for the guest . P ##lent ##y of other options in the downtown Chicago area to stay at instead . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I could not be more pleased with the service I received at the Swiss ##ote ##l . Their customer service is second to none and made me feel welcome from the time I arrived until check ##out . They are extremely at ##ten ##tive to every detail which provided for a pleasant weekend away . Thanks to all the incredible staff at Swiss ##ote ##l ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the check - in to the check - out I had a wonderful experience at the hotel . The rooms and especially the beds are very comfortable . I particularly appreciated the business lounge with a free drink and app ##eti ##zers after work every day and the breakfast b ##uff ##et on my floor with a grab and go option in the mornings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Court ##eous and professional staff . Close to everything - - exceptional restaurants and shopping . Walking distance to the Red Line , theaters , Chicago River tours , the Art Institute . The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile is three short blocks away . On my next visit to Chicago I know where I ' ll be staying - - the So ##fit ##el ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location . Help ##ful staff . Clean rooms . Great co ##vid - 19 procedures , even with guests who were reluctant and called co ##vid a ho ##ax . We were especially impressed with their handling of a guest protesting mask ##ing . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I chose the Chicago Hilton because of its amenities and in - out parking included in the cost of the room . If you ' ve never visited Chicago , you ' ll soon discover that parking can be expensive ! Our stay here was extremely pleasant . The bed was super com ##fy and the Herb ' n Kitchen was perfect for the breakfast grab and go , or grab and hang around and have a leisure morning . The free W ##i ##F ##i and pool were frost ##ing on the cake . Excellent job . I ' m sure we will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was good but room could use up ##dating . The wall ##paper was p ##eel ##ing and other aspects of the room had not been attended to or updated for some time . Staff was good and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . Location was good too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sure can use a re ##f ##resh of the rose colors in the rooms . Car ##pet ##s and furniture are very out ##dated . Low light in the living area . Base ##boards around lobby need paint / repair . Looks good until you look at the room and fur ##nish ##ing detail . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved on December 21 in Chicago for the birth of my granddaughter . Hotel was near my daughters apartment , I received an excellent reception and un ##believable low rates on the short notice . Room was perfect . This is my new base when visiting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing con ##cier ##ge service provided by the best , David . He was very helpful and kind . I asked him where I can find a tail ##or around the hotel to fix my coat , and he literally se ##wed my coat ! So thankful for his services . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got an earlier flight in needed a room to change and get some work done before an e ##al ##ry dinner Te ##rik B . Too ##k less than 5 minutes to accommodate . Thank you for getting my weeks long stay off to a good start . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was tiny but nice and clean . The service was great . The room was hot and we could not turn on the AC . The location was perfect . The staff was nice . We had a great breakfast . I would not stay there in the summer . ( no a ##c ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always a good experience . this is my first experience since the hotel was re ##mo ##del ##ed . Room de ##cor is nothing out of the ordinary , but well kept and quiet . Would have preferred a street view - had a view of another room at a right angle although the window was covered , so no privacy issue . Service very good . Lo ##bby experience and check - in very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##ab hotel very spacious rooms staff very helpful breakfast great plenty to eat great choice staff awesome friendly chat ##ty hotel security helpful very busy hotel Only down ##side was a server in kit ##ty O ' Shea was miserable abrupt probably not under the Hilton The v ##alet guys in car park were awesome [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a fantastic location . The staff is top notch . There were no weak links . From the door ##men to the front desk to house ##keeping , every staff member was friendly , welcoming and eager to help . It is a p ##ric ##y hotel but comparable to others in that Michigan Avenue location . That being said it is best to join the O ##m ##ni Select Guest program . You will receive free w ##i - fi and other things to make your stay quite superb . The rooms are large and quite comfortable suites . It was a great place for our Girls ' Weekend . I recommend it highly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bus ##y but every one was great door person , front desk , breakfast personal to house ##keeping . We enjoyed this hotel . it was close walk to ma ##g mile for shopping and restaurants . The red line to W ##rig ##ley and bus straight to navy pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the location was great for what we were doing . Walking distance to many things , including the Navy Pier , American Girl , and Garrett ’ s pop ##corn . The kids movie on Saturday night was a big hit for us . The hotel sent up a very large piece of cake to our room when they found out it was my daughter ’ s birthday . Very nice ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We wanted a great location ( which happens to be right next to the new Star ##bu ##cks R ##oast ##ery ) where we could walk to shops and the Museum of Contemporary Art . Our room was quite spacious ( 500 + SF ) with large windows overlooking the city . This new hotel has a bout ##ique feel with very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . We ' re coming back next year ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great people working here . It makes for a great experience . The grounds are in great shape for an older property . Worth the price and brings you in a prime location to access downtown . The grocery store access across the street on the corner is very nice as well . The rooms are very quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A H ##U ##GE disappointment . This use to be our main ##sta ##y for our weekends in Chicago mostly because of the location , service , and facility . All of that has changed . Room ##s were marginal ##ly cleaned . Sin ##ks did not drain . We did not get service to the room until after 3 ##pm . Not cool after a day of shopping . The cherry on top was that our keys would not work and we waited in the hallway for over a half an hour ! We will NE ##VE ##R E ##VE ##R R ##ET ##UR ##N . So sad as this was such a treasure for us , now just a party hotel for 20 year olds ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had four rooms all of which were good rooms . Very well - kept and clean . Some of them could ’ ve had a little more attention to the p ##lum ##bing fixtures . We had a suite and three other rooms this week worked out great for gathering . The breakfast is in the morning were more than you could expect from a normal breakfast free with the room . Ernest made the mornings delight ##ful . The hotel is situated close to so many attractions and great restaurants . We will definitely return [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel and excellent location right on Chicago river . Steps to Michigan Avenue , short walk to Art Institute and Mill ##eni ##um Park . Room ##s are large and comfortable , excellent lobby bar with light breakfast available . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband treated me to an overnight stay for my birthday . Our room was clean and had a great view . There was a compliment ##ary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered straw ##berries upon arrival . We would most definitely stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel All ##egro is a beautiful hotel with a great historic feel . Even though the lobby is on the second floor , it provides a wonderful atmosphere . They offered a f ##estive happy hour and I enjoyed a drink just off the lobby in a room that had the feel of 1920s Chicago . The front desk sent me a text just after I checked in to make sure the arrangements were acceptable . I replied with a comment about my appreciation for the historic feel and they texted me back with a link with additional information about the hotel . The hotel is convenient ##ly located near several shops , stores , movie theater , etc . It is close to the Chicago River ##walk and near the theater district . I had an enjoyable stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a block of rooms for a company holiday weekend . Denise at the front desk was an absolute rock star ! We had guests check in later in the night after long travels and she out ##di ##d herself making everyone feel so welcome . I would book again solely for the genuine hospitality she displayed . Thank you Denise for making our visit amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] De ##fin ##ite ##ly one of the best fur ##bish ##ed rooms I had a chance to stay in . Spa ##cious , wonderful equipment ##s and appliances , great bathroom , details have obviously been thought about by competent hotel professionals . Although I don ' t watch TV , it ' s the biggest TV screen I ' ve ever seen . The fitness room was great although difficult to find since it ' s at the 8th floor and poor ##ely indicated . Sorry that the light switches are so complicated , since ta ##ct ##ile and written so little you have to guess by trying each of them how to switch off the appropriate light . But that didn ' t s ##po ##il the overall experience . Also , fantastic location in the heart of the magnificent mile . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I arrived at the All ##egro with only one night booked but due to changed business needs , I had to stay another un ##p ##lan ##ned night in Chicago . Rather than have me pack up and find another hotel miles away from work , Leah and Paige kept checking for me on potential cancellation ##s and pro ##active ##ly provided an added night as soon as one came available . They saved me from a dread ##ed extra day , searching for another place to stay and for that I am grateful . Thanks to Leah and Paige ' s efforts , I am a devoted Kim ##pton All ##egro fan for life ! Many k ##udo ##s to you two . . . you live the " Service Re ##ign ##s Supreme " motto ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were charged for taking out and setting back in the mini bar stuff , they did fix the bill after it was addressed several times . And the house cleaning kept knocking on the door while I was in the shower before check out , was told to put the privacy tag on the door if I don ’ t want a cleaner knocking . . . so stress ##ful [SEP]
1	[CLS] I arrived at the hotel at 2 : 00 pm . I had not eaten any lunch and was hungry . I asked the front desk if the hotel had a restaurant that serves lunch . I was told no ! The only place in this hotel to eat was a Star ##bu ##cks that had one sandwich and one salad . Neither looked fresh . Then supper time came around . I went to the restaurant within the hotel ( a steak house ) . I am on a travel budget . I ordered 4 shrimp and a baked potato ( $ 35 ) . I will never recommend this hotel to anyone ! ! W ##i ##F ##i does not work if you leave your room ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location for visiting Chicago University was good given the proximity to the university as well as local attractions . Was not a comfortable stay due to the poor quality mattress and traffic noise from the street . Large bottles of s ##ham ##po ##o , condition ##er , etc appeared to be left from prior guest as bottles were not full - unsure if this is a typical practice but found it to be un ##san ##ita ##ry . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lost some of its charm , no attention to detail , lacking in supplies and amenities . The lounge is still nice but the Bar area isn ' t intimate as before . Bath ##room was average to poor , no Rob ##es for lo ##ung ##ing about , No bottle ##d water . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room was very large and the hotel was right in the heart of Chicago . Most everything was within an easy walk , and it made our stay very enjoyable . All the staff were pleasant and happy to answer our questions or provide directions . I will definitely stay there again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The people working at this hotel are amazing ##ly nice which is the only reason im giving it 2 stars . The hotel itself is dated a ##f and i leg ##it had to pop an all ##er ##gy pill because i started getting hi ##ves and my lip was getting pu ##ffy . I checked out a day earlier than i was supposed to because i was afraid to stay longer due to the issues I was having . There was a strong chemical ##ly smell in my room ( like b ##lea ##ch ) and i think that ##s what caused the reaction but i would definitely not recommend staying there ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We hosted our wedding at Hotel All ##egro in Chicago . Everyone had a f ##abulous time . Not only did they r ##ave about the high level of service and friend ##liness of the staff but they were awe ##st ##ru ##ck by the beauty of the hotel . They thought it was incredibly s ##ty ##lish . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for one night while on a lay ##over with my airline . The best part was that not more than a couple of blocks was a great br ##unch spot . Let alone all the other eat ##eries and things to do . Nice ##ly situated in the tourist ##y part of the city it ’ s a great hotel for one night or multiple . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here recently for a work conference . The rooms were great from a size and clean ##liness perspective . I felt the staff were all welcoming and helpful . Star ##bu ##cks was downstairs which was another plus . I did not leave the property much but was close to all the shopping and many restaurants so good from a location perspective . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The neighborhood was great . The hotel was clean and the guest floors were clean but worn . The rooms were small and basically furnished - what I expect from a property at this price point in a large city . The 24 hour room service was a plus - despite it being a very limited menu ( and the pricing was what you ' d expect in a large city . ) Travis and Garrett were fantastic to deal with . We ' d definitely stay at this property again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent facility with a clean , quiet large room . Professional and court ##eous employees who not only knew their hotel but the events in and around the facility . Fitness area and pool was not available during my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in September and weren ' t informed about the strike . We were woken up early the next morning to the employees banging pots and pan ##s . The coffee machine in our room had not been cleaned and we found the grin ##ds of the previous guests in it . Some charges for beer and pop were added , which we did not drink . They removed most , but when I went over the bill when I got home , not all had been taken off . I sent an email to the hotel , but never heard back and was never issued the credit . The location was great , but we will never stay here again . This is not a cheap place to stay and you expect more when you are paying that much . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in was quick and easy , and we really appreciated the per ##ks of the hotel - it was convenient ##ly located to pretty much everything we wanted to do , compliment ##ary beer / wine / snack ##s at happy hour , continental breakfast , friendly staff , a bunch of Chicago information in the room , etc . We were here on a Saturday and Sunday night and even though we were only on the 2nd floor facing the street , it was very quiet and peaceful each time we came back to our room to rest . Everything was clean and modern , and our regular King room / bathroom was spacious . Check ##out was also easy , no need to stop by the front desk since a re ##ceipt was slipped under our door and you can check ##out using the TV . We ’ ll definitely be back soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A beautiful place for wedding . Our daughter had an elegant wedding there in April . The entire hotel staff , and the Chris Sc ##hm ##itt the wedding coordinate ##r were amazing . Breakfast , lunch , dinner , wedding , reception all events well coordinated in different halls and rooms in hotel . We as well as our guest loved the van ##ue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a couple of days to celebrate our wedding anniversary . Every person working at this lovely hotel - door ##man , bell ##boy ##s , front desk , con ##cier ##ge , maid ##s , and those in the rest ##ura ##nt were friendly , helpful , polite , and very happy . The room was great . Had these wonderful window seats that we could watch the people . The rest ##ura ##nt had y ##um ##my food for breakfast ( wonderful jam ) and dinner . Location is great - short walk to pretty much anything you need . We will definitely come back . We loved our time here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price of the room ( and parking at $ 60 per night ) , the offerings of this hotel fell well below expectation . The compliment ##ary evening social has very limited food selections . The quality of food at the compliment ##ary breakfast was very poor . The suite was very nice , but the air conditioning in the suite was inadequate to properly maintain a comfortable temperature in the room . Park ##ing was either in their garage ( $ 64 per night ) , by their v ##alet ( $ 59 per night plus tip ) , or in a nearby garage ( the closest was a block and a half away at $ 40 per night ) . With 17 floors , the two elevators they offered were extremely inadequate . I will not be staying here again , for business or leisure , when I can have a much better experience at a Hampton Inn for half the cost . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were clean and spacious . Staff was friendly . Hotel location was ideal for me . I would most definitely book again during my next visit or recommend to friends or family . And the bacon at the restaurant . Wow . Del ##ish . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I arrived in the evening for our stay . We only stayed one night and upon check in , the staff , specifically Daniel Flood ( manager ) was extremely helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting towards us . ( We had our pet with us ) . The overall welcome was superb and our room was very comfortable . I will definitely be recommend ##ing family and friends to stay there when they come visit us . We just moved from California to Chicago and it was the nice ##st welcome for our new lives here in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Feel of old world charm with grace . Location can ' t be beat . Service was excellent . Walk to your favorite restaurant or shopping or a short cab ride if you prefer . Lo ##bby Bar perfect for meeting friends or people watching . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni offers a great location for either bus ##sin ##es or pleasure . It is on the magnificent mile , so the location of must Chicago highlights is w ##hit ##hin walking distance . I asked to change the room to a higher floor for the sky ##line views and the staff was very friendly and relocated me to the 19th floor ! The view were worth it . The room has plenty of space and everything is very comfortable and well maintained . Would stay here again without a doubt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had 30 rooms for members of our class and from booking , almost a year ago , to check out the staff and accommodation ##s were A + . This was our third reunion in 15 years and our first time at the She ##rato ##n and this was our best stay of the three hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a couple of nights with family . Like ##d : Great location - you can walk to most tourist attractions easily . Nice amenities including Fr ##ette bath ##robe and wonderful ##ly scent ##ed toilet ##ries . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . Di ##s ##like ##d : No master light switch near the bed even though the night ##light is pretty bright . Room a bit small ##ish . Close ##t is tiny - especially with the iron board hanging inside . G ##ym facility was great overall but somehow the P ##elo ##ton bike seemed to be broken ( can ' t log in or create a new account ) and there was no mirror in the weights area . As an I ##H ##G platinum member , I got a 10 dollar credit towards mini bar / bar downstairs which I found to be useful as you don ' t get free bottles of water here : ( [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here in the One bedroom suite - 1 king Bed . Boy what a suite , separate lounge with all amenities . large bath room suite and fully furnished bedroom with huge king size bed and a view over the city to kill for . We both had a great nights sleep . Great gym and swimming pool . Staff where brilliant and very helpful . Thanks to everyone for making our stay memorable . Location is near all the big shops . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for getting out and exploring the city . We upgraded to a suite which was well worth it - the room was huge , with lovely floor to ceiling windows and a large marble bathroom . Con ##cier ##ge were great with genuinely helpful recommendations . The Hancock Tower is a short walk away and the bar offers great views over the city without having to endure endless que ##ues to enjoy the view [SEP]
1	[CLS] An interesting twist on art de ##co furnishings au ##gment ##s our awesome All ##egro experiences . The downtown location is prime , the service is un ##su ##rp ##ass ##able , and the rooms are quiet and delight ##fully decorated . En ##joy the wine hour from 5 - 6 . although we hope they serve more than b ##ub ##bly as they did during our long weekend . You cannot beat the Kim ##pton experience - we love this hotel ##1 [SEP]
1	[CLS] Try the bar . Very good food and low prices . The restaurant is a lot of fun and service is very good . Good for business entertainment . Sea ##food app ##eti ##zers . Vin ##e selection and coffee was delicious . Am ##bian ##ce [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was so very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The hotel was super clean . We weren ' t far from the Red Line , lots of shopping , and tons of restaurants . We had breakfast at the hotel one morning . It was delicious and very reasonably priced . The beds were com ##fy and the room was pretty big . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is top notch ! I will be back here for sure if the room is available ! Staff was very kind , price was right ! The de ##cor is awesome . Freddy was awesome to my family . . . very helpful . Everyone was great ! the room was clean , bathroom clean . . . . you can ' t ask for better ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time in ch ##ica ##go and we stayed at the hilt ##on ch ##ica ##go , would definitely stay there again , massive shout out to s ##te ##ven who welcomed us and Julius at reception , you were a star , Thank ##yo ##u . [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] was in town for the Phi ##sh concerts in July , got this hotel on price ##line , checked in and needed 1 queen or 1 king bed for my fi ##an ##cé and myself , was told only 2 bed rooms were available so we paid $ 50 a day additional for the club rate . Wasn ' t happy but had no choice but this was actually well worth it , we got free w ##if ##i , free breakfast , free snack ##s in lounge , free beers , was very much worth it for the extra $ 50 . As for the hotel , rooms are out ##dated , needs an overhaul . Location was right at the base of Mill ##eni ##um Park and was a beautiful view , its in the heart of downtown and 2 blocks from the main attractions , we walked to Willis Tower ( about a mile ) , easy walk to the River ##W ##alk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked 4 rooms all on 8th floor ##ing Dec 27 one night stay Three rooms were ready at 3 : 30 the 4th two hours later We out five of the six grand ##ki ##ds in one room I took off the pillow on the long ##e to give to the kids to lay on . Here is where I discovered a sick disgusting sight Food all over never cleaned . This was true on all rooms . All the said was they gave me my room fee back which is 20 . 00 For one room So check your rooms they probably are not cleaned . Or maybe now they might be after I showed the desk pictures [SEP]
1	[CLS] Once again this hotel more than met our needs as a family . The location is great . . . the free breakfast b ##uff ##et is awesome and the happy hour form 5 - 7 is a nice touch . We ' ve stayed here in the past and will continue to again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice property in an excellent location . The renovation appears to have gone quite well . Lo ##bby area is a bit small — but elegant . The elevators are swift and never had to wait . Service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . My only complaint would be the 58 dollar per night parking fee . It ’ s downtown Chicago and it ’ s the norm — but it is still a bit gal ##ling . The room itself was massive . The suite is large and comfortable and s ##wan ##ky . Would ’ ve loved a bath tub — but the shower was quite nice . Great quality soap ##s too . And the mattress ##es and pillows in the large window si ##lls for sitting and watching the world below are brilliant . The staff checked in via text a few times to ensure no service laps ##es occurred . I would definitely consider this on my short list for a repeat Chicago visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] parking is horrible . You have picked up your car yourself Even v ##alet park . I am lost when I drove out of garage . It took a long time to drive back front door to pick up my families . . . . Others are Excellent especially swimming pool [SEP]
1	[CLS] In addition to having a lovely room on the 21st floor , I was so impressed by the service throughout my stay . Thank you to the security guards and to the front desk staff for everything , even the little things , like having an umbrella when I arrived and prepared . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel months in advance from a third party hotel site which gave me a very decent price in a cool hotel such as All ##egro . Initially the mention of the size of the room turned me off as it was really small , about 200 sq ##ft but the modern and smart design of the room made the difference . Check ##ed in at 11 . 30 ##am , and thought we needed to wait til 3 ##pm before our room would be ready but pleasant ##ly surprised to have a room ready for us ! Check in was a breeze ! ! The lobby was so ##oo ##o beautiful with a neo - classic design ! The room as well ! ! Some of the reviewers here mentioned its thin walled room but we had no issue ! Only thing no so great about the room is the bed which was a bit hard and was not so comfortable . . Evening wine time was great ! Will return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco was in the perfect location . It was within walking distance to shopping , restaurants , and many tourist points . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and very friendly . We had written in our online reservation that it was anniversary and waiting in our room was a compliment ##ary bottle of wine and dessert . The room was a bout ##ique style of room . Everything was very clean . The best part was the large window seat that boasted views of the river and downtown . The con ##cier ##ge was right on both times we asked for food recommendations . We will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a business trip , but my wife and 20 something daughter went along . In advance , I had requested a room with a hide - a - bed since my daughter was going along . In a previous stay , we had received a room with a hide - a - bed out of pure luck . It was a very small , tight room , but it worked . This time , after requesting such a room through Olivia L with group reservations , we received what I would call a suite . There was a master bedroom with a king size bedroom and a very large bathroom . The sitting room / living room , where the hide - a - bed was located , had a half bath just off of it . The room was excellent and the service we received from everyone from Olivia , to the front desk , to cleaning staff , to the parking attendant ##s was first rate ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m very pick ##y to say the least and the O ##m ##ni really set the standard . Room , location , v ##alet , and staff were excellent . I will definitely stay here again . I would recommend this hotel for whatever your stay is for , it ' s close to all attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is walking distance to the loop , hotel rooms are quite spacious , lobby is wide and nice if you want to have a quick gathering , for business meetings . Hotel is a nice walk along the Chicago river . You can even j ##og or run along the river . This is also close to river north , where there are a lot of good food options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the leather / mirrored head ##board , to the leopard print bath ##robe ##s , red velvet walls in the elevator and yoga mat ##s on the room I can only say the place is interesting . Show ##er was okay , bathroom space was great , beds were very soft and sunk in ( made for very sore backs and the only reason it didn ' t get 5 / 5 rating ) location was everything - easy to get to Michigan avenue , the bean , and great restaurants and Star ##bu ##cks close . What made the stay the best was the staff - the bell ##man are super friendly ! ! I have never met a more friendly staff - from check in to check out - that made our stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed at She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago many times . The property is well ##l located on the river . The lobby spark ##les . The staff is well trained and guest oriented . The details are executed properly . El ##eva ##tors are fast . View ##s are outstanding of River and City . Guest ##rooms well appointed , and comfortable . There is enough light to read in bed . From the first door ##man greeting to the last , everyone is on point . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quiet location in up ##market area , easily accessible to most downtown attraction by foot or local transport . Re ##com ##men ##d if you obtain discount ##ed rate , otherwise over ##p ##rice ##d for what you get - " free " internet connectivity only at 1 - 5 ##mps , after hours room service a ##by ##sma ##l in quantity and presentation , TV ##s in loft rooms don ' t s ##wi ##vel so awkward viewing angle from bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So overall - not a bad place to stay . The room was on the smaller side but very nice . ( PS - I didn ' t see the yoga mat that is supposed to be in every room . ) The lobby was nice - the free prose ##co in the evening made it a little crazy . The staff during the week were very nice . The staff on Friday were not the best . The lady i talked to was mi ##sin ##formed and tried to act like I was wrong on things . Also my biggest annoyance was that I asked for the early check in and the late check out . At no point was it communicated that these were possible , but they charged me for them . I will probably be much more careful if I ever choose to stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We will definitely stay at this hotel when we are in Chicago again . We will also upgrade to Gold again . Fantastic experience and a great staff . It was a great place to un ##wind and spend time recovering from exploring the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here a couple of nights on business . Dec ##ent location and value . Room ##s refurbished recently ( apparently ) but small and already a bit worn . Room quite noisy due to thin walls between rooms . Don ' t think I ' ll stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this wonderful , historical hotel . Close to Chicago night ##life . Great bar in lobby . short U ##ber ride to navy pier . Staff friendly and professional , view from the room very picturesque . Would stay in this hotel every visit to Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Beautiful hotel in the heart of Downtown Chicago . A great place to stay for atmosphere and am ##bian ##ce , but the room comfort is less than ideal . I would recommend for short trips like ours , but certainly not for anything more than a few nights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the 5th downtown Chicago Hotel we have done a 2 - night stay at , in the past 2 years . All others had annoying issues of one sort or the other ; but Swiss ##ote ##l ' s service , accommodation ##s , location , and comfort ; has been the best so far ! High ##ly recommend a " River View " suite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco was excellent ! We had a beautiful suite with a f ##abulous bathroom . My daughter and I enjoyed sitting in the window seats and watching people go by . They offered free bikes , had free w ##if ##i , and lovely cu ##cum ##ber water in the lobby . When we checked in we noticed the remote control wasn ' t working and my husband wanted a coffee maker in the room . He made a quick call the the front desk and just a few minutes later we had a coffee maker and working remote . Everyone was so friendly and helpful . We will definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights for business . Obviously great location at Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . Check - in very fast and polite , felt welcome . Room was clean and bed comfortable , my preference is a separate shower instead of standing in a shallow tub so bathroom could have been better . Michael Jordan Bar / St ##eak ##house and the wine ##bar were nice . Breakfast at Centre Court was very good as well . G ##ym was ok with separate space for card ##io and weights . But pool was amazing - quite big but extremely pretty in a large space reminding you of time gone by . Next time I will have my swim ##ge ##ar instead of gym ones ! Overall a pleasant experience for business and holiday alike . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just spent the St . Patrick ' s Day weekend here and had a f ##abulous time ! What a perfect location , nice breakfast b ##uff ##et and the M ##OS ##T AM ##A ##Z ##ING staff . We stayed with our t ##we ##en nephew ##s and they went on a s ##ca ##venge ##r hunt on Saturday evening . Heidi and the security staff were absolutely amazing ! We cannot thank them enough for the best stay . The rooms were very well appointed with a full kitchen , plenty of towels , com ##fy beds and again service that sends ice , more towels and anything you need with exceptional speed - I ' ve never seen service this fast in a hotel . The hotel has recently been beautifully re ##mo ##del ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Experience with reception staff was okay . Nothing too friendly , but got their job done . Breakfast staff was ridiculous ##ly un ##friend ##ly , not only to us but also to other guest . Final bill showed an over ##cha ##rge , which was fixed eventually by the reception staff . Guest rooms were clean , but noisy as the AC rat ##tles and the elevator noise comes through the duct ##s . My first and last stay at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The pool is larger than most hotel pools and was very enjoyable when the kids needed to burn off some energy . Staff was friendly and helpful . Location is really good ! Room had been updated except for the bathroom - but it wasn ’ t the worst hotel bathroom I ’ ve seen . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ' t say enough about this hotel . . We had a corner king and it was so awesome . And the added bonus they left in my room . . . Thank you . . I love the breakfast in the morning and the cocktail hour is just what we needed and look forward too . Thank you thank you thank you J ##mer ##ri ##we ##ather [SEP]
1	[CLS] No compliment ##ary coffee in room . Unable to use in room refrigerator without in ##cu ##rring a charge , Had to ask to have bathroom counter dust ##ed . . . this indicated to me the house ##keeping de ##pt only cleaned what appeared to be dirty . Lost electricity in room . While all the issues were addressed promptly I feel at $ 400 per night I should have had NO issues . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I decided at the last minute that we wanted to visit Chicago and opted to try a bout ##ique hotel - The Ki ##nz ##ie . This is a dog friendly property styled with contemporary fur ##nish ##ing . The hotel staff is amazing and provided restaurant recommendations and made reservations on our behalf . Continental breakfast is served daily with an ass ##ort ##ment of past ##ries , bag ##els , cereal ##s , and fruit , along with tea and coffee . Car ##b intense - just what you need for a day of sight - seeing . Be warned - parking was a who ##pping $ 66 / day ! Hotel is within walking distance to several main attractions such as Michigan Avenue , Navy Pier , Willis Tower , and River Walk - very convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a business trip and had a mixed experience . Staff are very friendly and helpful . Bell ##man Eric is exceptional - Very energetic , pro ##active , and hard working . The hotel is undergoing construction and was very noisy . Staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting in moving me to another room but I don ’ t understand how they think they can continue to rent the rooms closest to construction . Noise level was really un ##bearable . Meeting venue downstairs was also very noisy with in ##cess ##ant loud drilling noises . [SEP]
0	[CLS] One of our favorite hotels in Chicago ! Friendly stuff , dogs friendly , nice decoration , clean , perfect location , comfortable king bed , we ' ve been to Chicago many of times before , this was our first stay in Monaco but definitely not the last one . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked here with my son as I needed something in downtown . This hotel is great location wise and facilities are nice too . The parking is is expensive but it ’ s the same everywhere so no issue for me . I was hoping they will give me free breakfast , but they did not have this option , but they gave me $ 30 credit towards a breakfast which is ok . The room was very nice and com ##fy beds . I will come back here again for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One night stay with friends from the U . K . Location is perfect for all the tourist things and shopping . Room ##s were perfect and Re ##ception staff were ok , though they managed to get our bills wrong . 20 minute walk to Navy Pier , and Mill ##eni ##um Park is 5 minutes from hotel . Hotel was hosting a conference so it was very busy , and restaurant had long wait , but there ’ s a breakfast place across the street and north , Egg ##y ’ s . It was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , service and amenities ( especially pool and gym ) are top notch . It was a perfect place to re ##ju ##ven ##ate between work and personal obligations . Every staff I interact ##ed with - cleaning team , con ##cier ##ge and front desk reception ##ists were all professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . For example , the con ##cier ##ge saved me lots of money and time by helping me figure out the most efficient transportation to a Chicago location out of downtown . Front desk team quickly corrected my bill when mini bar sensors were triggered when I used the mini f ##rig for personal food storage . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel has played host to a fair amount of American history . A short while after my stay I read Pat Buchanan ' s article re ##co ##unting his observations of the riot ##ers outside attempting to force their way into the Democratic National Convention fifty years prior . The hotel is huge and a fun novelty in that alone . However its size de ##tracts from its charm . The fitness center is excellent . The pool was at times too busy to be of interest . When we did visit the pool the other children there were polite and well behave ##d . Its location is hard to beat when visiting the museum campus My only complaints are that service from the con ##cier ##ge was surprisingly cu ##rt and the hotel charges a fee to store luggage after checking out , which is annoying immediately after settling a large hotel bill . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything about the P ##U ##BL ##IC is absolutely stunning . The interior is a perfect balance between modern and home ##y ; the white de ##cor and dim lighting create a feeling of luxury that carries throughout the entire hotel . We stayed here during the holiday season , and the roaring fireplace made the already co ##zy lobby even co ##zier . Sit ##uated in the Gold Coast neighborhood , P ##U ##BL ##IC is the perfect distance from all of the city ' s tourist ##y spots , but far enough away that the hotel feels nice and quiet . An amazing stay at a great value - we didn ' t want to leave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you do not expect much , just a regular hotel well located to the places you want to go , then it can be a ##cc ##ho ##ise , but do not raise your expectations too high , at least not as high as the price you get . Bell ##man very a ##rog ##ant . . . and when we entered hotel , there was bad d ##mell of old kitchen , old food or whatever . . . but really not nice smell I ' ve stored my luggage for half day after arrival . . . they have totally smashed my te ##xa ##s hat there . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was clean , well equipped and had very comfortable beds . The breakfast was excellent and cater ##ed for every taste . Waiting staff were extremely at ##ten ##tive and efficient . Having previously stayed at an inter ##continent ##al hotel , I wouldn ’ t choose any other for trips to the USA . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bed at the So ##fit ##el is amazing ##ly comfortable . Everything was beautiful , clean , modern and comfortable . It is Dog friendly . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located . We enjoyed a Ke ##uri ##g in the room and coffee downstairs in the morning ( a huge plus for us but so simple ) . No complaints ! We cannot wait to come back and stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I enjoyed a three day ’ s stay at the Fair ##mont Millennium Park in Chicago . We upgraded to the Gold level , and it was more than worth it ! All staff members and management were outstanding . And access to Mill ##eni ##um Park as well as the rest of downtown Chicago makes this a great place to stay when exploring the Wind ##y City . Thanks to all of you , and we are looking forward to our next visit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby area is amazing . But you can easily stop in for a drink without booking a stay . I enjoyed wandering the hotel and reading about the history . I did not however enjoy the small dirty room with no amenities . As in - no fridge , microwave , or un ##c ##log ##ged drain . There was a ball of hair on my bathroom floor and the stupid digital key didn ' t let me out of the garage . Not to mention a 10 - 15 minute elevator wait each time you want to go downstairs . I provided feedback to the staff and they responded with " I will send this to our ho ##usk ##eep ##ing managers . . . our a ##pologies " . Hotel is over ##rated . I stayed at the Drake two weeks later and enjoyed it tremendous ##ly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location of this hotel is wonderful , close to the river , restaurants , night life , easy walking distances . Check in was quick and simple , receive token ##s for drinks during happy hour , they also provide snack ##s . Nice to come back to the hotel and have this offered after walking all day . Room ##s and nice and clean , shower head you have two which are adjust ##able . Bed was a little harder then I like but I was able to sleep with no issues . I the morning they offer coffee / tea ##s and Breakfast items , helps to have while getting ready for your day and keeps cost down on one meal ! Over all I would stay here again for sure , no issues . Staff and door men very polite and helpful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were downtown for business and stayed here several days . Although the check in counter was too lightly staffed for the check in rush , our overall experience was great . The con ##cier ##ge , Maris ##a De Fe ##lice was outstanding and , on very short notice , helped us secure a table for 7 on a busy Saturday night at Vol ##are , a very nice and reasonably priced Italian restaurant just two blocks away . The city noise in this area can be loud , but our room windows looking out over the city were well ins ##ulated for sound and the rooms were quiet and the beds , very good . Yes , it is a busy , bust ##ling place , but the location can ' t be beat and the staff was positive , helpful and up ##beat . We will stay here for sure on our next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A nice hotel . The rooms are clean and Fresh and breakfast is served on every floor each morning . Whilst the b ##uff ##et isn ' t that amazing it ' s convenient and what is on offer is nice . Happy hour is offered which my partner and I attended . This was fun and the atmosphere really enjoyable . The location of the hotel like all Chicago hotels is great . Sur ##rou ##nded by great restaurants although the food at the hotel is great . The hotel use Harry Carey across the road so steak ##s and b ##urger ##s are amazing . I ' ve stayed here a number of times for work and really recommend it . The gym equipment is some of the best I ' ve ever used and I travel extensively . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a very nice , modern facility . Some of the " cool " technology could be a bit better thought out and a more usable spot for working in the room would have helped . The staff at this hotel are rock stars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal is a great property with a friendly staff . Bar is clean and well - managed . Great breakfast in Center Court . Pool is great , G ##ym needs some attention . Free bottle ##d water each day was nice . Coffee cups were NO ##T replaced and no wine glasses or glass ##ware except bathroom glasses by sink . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience with Douglas Pick ##et , Con ##cier ##ge , Nicole Les ##ia ##k , front desk and Ronald Johnson , bell ##man . These 3 individuals went above and beyond to make my stay as welcoming and comfortable as possible . I ’ ve stayed at this property for 15 years straight , and have had many experiences with the staff here at The Intercontinental , these 3 individuals made the difference . Ku ##dos Inter ##con ##t . For your amazing team , e ##as ##pec ##ially , Douglas , Nicole and Ronald ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a couple of nights , second time I have been here . Room very comfortable , hotel very convenient ##ly situated and wine hour in the lobby ( 5 - 6 ##pm ) is great . Free w ##if ##i , once you register ( if the registration form was a bit shorter that would be prefer ##able . . . . got a bit te ##dious filling in all the detail ) . O ##mel ##ette for breakfast very good . Staff very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dark and sexy ! Co ##m ##fort ##able beds and smaller rooms . The restaurant and bar are still not open which was a total b ##um ##mer . Park ##ing is very expensive so park across the street in the garage . The lock the door at 11 so you have to call to get back in the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] very close to the art institute - - du ##vet - - nice bed - - tiny wash ##room - - large sitting area good star ##bu ##cks - - excellent con ##cier ##ge - - - fine restaurant - - quite fancy furnishings no coffee maker - - - v ##alet parking [SEP]
0	[CLS] Last month , I was tasked with meeting with representatives of high profile companies in Chicago . I booked three rooms at the So ##fit ##el for my team and I . Our meeting went very well and a few of the members of upper management from the companies that we met with chose to join us for a drink at the hotel bar . I would soon learn that this was a mistake . I was through ##ly embarrassed as our choice of hotel became the butt of the jokes for the rest of the evening . The lobby and common areas were filthy . One of the members commented that they were insulted that we had taken them to the “ most g ##lor ##ified motel in Chicago . ” Luckily , I didn ’ t lose our partnership however I ’ ve learned to be much more careful in selecting my hotels ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and very helpful staff , B ##UT , would not recommend due to current very out ##dated condition of building . Room ##s are large and bright but in serious need of an upgrade . W ##if ##i included but only for two devices so if you log in with your phone or i ##pad your partner has no access . Su ##gg ##est prospective guests wait a few years and then give it a try once face ##lift is complete . Lots of potential . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have always enjoyed The O ##m ##ni Chicago . The location is excellent for exploring Michigan Avenue . The rooms are updated and clean . I feel that the American Girl Pack ##age was not as special as I had expected . Have stayed elsewhere with American Girl packages that were more much nice ##r . We b ##ave an issue with our parking charges , that I hope will be resolved . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suites in the hotel are very nice and spacious ; love the kitchen area . The room was very clean . The location of the hotel is great , in walking distance to everything , including the Navy Pier and massive amounts of shopping in every direction . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for a conference . This is a grand hotel with very comfortable and spacious rooms . The grand ball room is amazing . The gym is well stock ##ed and very functional . The conference space downstairs is ok and dated , but still functional . Great friendly staff . If you can afford it , great place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here in the heat of Chicago summer but Ki ##nz ##ie was cool ! We really liked getting few fun coins on arrival to buy wine at the hotel ' s free happy hour ! And the snack ##s were good as well , but make sure to arrive early because travelers can be a hungry lot ! ; ) The location was great , the Miracle Mile is within easy walking distance . We arrived on a Saturday evening , and the hood was rocking and the staff friendly . All in all , highly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel ! Everyone was very kind and nice ! Great location to everything ! We walked everywhere ! ! Breakfast was great ! ! Social dinner we only tried one night , they have it Mon - T ##hur ##s and it was good of what we had . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice and clean . Good card ##io equipment . A ##ble to charge Star ##bu ##cks to our room . Easy access to Chicago ' s train system that made going to W ##rig ##ley field simple and fast . Great location to Michigan a ##ve and Millennium Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Each day while shower ##ing at the Intercontinental , I would get the water temperature set in the shower and at various times while shower ##ing the water temperature would go from s ##cal ##ding hot to cold without adjusting the mixing valve . I had to move out of the water stream several times to avoid being burned . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located in an older brick type building , but everything upgraded and modern . Room ##s done very well and bar / restaurant / ll ##ou ##nge warm and welcoming . Friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Walking distance to Gibson ##s , Lou Mal ##nat ##is , Tavern on Rush . A couple of blocks to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our first downtown hotel stay since the pan ##de ##mic and it was very enjoyable . Had nice visits to a couple of the downtown museums . Vale ##t parking was not available but was OK since there was plenty of other parking within a block . This situation will pass as things get more normal . [SEP]
0	[CLS] On our third stay , we again found the quality of room and service at the Conrad Chicago outstanding . The customer service is extraordinary . The location is wonderful . The rooms are luxurious in a contemporary way . Stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When you enter and look at lobby it is beautifully done but guys wait don ' t keep your hope very high . They are just preparing you for the shock . The rooms r as small as a match stick box . If you open it luggage you can ' t even move in the room . And don ' t forget the bathroom . It is actually the size of bathroom in the plane . If u stay here your idea of holiday will totally van ##ish . P ##ls ##e . Think 100 times before staying here . The window glass r also broken . So my review is a b ##g NO NO . Go only if u want to stay in a k ##enne ##l . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love the So ##fit ##el in Chicago and always stay here . Whether i come once a month or every few months , the front desk recognizes me and always makes me feel welcome . The newly renovated rooms are gorgeous . We love Cafe des Artist ##es restaurant and also the Bar ! Great food and great am ##bian ##ce . And I haven ’ t even gotten to mention location It ’ s perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a couple of nights . The location is good . Room ##s are no f ##rill ##s - not even compliment ##ary water and basic . The bar is pretty good . The breakfast restaurant on ground floor is really not worth it and there was also a horrible waitress who seemed to be having a bad day and taking out on every one there . Hotel location is probably it ’ s best feature . Close to most things one needs in Chicago downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The entire experience was bad . Really bad . No room service . Limited other services because of the strike . They should had advised us when we booked . We travelled for 20 hours to get to Chicago and find out that the hotel staff was on strike and service will be limited . To make matters worse the lock on my door broke and it took 2 hours until they opened my room . Eventually I had to change room . Also be aware that check out is at 11 . 00 am . No check out later than 12 . 00 which is the standard time every where else in the world . Although I am a Hilton Honours member , I will not come back again . The staff was friendly and full of a ##pologies but that does not make up for the poor service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Its really clean , modern and ups ##cale . Its smaller so it feels like a nice bout ##ique hotel , yet it feels like it has the standard of an amazing high end large hotel chain . I was also surprised that we had a view overlooking a really cool outdoor patio . Its right next to amazing ups ##cale restaurants with outdoor patio ##s . This is a good hotel for tourism , business or anything ! They gave us big bottles of wine at check in so that was cool , too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed everything about this hotel . The staff are very friendly and welcoming and the location is very convenient to Michigan Avenue and the river . Everything at the hotel is very clean and well maintained . The rooms are very comfortable . This is a good hotel if you are coming to Chicago as a tourist to shop , eat and explore . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The experience from beginning to end is good . The v ##alet ##s are very nice and welcoming , the front desk personnel are friendly and the rooms are comfortable . I would eat at the restaurant bar each night after work and everything I ordered was good . Dr ##ink ##s are priced as you would expect at a hotel bar , a bit on the expensive side but the bar tender ##s are friendly and at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice and comfortable . Unfortunately the restaurant was not open ; however it is close enough to outside dining options . The underground system is convenient to get to the H ##ya ##tt where our conference was held . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is just okay . Room a little dirty . Bath ##room door that wouldn ' t shut . ( Maintenance did come fix it . ) I ' d only stay here again if it was a good deal because there plenty of other places to choose from for the same or less money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic experience at this hotel , a great location ( right on Michigan Ave ) and close to absolutely everything . The hotel bar / restaurant Michael Jordan ' s is great for a late night snack and drinks and a nice atmosphere . Nice additions like a computer with printer in lobby to print boarding passes , free re ##f ##resh ##ments , Star ##bu ##cks connected to hotel from lobby , con ##cier ##ge desk helpful , business office connected to a UP ##S store that you can access 24 h ##rs with your hotel card . All in all , can ' t find one fault , will stay here again for certain . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located comfortable home from home while in Chicago on Congress business . Suite ##s are large and air ##y and equipped with facilities for self catering including full size refrigerator , microwave with u ##tens ##ils and Ke ##uri ##g coffee machine . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was very impressed with this hotel ! The location is perfect since there are many restaurants nearby and it is a beautiful area . The staff was lovely and the room was spacious and comfortable . The best part was the heat ##er in the bathroom ! I stay at many hotels and have yet to find one with a heat ##er . I hope to stay here from now on when I have to visit Chicago for my work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Mass ##ive , perfectly appointed rooms . Good compliment ##ary internet . Would be good to let you know if you can get milk for coffee in room . Would be nice if mirror in bedroom was better ( lighting of mirror and ability to stand further away from mirror - was just in the hallway ) . Breakfast was ta ##sty but service was a little spot ##ty - didn ' t ask if you wanted juice , what kind of coffee you wanted , and needed reminding about juice orders etc . Great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the 2nd Kim ##pton Hotel I have stayed at and will certainly stay here or look for another Kim ##pton Hotel in the future . The de ##cor in the main reception area is beautiful and the rooms are extremely spacious , well designed and furnished to a high standard . The staff were helpful and friendly . The location in central Chicago is perfect for a weekend break or longer stay . Nearby shops and tourist attractions are just steps away . Lots of bars and restaurants within the vicinity too . A great place to stay and cannot wait to return . Super comfortable beds ensure a lovely nights sleep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel knows you want a room with a view . Our standard king on 26th floor faced the lake , Navy Pier and the buildings around . Has the Palm restaurant and an informal bi ##stro area . Walking distance to Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I picked this hotel for the reasonable price and free W ##i - Fi , although to get the W ##i - Fi I had to sign up to their rewards scheme . ( Another un ##su ##bs ##cribe to action shortly ! ) If coming from O ' Hare , it ' s easy as the hotel is close to Clark / Lake on the Blue line which is direct from the airport . It ' s also walking distance to Sears Tower and the Museums , but depends how much you like walking . I didn ' t really like this hotel , noise carried far too much internally and I could hear people in the next room when they were talking at normal volume . Lots of water noises from shower ##s , toilets etc also and I got the feeling it was an old ##ish hotel that was showing its age . I don ' t think I would stay here again based on this experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was an exceptional experience with the hotel and staff . Tony in con ##cier ##ge was sensation ##al . . The staff was friendly , my room had a great view overlooking the Lake . the location of the hotel was perfect . Walking distance to everywhere . It was a perfect experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our trip to Chicago was really nice , and the Conrad Hotel was one of the best Hotel stays that I have ever had ! We were close to everything , and we felt very safe the entire trip ! The rooms are very modern with a large TV , and automated blind ##s and lights . It is a great place to stay if you can afford it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We couldn ' t get out of O ' Hare so dashed into Chicago during recent Historic 2 Day Cold Wave . Very few guests at property , but Hotel staff that was able to get to work were all outstanding & at ##ten ##tive . They made our un ##p ##lan ##ned stay so very memorable . Will return for a planned stay during warmer days ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed 2 nights in this hotel . The last day there was no TV signal and the telephone ( to complain about the TV ) was out of order . Also a lamp was failing . All in a 460 dollars per night suite . And the management did not give an ad ##ec ##uate respond . Not the I ##C ' s standards . During 2018 I ' ve been in another I ##C Hotel ' s . . . NY , London and Paris . The Intercontinental Chicago Miracle Mile is in a different league in com ##par ##ision with other properties of the group . One last observation : when the Ambassador program promises " in room mineral water " , the guest don ' t expect to visit daily the front desk and ask for water . Of course the compliment ##ary pay TV film and daily newspaper is a joke at Chicago ' s Intercontinental . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a room at She ##rato ##n Grand for our 44 ##th wedding anniversary . As we were driving into Chicago I noticed their rate had gone from $ 145 to $ 108 , but thought that ’ s ok , we will enjoy the night . However when we went to get our car out of self park , we could barely get our vehicle out , the exits were poorly marked and it cost & 55 . 00 to SE ##LF PA ##R ##K ! When I called customer services they were not helpful at all ! Buy ##er Be ##ware when thinking you are going to get compliment ##ary parking when staying in Chicago . We will not return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a last minute reservation for the annual RS ##NA meeting . Typically a hotel of this class would cost $ 250 - $ 300 per night . One week before the meeting the cost was less than $ 200 . While the hotel is a little out ##dated , it offers great value and an excellent location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Te ##rrible hotel . V ##ent ##ilation in room did not work . I left early , and they assured me they would charge only for four nights , but they charged me for seven . Tri ##ed to straight ##en it out , including with their corporate HQ , and nothing happened . Also over ##charged for the room . D ##O NO ##T ST ##A ##Y H ##ER ##E . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The location was perfect , you could walk to any of the attractions and the personnel was very at ##ten ##tive to our needs . The food and the service at the restaurant was excellent . If I go back to Chicago i would go to Hotel Monaco Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] For our 50th anniversary , we chose the Fair ##mont in Chicago . The room was lovely and had te ##rri ##fic views of the city . It is easy walking distance to many of the attractions in Chicago . And they readily hail a cab for transportation . We liked the breakfast served in the morning . Man ##don ##a helped us become acquainted with the dishes of the morning . When we have stayed at the Fair ##mont before , Man ##don ##a was there , helpful and friendly . So very happy with the Fair ##mont in Chicago . We ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great value . Perfect location . It allowed us to go to restaurants , see me ##su ##ums and visit the suburbs as needed . Room was good . Some common areas could use a face lift but all were well kept . That would be the difference for getting 5 stars [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay at this well located Chicago hotel . Service was excellent and the staff were all very court ##eous . The rooms were clean and quiet ( which made for a good night of sleep ) . Overall , a well maintained facility . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for business , but I want to come back with my husband . The hotel was beautiful , rooms very nice , amazing views ! The location was perfect , near the river for a cruise , 5 minutes walking to Mill ##eni ##um Park . Can ' t wait to go back to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My first trip to Chicago and i made the perfect choice . excellent location and amazing views . of ##course i got the best room due to being frequent h ##ya ##tt guest . The restaurant at ground level has very friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for three nights celebrating both my birthday and our 25th wedding anniversary . We were given a great room and a bottle of wine from the management . Drake gave above and beyond service , but all staff at front desk , house ##keeping and breakfast friendly and kind . Breakfast was fine , a big selection , and rooms were lovely , large and clean with very comfortable bed and furniture and lovely bathroom ##s and de ##cor . Thanks for a truly te ##rri ##fic stay ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] J ##ac ##lyn Costello went above and beyond for me and my family . Stay ##ed here during a holiday and the hotel was pretty empty , so she decided to upgrade our rooms , send my dad champagne , and made our stay one of the best . De ##fin ##ite ##ly deserve a 5 - star review , and will be staying again next time in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The good is the hotel is magnificent . The room looks very nice and is modern . Room had separate tub and shower , room ##y bathroom with emergency call phone . Park ##ing is complicated . The next door public parking is difficult to locate your parked car or to know where you are when you exit the building . Public parking is price ##y at $ 45 a day . Vale ##t parking is also price ##y at $ 78 a day . As with most price ##y hotels , this one does not have a microwave or refrigerator . Great elevator security . Mini bar is price ##y . Internet is $ 10 a day . Room service is price ##y . At night Chicago weather went down to 55 degrees and the heat controls worked in the room ; some hotels turn off the heat controls . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here many times , it ' s great ! Room ##s have great city and lake views , staff is excellent , location in town is perfect . Fitness center is pretty good for a hotel and like 50 stories up ! Everything is great here ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt Regency is perfectly located and most rooms provide great views . Staff is very helpful and friendly . Lou ##d neighbors woke us at 1 : 30 am - I was surprised the door didn ' t mute them more . But all hotels likely have that issue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff were excellent , beds were comfortable and the rooms were quiet . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly situated walking distance from most tourist attractions . The fridge ##s actually have nothing in them to store your own goods . Doesn ’ t happen much in the USA . Will be back someday . A great hotel in a Great city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful visit to one of our favorite cities ! There was a little trouble na ##vi ##gating the construction & getting to the hotel but Roll ##o was an amazing help ! He expert ##ly talked us through it & kept us on the phone until he saw us pull into the hotel . Such awesome service from check - in to check - out . This is our 2nd stay here & we ' ll definitely be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I did get a mid ##win ##ter special so the value was te ##rri ##fic ; but I R ##EA ##LL ##Y like the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . It is a mile away from the Art Institute ; close to the magic mile , a 30 min . walk to Lincoln Park - - Anyway , you get it - - location location location . - - Our King room was very spacious with a com ##fy couch . Free W ##if ##i was actually good ! Water pressure excellent . Quiet . They have this great happy hour with simple ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres and a free drink if you book through them - - and I love that in the morning you can just walk a few steps outside your room and there are coffee and m ##uff ##ins , fruit etc . They also had ch ##amo ##mile tea in the lobby when we arrived . These little extra ##s are te ##rri ##fic when all the basic ##s are also top notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the hotel ! Perfect location in The Gold Coast of Chicago . The staff was great and friendly and the room was very comfortable and clean . Travis at the front desk was so sweet and helpful and made us feel very welcome during our stay . We had great cocktail ##s and a chat with the bartender . She was a riot ! All in all an amazing first real vacation to Chicago . De ##fit ##ely staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome customer service ! ! Love ! ! See John the bell ##hop . He will make whatever you need happen quick and easy ! Room service very expensive ! ! Be careful ! ! All amenities and services were great . Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! ! River ##walk is beautiful . Near everything within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed the Conrad for a weekend away with my wife . Had pre ##arra ##nged straw ##berries and wine which were ready upon arrival and delicious . The room was luxurious and comfortable . The bed really nice . Beat of all the food at the restaurant was phenomena ##l . The staff was really friendly and helpful . De ##fin ##ite ##ly 5 star . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby area deserves special praise , think grand central and you will get an idea . Con ##cier ##ge were very helpful . The room was quite awful , hip and historic room should be renamed d ##rab and dirty . The room could have been scrub ##bed but still wouldn ’ t have made it look clean . Peel ##ing wall ##paper , cracked sink , trim missing and m ##ou ##ld by soap tray . You really are just paying for the history of the building , needs a re ##va ##mp ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was OK for one person , view of ugly building right next to it . My issue is the hotel charges a night ##ly service fee of $ 15 which they did not mention when I checked in nor was it mentioned in the re ##ceipt when I paid booking on - line . At time of check - out , I was informed that my payment did not include their night ##ly service charge of $ 15 . They should tell guests that in advance . V ##ER ##Y SL ##EA ##Z ##Y on their part . Would not do business with them again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Each year we come for our girls weekend and love staying at The Intercontinental . We feel spoiled from the time we arrive until the time we leave . Clive is a regular and always makes our trip extra special ! A self ##ie with him was a must ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay at the Conrad and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay . The staff at the entry level and at the check in were outstanding ! I loved that you check in on a top floor - amazing views . Our room was very clean and had a great view . We were given an upgrade upon arrival - thank you . We love this hotel and we can ' t wait to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location in Chicago . Very friendly staff . Nice clean room . Love ##d the nice firm beds and pillows . I was disappointed not to have a room fridge . I had a nice dinner out on the town , brought left ##overs back to my room to eat the following morning for breakfast , but I had to throw the food away because the room did not have a fridge . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I wanted a weekend away . The architecture of the So ##fit ##el always amazed me . I went to the hotel website and made sure that the fitness facility was high quality as exercise is important to me . When I arrived at the hotel , I went to the gym . I was directed to a small room that had a few pieces , think Hampton Inn . This is not a 5 star gym . The hotel should have said that it ' s gym was not functional and an alternative place should have been offered . I left after the first night and switched to another property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m a Hilton Diamond member and frequently travel , yet this was my first stay in a Conrad . So lovely . So fresh . So p ##rist ##ine . What can I say . . . great intention had been paid to every . single . detail . in . my . room . Everything about the room was subtle , yet incredibly . . . re ##son ##ant . Great energy . Nice ##ly down , Conrad . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Kim ##pton All ##egro is a beautiful hotel . The lobby is f ##abulous . En ##joy ##ed our room - the staff was very friendly . Josh was super helpful and he helped make our short stay very enjoyable . Coffee in the morning n the lobby was pleasant and lots of choices [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was elegant , modern , co ##zy and big enough . The bed was very comfortable and the bed ##ding as well . Our arrival went smooth . We had a nice view from the hotel ( we were at the 29th floor ) . The location is just perfect , 6 minutes walk from the subway station . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve never stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l before , but it was a wonderful experience . One of the best I ' ve ever had . From the moment me and travel partner pulled we were greeted with real warm smiles and assistance . Everyone . . . and I do mean E ##VE ##R ##Y ##ON ##E treated us with R ##ES ##P ##EC ##T . . . see , we ' re from Detroit and Ms . Are ##tha Franklin told us all , we should expect it . . . . AND W ##E GO ##T IT . Our room was excellent ##ly clean with a wonderful view of the Chicago River and Ferris Wheel at The Navy Pier . The bed and pillows were super com ##fy and House ##ke ##ep was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Thank you Swiss ##ote ##l for making our Chicago Adventure an exceptionally fun trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able Bed and extremely large Room with a 70 inch television . . . . The Staff was remarkably polite and helpful , from house ##keeping to the Con ##cier ##ge to the Bart ##ender . . . . . If you are traveling to Chicago and plan on visiting Rush street or the Ma ##g Mile this is a great choice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in excellent location in the heart of Chicago . 1 block of the subway so easy access to anywhere in the city . Came with my family to see a Cubs game and celebrate my birthday . Go Cubs ! The hotel was like our home away from home . Great breakfast to start off each day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel for a conference in November . Beautiful , well maintained and very friendly and helpful staff . All of the front desk people that I encountered were helpful and cheerful . I had an especially nice conversation with O ##bed ##die Hawkins , a director , who gave us excellent advice on restaurants and transportation in the area . As a proud Chicago native he was very happy to share his city with us , and his advice was spot on . The only warning I would have is that there are not enough elevators , so you may want to ask for a lower floor that is walk ##able . During breaks in the conference the lines to go up and down were very long . Thanks for a great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No hot water Under some construction didn ’ t tell us super noisy No phone so no room service The worst part is that they didn ’ t say anything not even sorry Very disappointing And we pay like it was 5 stars [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was clean , staff friendly , parking fee is price ##y . The breakfast food and area was clean and good . Just wish it ' s more ve ##get ##arian options offered . En ##joy ##ed the stay despite the heavy traffic downtown ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t on an overnight girls shopping trip to Chicago . We took the Amtrak from Michigan and arrived at 9 ##am . We were able to check in by noon and it was helpful due to hauling light luggage with us . Staff was helpful and friendly . As 2 women alone in Chicago and walking to all our destinations , we felt safe traveling from our hotel to Michigan Ave . I would return to Home ##wood Suite ##s in the future for another overnight stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great downtown location with the river ##walk , Navy Pier , business district , shopping all very accessible by foot . The staff were lovely and happy to assist , but I ’ m not sure if they were under ##sta ##ffed and at capacity with 4 July celebrations as laundry pick up , room service removal and check out , all required quite lengthy waits . The hotel itself is older , and the rooms quite dated , the bathroom especially so . My six night stay was okay , but not spectacular . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were on our way to meet up with family in N ##D , and stopped in Chicago on our first day . We love the Kim ##pton properties they are always great places , and hotel Monaco didn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . The staff was fantastic , very friendly , and knowledge ##able . They were also very helpful helping us get our dogs comfortable . The only reason I didn ' t score a 5th star is because out of the 2 elevators they had , one wasn ' t working : ( [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a super friendly hotel in downtown . Lots of theatres and restaurants nearby . Breakfast is included and it is really nice . We were given a free upgrade which was appreciated . The linen and towels were lovely . The staff were very friendly . I loved the art on the walls and the horse above the entrance . I will be making this my regular stop . You can also get take out from the restaurant next door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able , very clean , friendly staff , amazing location ! It was wonderful to come back to this property after long days touring the city . It ’ s in the heart of the city but very quiet . I will recommend this hotel and this city to everyone and will definitely stay there again on a future trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , te ##rri ##fic service , great location , great bar and restaurant , my favorite Chicago business hotel . I like the layout with the lobby on the 20th floor adjacent to the restaurant , great view , feels special , rooms are excellent , electric d ##rap ##es and other features are appreciated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When you walk in the front desk treats you well . You pass the bikes you can borrow to go go around town . The rooms are size ##able - plenty of room to spread out . If you do the K ##har ##ma program , you get to " raid the mini bar " which is fun and w ##if ##i is free with your email address only . Great amenities in the room including a yoga mat . Really cool and comfortable room . The restaurant and bar downstairs is great . What makes it is the service . The bartender was making every feel like locals . Almost like you walked into his establishment . I stay a couple days . The breakfast is great - comes out fast . Service is just as good . No pressure , just smart people that know how to take great care of their customers . Best service in a Kim ##pton property that I ' ve been to so far . Ch ##eers , [SEP]
1	[CLS] We Would highly recommend this hotel as the the staff , more specifically D ##wayne and Percy with Guest Services were exceptionally awesome ! They gave great recommendations and made our experience in Chicago un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble . Ask them for ka ##ra ##oke and speak ##eas ##y re ##cco ##s around the city ! The Talbot is located in a prime location for visitors in the highly prestigious neighborhood of the Gold Coast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed one night at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel and the staff were superb ! Lauren checked me in and remembered me each time I passed through the lobby . George gave excellent service and helped me with some questions . Even the General Manager Andrew was extremely helpful when I left my credit card at the neighboring restaurant . I stayed in a beautiful suite and couldn ' t ask for a better stay in Chicago ! I will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The old and famous hotel in downtown Chicago , near the Michigan Avenue ( Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ) , with excellent location for walking to points of interest , including Mill ##eni ##um Park ! Warning : the price for v ##alet service is very expensive ( $ 67 . 00 / day ) ! Su ##gg ##est ##ion : put your car in parking place front the hotel ( $ 42 . 00 / day ) ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visit Chicago 15 - 20 weeks of the year and the Conrad has become a firm favourite . Central ##ly located on Michigan Ave the city is quite literally on your front door . Despite the proximity of the Michigan mile every room I have stayed in has been quiet , incredibly comfortable and the automatic black out blind ##s keep the city at arms length . The hotel offers three restaurants at ground level , 20th and roof top depending on your mood . Breakfast and dinner is always exceptional with great choice and quality making it hard to venture any further a ##field . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A huge 3 , 000 guest rooms hotel , en ##tral location , si ##zable rooms and efficient service . Although this hotel is rather old , it provides a pleasant guest experience . The gym is spacious and well equipped . Located on the river , a short walking distance from Chicago ’ s Architecture Center , the loop and magnificent mile on Michigan Avenue . There ’ s even an underground p ##ed ##way connection to downtown - very useful on snow ##y / rainy / cold days . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At the Swiss ##H ##ote ##l for one week ##night . Noel @ the v ##alet hooked me up with a great bar / restaurant for the night — Exactly what I was looking for . This guy knows the spots in town . Great guy ! Hit him up if you ’ re here and want a good spot for the night . [SEP]

1	[CLS] A great place for a little bit of a g ##lam trip . Great location and excellent service . I travel about 40 weeks a year , mostly on business and although I stay at many high quality properties , the Conrad separated from the group based upon it ' s level of service . A ##cc ##ept the p ##amp ##ering ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What an amazing stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago . From the moment we checked in we felt special . The bed oh so comfortable , the small amenities supplied , and my wife loved the Her ##mes s ##ham ##po ##o , condition , lot ##ion , soap , and bath gel . Every person we came across was very friendly and helpful . Great location , great staff , and great room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was comfortable , quiet , and central ##ly located in downtown Chicago . The room with a king size single bed very room ##y . It also has a great little bar and restaurant with plenty of windows . I enjoyed my stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our hotel at the Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago was great ! The lobby was beautiful , with friendly staff and social di ##stan ##cing rules in place . The view of the river from my room was also stunning ! Great fitness center with a wide range of machines and cool view of the city . Great location downtown , easy to site - see and get around . Would recommend ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Hotel is in an ideal area of Chicago . From the minute we checked in to the free around the town car . We had a fantastic trip . Thanks to Esther , Val ##da , Marcus and Melissa for making our trip so memorable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] make sure you check your bill ##ing before leaving the hotel , you might get home and find charges on your card that you have no idea what it ' s to . No re ##ceipt email ##ed ! Room ##s were very nice and view was amazing . Walking distance to a lot of sites ! Better sign ##age to indicate where you drive up to to check in and v ##alet your vehicle . We enjoyed the short time we had to enjoy the stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I try to stay at the kin ##zie hotel whenever I come to Chicago . First , the rooms are very comfortable , and although there ' s a bit of street noise it ' s nothing that gets in the way of a good night ' s sleep . Second there is a free continental breakfast and a happy hour . You are smack in the middle of Chicago - walk to the loop , tons of restaurants at night , and close to the river for a walk or a run . Finally the staff is un ##fa ##iling ##ly polite . I certainly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location , perfect for seeing the sights in Chicago . We spent a week here and found great restaurants in walking distance . Love ##d being close the the River - Walk . Our room was spot ##lessly clean and the bed was comfortable . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed in a few hotels like this and can honestly say that this is so far tops . Was welcomed with a lovely b ##ub ##bly smile ##y reception ##ist on arrival ( and friendly door staff ) . Was made to feel welcome and comfortable before getting to the room . Got the style of room requested and was truly satisfied . Had 1 or 2 things to change in room but that was no bother to the member of staff . Bed was comfortable and had no problems getting to sleep . P ##lent ##y of room to sit and chill in when coming back to the room . Breakfast was enjoyable with a large selection and different options each morning . Wen ##t to the welcome evening and the selection of food was enough for a meal or a snack before going out . Overall the staff were very friendly from the door to the house keeping staff . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Was in Chicago for work and had a great time . Love the city and the O ##m ##ni was wonderful . The rooms were clean and it was just like a home away from home feel to it . I highly suggest this hotel . Next time in Chicago I will surely go to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice location but come on . . . you ' ve got to update these rooms ! They ' re so old . Need a bigger gym . . . you have a conference here and it ' s so busy it ' s almost dangerous in there it ' s so crowded . Put hand sa ##ni ##ti ##zer in the gym please . Seriously . . . UP ##DA ##TE THE ##SE R ##O ##OM ##S ! S ##pen ##d the money . Stay competitive in the Chicago market . There ' s no excuse for this . I ' d only stay here again for a G ##RE ##AT rate . Otherwise I might pay up for a nice ##r room and gym . . . depends on my length of stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great hotel to stay at when visiting Chicago Downtown . Very easily accessible and clean atmosphere . The hotel is very busy most of the time so early check in probably won ' t be possible so plan your arrival accordingly . The Hilton Chicago on Michigan Ave is wonderful and would definitely stay here every time I visit Chicago ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel overall . Clean rooms . Excellent friendly staff especially Paula N at check in . I ##H ##G members are treated very well . Location can ’ t be better right near ma ##g mile and W ##ack ##er . Historic building in that is still modern inside especially rooms . Only problem is the fancy feather blanket in rooms it is c ##lump ##y and uncomfortable . Strip ##ped and re ##made bed just use a fancy synthetic one [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was clean and in decent repair but not great . Bath ##room re ##ek ##ed of marijuana when we returned to the room after being out for the day . After paying all taxes and fees in advance with our booking , a $ 15 / night service fee appeared which we were told was to cover the " compliment ##ary " breakfast . Overall bad experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk staff and team is always so helpful and happy ! Dan made my solo surprise trip to ch ##ica ##go very special and arrangements at a near by lounge for our girls X ##mas party made easier with their assistance ! Success ##ful trip due to location and Ki ##nz ##ie team ! Back soon ! Thank you ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are very spacious and clean . Great location . Staff friendly and helpful . Most rooms have a great view of Chicago - - mine overlooked the Chicago River and the old W ##rig ##ley building . The right size for amenities and getting around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] my partner and I stayed for our last night on a road trip . hotel in great location . room a good size . clean , bathroom clean . great iron ##ing facilities , hair ##dr ##yer and tea and co ##ffe facilities . views from room fantastic . the only thing was on check , hotel was busy with guests waiting to do this . may an hour early on a 2 ##pm sun ##day , we were given the choice or upgrade at a cost . I imagine all of the the other guests were offered this . around 3 ##pm I asked was the room ready it was . we had sat in hotel one hour now , we had given phone number to contact us , which they didn ' t . I feel maybe they say this hoping some quest ##s will upgrade . anyway overall stay good . would recommend to friends and family when visiting Chicago , mainly for the v ##ies and location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I originally booked the Ken ##zie when I seen a price drop on Trip advisor . I stayed at the Am ##al ##fi ( now the Ki ##nz ##ie ) a couple times and they were great stays . The hotel is top notch , the night ##ly reception is a great way to start the night with a big ass ##ort ##ment of meat ##s , cheese , drinks and snack ##s . The breakfast at the elevator is p ##lent ##iful with juice ##s , don ##uts , cereal ##s , boiled egg ##ed , yo ##gu ##rt , all beverages . Everyone there makes you feel welcome in a beautiful hotel . I definitely will be staying with them . It is the perfect location 2 blocks off Ma ##g mile and loop . It was a very easy walk from theater . . Perfect ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic experience in this Hotel . A fantastic view on Chicago sky ##kin ##e and Lake view . Hotel is in Centre of Chicago just to achieve every interesting point All people very kind and very big and con ##fort ##able room Clean Excellent International breakfast [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice looking high rise near sea ##rs tower in a nice neighbourhood . Good rooms and co ##zy bar with good cocktail ##s . Breakfast was not included and you have to order . There is no b ##uff ##et . Quick check in . Ask for a room on a high floor with sea ##rs tower view [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , service oriented staff , clean rooms and plus ##h bed ##ding . What more could you want ? Always look forward to staying here . Been here several times for business , and would definitely come back with family for vacation [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel ' s architecture and de ##cor reflect modern aesthetics without sa ##c ##ri ##fic ##ing comfort . A pleasure to observe and enjoy . Front desk staff bent over backwards to enhance my happiness . The redesigned fitness center is state of the art and large enough to accommodate a crowd with no waiting . The bar is an inviting environment to social ##ize or watch a game and the original cocktail ##s are as delight ##ful as they are eccentric . My stay was totally satisfying . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Average property in great location . No pool and no late night room service left it lacking . Only one restaurant on site , lounge was only open s ##poradic ##ally . It just didn ' t live up to the Fair ##mont brand on all levels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay in Chicago was made all the more pleasant by our hotel . Location was fantastic for all activities in the downtown area . We always appreciate a suite because it gives us some space to separate ourselves from the bedroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was able to check in early on the day we arrived and we were pleased with the comfort and look of the room . Everything was clean and the overall service was great - particularly Dan at the front desk who was super helpful . Continental breakfast was a great set up - bring everything back to the room in the morning . Manager ' s reception was also a great touch . Only draw ##back is the noise in the rooms , both from the street and the neighboring guests . Will definitely return the next time we ' re in town . The location is perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is the most comfortable , and elegant place to stay . We enjoyed as much time here as our visit allowed . Staff was all very helpful . I wish we could have stayed long enough to arrange a visit to the Archive Room . We did not eat at the restaurant , but the Star ##bu ##cks is handy , and there are some nearby eat ##eries which we enjoyed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel is located at 20 E . Delaware Place , just off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It has a lovely outdoor cafe and is walking distance to great shopping , the Chicago Water Tower , and numerous charming restaurants and evening night ##life venues . The hotel has been recently renovated and is now operated under the H ##ya ##tt umbrella . The rooms for our get ##away for five ladies were perfectly appointed , and the reservations team did a great job of getting our rooms all on the same floor . All of the staff members we encountered were extremely friendly and knowledge ##able and the Con ##cier ##ge recommended the ideal restaurant for our special birthday br ##unch . We could not have picked a more wonderful hotel for this special weekend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service very friendly , with wonderful attention to detail . Clean , quiet rooms . A ##vo ##id the mini - bar , which is over ##p ##rice ##d . Location great for restaurants . Hotel restaurant nicely decorated , but food a bit heavy on rich pork products . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had an amazing stay , super friendly staff and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Will be back and will recommend to family and friends . The views from the 30th floor were amazing . I stayed at the prestige suite and everything was just amazing [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over the years , we have stayed at several highly rated hotels and resorts , one of them being the Le ##B ##lan ##c in Can ##cu ##n . The am ##bian ##ce , service , room quality and staff at the So ##fit ##el were equal to the Le ##B ##lan ##c . Our room was beautifully appointed . We liked the contemporary but warm and inviting d ##é ##cor of the room as well as the public spaces , especially the elevator lo ##bb ##ies . We felt we got our money ' s worth and would definitely stay at the So ##fit ##el if the opportunity arises again . The only problem we had was that due to an incorrect cancel ##ation and the reins ##tate ##ment of our booking , we were charged twice for our stay . Michael , one of the front desk managers took care of the problem with no f ##uss . We really appreciated the way he handled and resolved the problem . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for multiple nights . Hotel and accommodation ##s were very clean , quiet , well kept , updated and comfortable . The staff without exception were all very professional , efficient , polite and helpful . The location is great for transit , near many nice restaurants and shopping . The fitness center is very well equipped with newer machines and was also very clean . I would recommend this to anyone - one night or multiple nights . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I returned to the All ##egro for the first time in a number of years - - this time for a romantic weekend rather than business . I ' ve stayed at many Chicago hotels over the years , but I was delighted to find that the All ##egro remains my favorite . The hotel ' s design and art de ##co de ##cor is simply beautiful . The staff is remarkably court ##eous , knowledge ##able and welcoming . And the " happy hour " with complementary wine for guests is a perfect way to relax and , if you choose , meet some of the fascinating people who you find at the All ##egro . NO ##TE : W ##i - Fi is free if you are member of the hotel ' s loyalty program ( free sign up ) . Could not give the hotel and its staff a higher rating . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A really great hotel in a brilliant location - close to the river , the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , restaurants , bars and the subway . Room ##s are spacious , very comfortable and not expensive . Hotel offers a free wine or beer and snack ##s each evening as well as a hot drink in the lobby in the afternoon . Staff are super friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location for visiting the city , but . . . . We stayed a couple of nights back in July . We arrived , two people , with 6 pieces of luggage . Outside on the street , several hotel staff members , at least four , just turned their faces , ignored us completely and kept chatting while we struggled back and forth to carry the luggage to the elevator . Back home , a few days later I realized I had lost my I ##phone head ##phones , most probably I left them in the hot ##em room . I sent an e - mail asking to kindly check whether the head ##phones had been found , but no reply . Sen ##t it again , still no reply . In general , not a good service for a hotel this level . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been traveling all over USA and all over the world for many years . Stay ##ing in this hotel is the worst nightmare I ever had . No refrigerator , no pot to b ##oil water , no plastic liner for trash bin , missing bath towels . The desk are chip ##ped and dirty . The nightstand is dirty . The hotel garage location is very difficult to find , the only house keeping we received today is bath towels changed . Although the location is excellent . I will never come back . What a shame . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s and service . High ##ly recommend the breakfast : ma ##gni ##fi ##que . It is right on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , which makes it easy to access all the nice ##r things Chicago has to offer . Great con ##cier ##ge service too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked here last minute , thinking we were getting a good value . The pictures looked great . Our first concern was all the police cars out front . The lobby had seen better days . The person checking in before us had their credit card declined . I ' m guessing that ' s not unusual . They didn ' t have the king bed we booked and instead gave us two double beds . There was also a sign telling you they add a $ 15 facility fee . Upon entering our room , we noticed black mold on the ceiling , holes in the rug and no extra lock other than the one controlled by the key card . We moved a chair in front of the door . Couldn ' t get back on the road fast enough in the morning . Great location but that ' s it . Not sure how this hotel has the rating it does . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly old hotel . . . . but not very pleasant when the room AC is stuck at 65 degrees . In ##formed hotel maintenance who " fixed " problem but admitted it would take hours for the room to warm . Was not offered another room with a working H ##VA ##C system . S ##le ##pt with a couple of layers to stay warm when it was 80 + degrees outside . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The bride picked this as her base for the wedding so all the bride ##sma ##ids and family stayed here and we were treated like royalty . From check in to check out we were p ##amp ##ered , taken care of and generally loved to death . The happy hour and breakfast b ##uff ##ets were fun and appreciated . And the rooms were sound ##proof and large . We will definitely stay here again - even without the bride ! ! Well done , Ki ##nz ##ie ! And special thanks to Victor who helped me get through a couple of rough patches ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel allows check - in online , although you still have to show a credit card and ID to get a key . There is a happy hour 5 - 8 with two free drinks and app ##eti ##zers from 5 - 7 . There is room service from a local restaurant with good choices that are not too expensive . Internet for all devices is free . There is breakfast on each floor in the morning and coffee / tea in the room . My room had a king bed , couch , flat screen TV , large bathroom with a lot of counter space and several towels . The hotel overall is very modern and taste ##fully decorated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the 5th stay for us . Their prices are reasonable and that along with easy check - in and a room that suits our purpose , ( shopping ) keeps us coming back . The rooms are on the small ##ish side but they have great beds and ups ##cale bathroom ##s . The hotel is located very close to the ma ##g mile shopping and has a bar in the lobby to re ##f ##resh us during a mid day rest from our shopping . The service at the front door has always been great too . My wife and I will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff are top notch . The location is fantastic . When traveling to Chicago I always look here first . I utilize all parts of the hotel from fitness to Le bar to the Cafe . It ' s all fantastic . Stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here on a business trip and the hotel is nice but not great . The rooms require some up ##dating , carpet ##s are old and have an o ##do ##ur to them . The view is nice and the food at the conference was good as well , staff is friendly and helpful . I would just expect a cleaner environment for the cost of the rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] . . . in Chicago after a busy week . A ##rri ##ved Thursday evening , very friendly and professional welcome . I got a nice , clean and generous room on the 20th floor . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed and a enough space to work . The Hotel is perfect located and you can reach everything in walking distance . Be prepared as the wind ##y City is really wind ##y and when it ' s cold . . . . you need to wear warm clothes . The rooms are slightly out ##dated and doesn ' t reflect anymore today ##s expectations . But a nice Hotel at a perfect location to explorer the wind ##y City Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time in Chicago , stayed at the O ##m ##ni on business . Excellent location . King suite very nicely decorated with all the amenities I needed . Originally given a room on the 18th floor near the elevator and ice machine . Wen ##t back to reception and was switched to another room , no problem . Then Nikki called me in my new room to make sure I liked it . Nice touch . Conference space was nice , food and snack ##s were excellent . Bottom line , I ' d go back again in a heartbeat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay at this hotel for weekend trips to Chicago all the time ! ! Close to all of the fun spots downtown . Staff is great ! ! If you ' re looking for a recommendation for a night out , ask John the door ##man ! Always has a smile and great suggestions ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My two daughters and I really enjoyed our overnight shopping trip . We stayed in a king suite that included a sleep ##er sofa . I opted to have v ##alet parking and a b ##uff ##et breakfast included in the room price . The breakfast was fantastic , our server was kind enough to let us know if we wanted pan ##cakes , wa ##ffles or o ##at ##me ##al , he would have it made for us . The location was right in the middle of all of our favorite stores . I especially enjoyed the in and out privileges with v ##alet parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So the experience started out great , was able to check in a bit early and the check - in desk let me borrow her personal phone charge ##r since I forgot mine and had a call . As with all Kim ##pton ' s they give you a card for a compliment ##ary drink and they have a compliment ##ary wine Happy Hour . The rooms are a bit tiny and the property is a very old building , its renovated but still a little q ##ui ##rky . I didn ' t love carrying a bulk ##y key everywhere . Bed is very comfortable and has a nice size flat screen . The hotel is very convenient to shopping , restaurants , Grant park and the loop . Perfect for the mix between business trip and a little tourism [SEP]
1	[CLS] My girls friends and I through ##ly enjoyed our weekend at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . The a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s were clean , modern and comfortable . The staff was very helpful , friendly , and eager to assist you with almost anything . Great Location on a fun street ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly service , clean room , great view , great location , nice amenities , quiet rooms . I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family if the are making a trip to Chicago . Overall exceeded my expectations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly Bo ##uti ##que Hotel a block off the water offering a nice restaurant , fancy cocktail bar , and great breakfast options . Park ##ing at the hotel is $ 67 for 24 ##hr ##s which is not bad , and you can get your car out if u need it for no additional charge . The room was fantastic ! Clean , black ##out d ##rap ##es , full amenities if u need . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our ( standard ) room was quite spacious and comfortable . The breakfast was very good and well worth the small ( $ 15 ? per person - - tip not included ) additional fee . Park ##ing is expensive ( $ 46 - - which is the ' discount ##ed rate ' - - a $ 3 savings ) , but in keeping with downtown Chicago ' s comparable offerings . Would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the So ##fit ##el for a weekend downtown for our twin daughters ’ 4th birthday . Everything was amazing ! The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . When the check - in desk learned we were there to celebrate a birthday , they gave each of the girls a te ##ddy bear as a present . That set the tone for a magical birthday weekend where the girls felt so special . They keep talking about going back to the princess hotel ! The rooms were beautiful , clean and comfortable . The location is perfect for downtown activities . High ##ly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel staff was friendly and helpful , the hotel was very elegant and I would recommend to any of my married friends to take advantage of this romantic get away . The next time I ' m in Chicago I will def ##fine ##tly be staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a one night stay to see Hamilton . This was the best Hilton option and we had not stayed here . Way larger a property than we prefer but very impressive and elegant in public spaces . Check in service din ##ged the one star . Lac ##k ##luster . No mention of being Hilton Honors ( but saw others get the free water and W ##i ##F ##i password ) : I went down later to get the H ##H password . Room was fine . No coffee / Ke ##uri ##g which would have been really nice given how huge the hotel is and long lines downstairs . A + + + to the bell staff who were friendly , greeted us and offered directions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was amazing , right on the magnificent mile . Within walking distance of all the great shops and restaurants . This place has great views , great staff , wonderful am ##ent ##ies . Room service was great and they had anything available you may have forgotten . They also offer free water your whole stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 5 nights , great location , quick check in . Great size room and very quiet . Air Con was great . Check out in ##vo ##ice is sent to you room night before you ' re due to leave which is very handy and if no issue you can walk straight out . The hotel is a great location about 10 min walk to Navy Pier . Would highly recommend as location for stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is among the nice ##st hotels I ' ve every visited . . . and I ' ve stayed at quite a few in my years of business and personal travel .

My first impression of the room was , [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton never seems to di ##sa ##pp ##oint and this location is no exception . Absolutely perfect location in the heart of the city . Head down the block to Hubbard street and El He ##fe ta ##quer ##ia for some great atmosphere and drinks . Eat in the restaurant attached to the hotel and don ' t miss the pan ##cakes for breakfast . Best I have ever had . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing location , amazing staff , amazing hotel . The view on top level floors is impressive to say the least . Their restaurant ; Baptiste and Bo ##ttle offers not only a ma ##gni ##ficient view of the city but also proposes quality cocktail ##s and an am ##bian ##ce to make anyone want to extend their stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we checked in to the moment we left the service was great . We were made to feel very , very welcome . The location is excellent . The rooms are very large - we were in the executive wing as a S ##pire Ambassador member . One morning I filled in the W ##i ##F ##i question ##naire and said it would be great to have more water and some fresh milk . 10 min ##s later both arrived ! Excellent service . Instead of using my watch to tell the time , I could just look out of the window and use the clock on top of the W ##rig ##ley building ! Chicago is a great city too . Really enjoyed our visit . Had an awful stay at the Intercontinental Barclay in New York recently so this put my faith back in Intercontinental service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this place felt Lu ##x ##uri ##ous and class ##y . Lots of history from this hotel . Easy check in and friendly helpful staff . check out the Ball room very cool . We had breakfast at ni ##cks downstairs and received good service , and good food but very price ##y . Location was perfect . Lots of high end shopping close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel a couple blocks off of Michigan Ave ! It is recently upgraded ( floor ##ing and furniture ) and junior suite is very spacious ! The room was well decorated and the staff was very welcoming an helpful ! My stay was in November and they have great holiday decorations up at the hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed on a Thursday night ( 3 / 30 / 2017 ) in room 31 ##7 . Located in the heart of downtown Chicago , Hotel Ki ##nz ##ie provided great customer service on top of a great view . Breakfast options are great ! Our room had very clean , modern de ##cor . There was a nice bench by the large windows . The robes were my favorite ! Front desk was very cord ##ial and kept in touch with us throughout our stay . 10 / 10 would recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ; Great Room ; Great Pool for the kids . Book room 4000 if you have a family of 5 . . . kids loved it and we did too as we had our space once we put the kids to bed and some great views of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a grand old dam ##e , but dated . The nickel and dim ##e you for ever ##thing . The cater ##ed food is not up to what you would expect and the staff is sur ##ley . They act like they don ' t want to be here . I was there for a conference and really wish I booked some where else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at the Intercontinental a couple of times and it always meets my needs . Door ##man extra ##ord ##ina ##ire Will always points me in the right direction , easily flags down a car or shows me where to look out for an u ##ber . I ' d like a little bigger lobby so it ' s easier to meet people I ' m traveling with but the Star ##bu ##cks is a good stand - in . The area provides several restaurants and stores to pick up anything I ' ve forgotten . Overall , a great place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We held our 700 + guest event at Swiss ##ote ##l in April 2018 . Their staff ' s attention detail and customer service was second to none . I also had an incredible suite with the most amazing view of Navy Pier . I highlight recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super facilities , staff , and beautiful ! You would be very impressed by all the services offered including the Internet , staff , beautiful facilities , decorations , outside seating , bar ##be ##cue dinner , and delicious breakfast ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] All ##egro is perfectly situated for theater go ##ers and business people alike . The small bathroom ##s and in ##con ##ven ##ient elevators are a small n ##ui ##sance but made up for by friendly staff , prose ##cco happy hour and L ##OC ##AT ##ION . We will definitely be back as we come here 25 times a year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , friendly staff , awesome breakfast , very clean rooms , kid friendly , beautiful views , very nice pool , and great price ! We stayed this past weekend with our 1 and 3 year old they had very nice pack and plays ready for us set up in the room . Less than a block from the subway . The kids loved the pool . We had a king suite it was the perfect size for our family of 4 . The full kitchen was extremely handy with 2 little ones . The v ##alet service was very nice and helpful as ##well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located a block away from The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ene ##t Mile , a wonderful shopping area to explore ! The suites are well appointed . We stayed in a corner suite with a sky ##line view that was awesome . There is a very large grocery store just two short blocks away , and good , reasonably priced restaurants are within a block or two . There was an extensive breakfast in a din ##ning area every m ##ori ##ning . House ##keeping was very thorough . Light rail was less than a block away , and cab ##s are everywhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved being within walking distance to Mill ##eni ##um Park and the Art Institute of Chicago . Alexander at the front desk was especially helpful with local coffee shop and nearby shopping recommendations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for a conference that was being held on site . The conference rooms were nice as was my King Superior Room . I wish I could have stayed a day or two longer to enjoy it . The food was decent - though I do wish they had more options as far as breakfast goes for people who don ' t eat bacon / pork . There were no other meat options to choose from . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I just wanted to recognize Nick , one of the front desk team members . He had a friendly smile greeting me to check in . He was also very helpful with recommendations , which is always appreciated . I loved the convenient location of this hotel . The am ##bie ##nce of this hotel is wonderful . Room accommodation ##s were great . Thanks again Nick ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The only problem I had was the mini bar was locked which isn ’ t told to the customer and I broke my finger ##nail ! However the excellent customer service displayed by De ##met ##rius Hall , Ronald , Will , a young black lady name Teresa and our waiter at the M ##J Restaurant ( Luis ? ) I ’ ll keep coming back ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] We travel to Chicago several times a year to visit our daughter and love staying at the Ambassador . Our trip last weekend started perfectly when we arrived and were greeted by the v ##alet and given an updated room with a view of the lake . We are careful travelers but left one item in our room . One call to Felix in Security and the item was located and sent back to us . We look forward to our next visit in June [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel accepted to cancel our reservation without fee due to the current sa ##ni ##tary situation while we had not booked with a cancellation facility . T ##HA ##N ##K YOU V ##ER ##Y M ##UC ##H Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel ! ! Next time in Chicago we visit you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The entire staff could not do enough for you . We upgraded to a suite and had a beautiful room with a very large bathroom . I have stayed at other hotels in the Gold Coast and this was the best ! Looking forward to going back the next time we are in Chicago . m [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel , huge ( 42 floors I believe ) very clean and modern and well maintained with lots of room . Our room wasn ’ t able to be checked into at check in time ( 3 ##pm ) and so we waited and waited until I ’ d finally had enough and we were upgraded to a river view room for free and able to check in straight away . I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who likes a high - standard of living . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wasn ' t sure what to expect during this unusual summer , but this place was better than expected . We had a suite , with amazing windows floor to ceiling . We checked in early a couple of hours without any has ##sle . Did not try the " to go " breakfast , but did enjoy the " happy hour " wine . Great location on a semi - quiet street . Easy walk to the River ##walk , Michigan Ave , and Mill ##eni ##um Park . Also , the price for a suite was lower than a standard room at most of the other nice hotels in the area . Also , lady at front desk told us about " spot hero " app that saved us $ 50 on parking . Great deal ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] fair price , great location , generous with water , easy check in and out , nice rooms , com ##fy beds , free apps and drink token ##s to lounge upstairs , 20 % off at nearby br ##ew ##pu ##b , s ##tron easy w ##if ##i . wish this could be replica ##te at all hotels . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##f ##gic ##ent Mile many times . . . . . the service is great . . . . from the curb to your room all employees meet you with a smile and helpful ##ness . I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who visits downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t down in October for a convention and even with all the people around service was great . Quick check in and an upgraded room with a spectacular view of the river and pier . Room was very clean and we kept . P ##lent ##y of options in walking distance . De ##fin ##ite ##ly stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wow w ##ow w ##ow . I have stayed here before but they have up ##ped their game . Many thank you to the front desk for making me feel like the most important guest that day ! I appreciated the upgrade as well . . . My shout out goes to the two wonderful ladies at the entrance on Monday morning ! It was rain ##ing cats and dogs but . . . I managed to get into my ride , dry and I love the compliment ##ary umbrella ! [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] The in - room dining experience was terrible . Our breakfast was delayed by an hour and we had to call - in to check the status before the food was sent . The breakfast was cold , and the toast was burnt . Not acceptable for the extremely high rate charged for the in - room dining . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the location and the warm atmosphere of this lovely hotel , bar and restaurant . 5 star every time ! Service and food always perfect for each of my gatherings ; Thanksgiving dinner , entertaining clients , coffee with friends and drinks after work ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for a Chicago Symphony concert last weekend . The Palmer House is in a perfect location - - just a few minute walk to Symphony Center , or the Art Institute . The Italian Village restaurant is just a couple blocks away , Berg ##hoff ' s a block or two more , State Street is just outside the door for holiday shopping . What a wonderful hotel ; the lobby itself is a g ##em . Yes , elevators can be a bit of a wait , but what ' s the rush anyway ? The parking garage connected to the hotel is price ##y , but convenient . It ' s a trip just trying to snake around in the underground lot , and spaces are tight , but it ' s all part of the fun . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a beautiful property with great service and excellent location . We had a corner suite and my Sister in law and hub ##by had a studio king . Both rooms were very spacious and well appointed . Food and drink in the restaurant was excellent . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the pleasure of meeting 2 of the most friend ##liest staff members at the Chicago Hilton on South Michigan a ##ve . Rachel and C ##iar ##ia . I was there for two days for a company event . They were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and I could tell they really loved their job . Thank you Rachel and C ##iara for making my stay a good one ! ! ! Mo ##y [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kids ages 8 , 10 , 12 , and 13 in my group . We had a great time swimming each day . The pool is warm and clean and in a beautiful historic space . The locker rooms were clean and nice and the work ##out rooms were nice . They even had a movie at the pool Saturday night . The kids loved it . The location was perfect , and as always with the Intercontinental , the beds were comfortable and the rooms quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Last weekend we were in Chicago for a wedding and stayed at the Fair ##mont . The rooms were well appointed , the staff was very friendly and the price was extremely reasonable . We were offered an upgrade to their Gold Level for $ 45 . 00 . I would H ##IG ##HL ##Y recommend taking them up on this offer as it really made our trip . This is a private lounge on the 15th floor that offered great views , service and food options throughout the day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for our Real ##tor convention in November 2017 and it was very nice . Beautiful view of the river and the lake . Lots of nice restaurants in the area as well . The staff was very friendly and the breakfast / lunch restaurant in the hotel was very good . Our room was very nice , the bed was super comfortable as are all She ##rato ##n beds : ) My only complaint was the bathroom . . . needed some up ##dating . It was fine but nothing fancy , could have mistaken it for a holiday inn bathroom . Overall great stay and if coming back to Chicago would certainly want to stay here : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I spent three days at the hotel before I spent another three days at the hotel for a conference . We arrived very early on Friday morning and found everyone to be welcoming and extremely helpful . Our reservations were confirmed and bags secured while we toured the city waiting for a call on our room . Frances , Mike and Eric were extremely helpful and pleasant . Frances ensured we would have a room as soon as one was available - which occurred by noon . Eric assured us our bags would be safe , including my precious laptop - which occurred . And Mike helped us with some tour ideas . All six days were fantastic . The location was great and the service even better . Thank you Hotel Monaco Chicago for making our personal and professional visit a huge success ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we asked to change to a larger room they were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , no hesitation from the front desk . It ’ s a hotel that puts you first , the breakfast are suitable and the bar is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . You ’ re in walking distance of Michigan Avenue and some good local restaurants in the area . We have never had a bad experience and have stayed there several times in the past 10 years . Randy & Susan [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago for 4 nights and all were great . We had an issue with the television but the Guest service and engineer department resolved very quickly once reported . Bed ##s were very comfortable . Would recommend to all my friends . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was very impressed with the clean ##liness , comfort , and customer service at the Talbot ##t ! The check in experience was wonderful and I even got a compliment ##ary drink v ##ou ##cher . My room was beautiful , light and air ##y , and the bed was comfortable which is very important to me . The bathroom was gorgeous and im ##ma ##culate . I ’ ve stayed at many hotels downtown Chicago and this is my new favorite ! I will definitely be staying again and I can ’ t wait ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I arrived at 7 ##am , fresh off the red ##eye , didn ' t sleep a wink and it showed . Ra ##quel , on the front desk , was f ##aa ##abulous , came to the rescue and went above and beyond . The only thing this woman was missing , was a cape and a helmet as she was my S ##UP ##ER H ##ER ##O . Excellent service , with a smile . Pure employee - GO ##LD . C ##lone this lady , she loves her job and it shows ! ! The room , view , amenities are all 5 star . I ' m very happy with my decision to stay here ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was easy to reach from the train taken from the airport , the location put us exactly where we wanted to be in terms of Chicago food , entertainment and museums . This is where we will come back to again because we were impressed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We go back every year for a music festival in Grant Park and visit Kate at the Kitty O ’ Shea ##s Irish bar in the Hilton . She ’ s so at ##ten ##tive and keeps us coming back for more . If you want a good laugh and a quick wit , she ’ s your gal ! You ’ ll find our large group there every day and / or night of our trip . . . P . S . see if she will bet you on being able to break an Irish s ##hill ##le ##lag ##h hanging on the wall ! . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are a bit dated . Air ##con very noisy . Place is a bit soul ##less . Main bar was shut . Very large halls and areas that lack character . The fitness suite is average . The location is good . That ’ s about it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister and I stopped by for a quick drink at the Martin ##i Bar . Steve the bartender was a joy , very nice guy . We had never been in the hotel before so we asked the manager about the hotel and the kind of room we would need so we can possibly hold our Summer Sister weekend here . Candace greeted us with a warm smile and was very sweet we had a lot of questions ha ##ha ! We hope to see you this summer Candace ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small hotel , perfect location , well designed . . . Service was very persona ##ble . We had a big group with a few complications . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and flexible ! Cut ##e happy hour every evening on the sixth floor . We will definitely return ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##abulous setting . Easy to reach all areas and ability to do most events without vehicle . De ##fin ##ite ##ly would stay here again . Was fine doing a review until I was required to submit 200 characters to be able to continue [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was very clean , especially the bathroom . I had one issue with the plug in the bathroom and mentioned it to staff on my way out . When I returned the issue was fixed - not just g ##loss ##ed over - actually fixed . I can ' t say enough about the quality of the staff . I interact ##ed with the front desk three times , door ##men twice and restaurant twice - in addition to the house ##keeping staff mentioned earlier . My room was quiet , I occasionally heard traffic noise - but mostly it was quiet . The room was really clean - especially the bathroom . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been coming here since the late 90 ' s and while the hotel has had a beautiful renovation one thing that hasn ' t changed is the outstanding customer service . D ##wayne greet ##s me every trip with a huge welcome and smile . I look forward to seeing him every trip . This hotel is truly a home away from home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##M ##NI is a luxury hotel on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It is a great location to everything . We took the train to Midway airport . We walked two to three blocks to the red line then transferred to the orange line . The cost was $ 2 . 25 , not sure I would walk it in the winter though . The rooms were clean , spacious and very nicely done . The shower head was better at The Talbot ##t that we stayed at but the work ##out equipment was better here . Free w ##if ##i as well here . Our only complaint was the noise from the ambulance ##s and other traffic we heard at odd hours . Could have been room location as well . Friendly staff and all around good hotel . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie was a great hotel for us . Room ##s were clean and spacious . The Ki ##nz ##ie is pretty central to shopping , restaurants and city sights . It is also a short walk from the Metro that goes straight to Oh ##are Airport . The breakfast was ok - no hot food but a range of cereal ##s & past ##ries . A definite bonus was the happy hour each night with beer , wine and bar snack ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very well located , 2 blocks from Michigan A ##v , few steps to Red Line Subway station . The Suite is large with living room and kitchen ##ette well equipped . Very comfortable bed . Well served breakfast . It has a swimming pool , gym and a coin operated laundry . From Mon to T ##hu they offer a very good compliment ##ary happy - your ( 5 to 7 ##pm ) , with few hot food , salad , soup , snack ##s , wine , beer , etc . The staff service is excellent , all very at ##ten ##tive . I recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Too ##k my daughter to Chicago for a short weekend get ##away and stayed at the Ken ##zie Hotel . The staff was amazing and took great care of us . Guest service manager , Melissa is the best , she made sure our weekend was perfect . Ra ##cha ##el at front desk was wonderful with helping us with dinner suggestions and was so welcoming . Eric was so friendly and made sure to go out of his way to greet us each time we returned and took great care with our luggage . Front desk was so helpful with na ##vi ##gating the city and helping us figure out best way to get to Northwestern for college tour . Room ##s are so cute , very clean and breakfast was perfect , it was just enough and tasted very fresh . Would highly recommend staying at this great bout ##ique hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad Hotel exceeded all expectations ! The lobby is on the 20th floor . The door ##man led us to the elevator and sent us on our way up to the lobby . The registration desk personnel already knew our name because the door ##man alerted the desk we were on our way . Very cool . Our room on the 15th floor was large and comfortable . And , also , super clean ! Very modern . All controls ( lights and windows shades ) were on touch controls . The location is great . It ’ s just a half a block off of Michigan Avenue . The Conrad certainly made us feel special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My recent stay in the Fair ##mont was the first time I had stayed at this property during my many trips to Chicago . The size and comfort of the rooms , the interior appointments , and the quiet ##ness of the room were all first - class . Room was im ##ma ##culate , the bed was very comfortable and the shower / bath was luxurious . I was on the 12th floor near the elevators , and never heard a sound while in my room . H ##VA ##C unit was very quiet as well . The staff was very pleasant , and the check - in and check - out experience was smooth and efficient . The property is in the heart of Chicago and within easy walking distance of Michigan Avenue and lakes ##ide parks . With so many choices available in downtown Chicago , I can highly recommend this hotel - particularly for business travelers . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel and staff were excellent , however television service s ##tin ##ks ! ! ! Downtown Chicago and terrible television service come on ! However there was an employee young black man named Ronald , excellent , excellent customer service ! ! ! That pool ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here over the Christmas holiday and can honestly say this hotel is one of the best we have stayed in . The staff are court ##eous and highly at ##ten ##tive . All our needs were met . The rooms were clean to a very high standard and very comfortable . We were traveling with a 9 month old baby and the hotel had a c ##ri ##b ready and waiting in the room when we arrived . Check in was smooth and efficient . Every morning the door ##men greeted us and asked if we needed any help with directions . Location was incredibly central , a walk from the shops , Lincoln Park Zoo , Millennium Park etc . The food in the restaurant , bar and room service was outstanding and good value compared with other options . Thank you for a perfect holiday . We will be back again , by hook or by c ##rook ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The three key features I seek in a business hotel are quality internet access , an express ##o coffee venue I can find in the morning without needing to get dressed , and a decent exercise facility for the end of the day . A decent bed , shower , and dressing space are table stakes . The Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile scores with two bonus features : a te ##rri ##fic heated junior o ##ly ##mp ##ic pool and a 190 degree dry sa ##una . There ' s also a steak ##house on site , Michael Jordan , but it attracts a loud tourist crowd so I can ' t recommend it for environment although the kitchen does a fine job of things . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot is our favorite - they exceed expectation every time we stay with them . If you are planning a trip to Chicago you need to consider these guys . This place out of their way to make your trip a special one . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is without a doubt one of the finest hotels in Chicago . As a retired sales director I have stayed at literally hundreds of hotels around the world and The Ki ##nz ##ie is one of my favorites . It is not the fan ##cies ##t and it is certainly not the largest but it is without a doubt one of the friend ##liest and most welcoming . The rooms are very clean , comfortable and well appointed . Martin Ben ##ster and his staff greet you every morning with a smile and are happy to assist you with anything to make your stay more pleasant . My wife and I have stayed here several times and wouldn ’ t think of staying anywhere else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location near State street and the river . Numerous excellent restaurants within walking distance . A great base from which to launch the numerous sights ##ee ##ing trips . So many attractions are nearby . The staff is friendly and helpful . The rooms are crisp and clean . Price ##s are reasonable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was exceptional at this hotel . From the service in the reception area , to the parking v ##alet ##s , to the servers and the bartender ##s . Top notch . I left my wedding ring behind and called the hotel the next day . One of their house ##keeping employees had turned it in , May ##ra was her name . They mail ##ed it back ex ##ped ##iti ##ously . The room was a standard king on the 8th floor . Very very small . But , very updated , sleek and clean . The only thing that could use some improvement was the bar stool ##s and some of the waiting area chairs need serious re ##up ##hol ##ster ##ing and are very din ##gy . But , that is so minimal . We would stay here again if the price point continues to be as good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The beds were comfortable and staff , overall were polite . However , I was over ##charged for one of my 5 nights . I was there for a convention and when I pointed out that they had not provided me with the group rate for 1 of the 5 nights , they refused to adjust my bill , saying that I would have to contact convention plan ##ners that had contracted with the hotel ! This despite that fact that all 5 nights were within the convention dates for the group rate . Also , my room was not cleaned one of the days . When paying that much for a hotel room , one does expect that it will be cleaned daily . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a vacation all in itself . Full of history character and culture . In a great central location . I had the breakfast on one occasion and b ##uff ##et style was varied and p ##lent ##iful with at ##ten ##tive and chat ##ty waiting staff . Generally the hotel was very busy because of marathon weekend but it all flowed well and was a pleasant experience to stay here . Room ##s were comfortable and clean [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our recent stay at the Fair ##mont . Their Con ##cier ##ge Ba ##g - check is amazing . We were able to drop our luggage off 6 hours before our check in time to enjoy time in the city and then check our bags for another 8 hours after our check - out to continue to enjoy downtown Chicago . Super close to Millennium Park and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . But be ##ware , the bottle of water in your room costs $ 10 . . . so if you can avoid opening it , you stay will be perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at Palmer House over the weekend . The location is ideal , one block away from Michigan Avenue , Millennium Park , shopping , theaters and restaurants . Our room was large , comfortable and clean . The lobby is elegant and the service was great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is relaxing and has great amenities ! Staff is very nice and helpful . The free dinner social ##s and breakfast ##s are some of the best compliment ##ary meals we have had ! ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly worth the stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice location and great services . Front staff was amazing and rooms were very clean . Breakfast was outstanding in the morning . We love it . We will like to go again and very close to all city attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over ##look ##ing the Chicago River and Trump Tower and just over the bridge from the south end of Michigan Ave . This is a hotel in the small / bout ##ique category . The rooms are good sized , clean and comfortable . The prices are fair . Close proximity to the theater district , Millennium Park , The Loop and walking distance to almost everything you might want to visit . The Kim ##pton philosophy speaks to how other hotels should be run . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location was great in downtown Chicago . So much better than being stuck out at McCormick . Conference facilities were sufficient . Room ##s are in desperate need of a renovation . On most basic level , my room was very must ##y . This is not acceptable for a hotel of this level . Staff was helpful and well trained . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful location and place to stay ! Rest ##au ##rent is a must to try for dinner ! Corner bakery is close by , more affordable breakfast there ! Easy to walk to most sights , or a simple cab ride < $ 10 . To the theatre district ! Great hotel ! Thanks O ##m ##ni ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bo ##uti ##que hotel with great location and value price related to lobby being painted during our stay . Close to restaurants and shopping . Nice lobby bar and restaurant . Vale ##t parking . Friendly staff . Modern , sleek de ##cor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is the main reason for choosing this hotel . It is 2 blocks from the lake shore and close to Ma ##g mile and numerous bars and restaurants . We were not disappointed in other ways either . The staff make this hotel as good as it is , they are all excellent . The room was very comfortable and a decent size . The only disappointing aspect for us was the breakfast , it was average and expensive . Other than that we had a great stay there and would definitely go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton hotels are the best - great de ##cor & pleasant employees . Located in theatre area of downtown Chicago . Con ##cier ##ge was very helpful in finding several services for me during my stay . Room & bathroom were slightly small but very comfortable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The guest service was so rude . It was my wedding day and the room supposed to be for four people . There was only one bed available and when I asked the guest service for two more extra beds they ignored me for the first two times . and the third time , they rude ##ly told me that we are out of bed and your guest can sleep on couch ! first of all , there was no couch that people could sleep on ! and secondly , there was no extra pillow or blanket . At the end of the day , we went to the lobby and finally they magical ##ly find 7 extra beds and they sent the beds at our room at 2 ##am on my wedding day ! Just imagine how they made me angry and tired for my wedding day ! The room was spacious and the lobby is beautiful . The only issue was the guest service which was terrible ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice and clean room with large bathroom . Hotel is located very well with a lot of Restaurant ##s and shopping possibilities around . Breakfast was not good : You have to carry it back to your room , the selection never changes , there are no warm dishes and most of the stuff is extremely sweet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed there during the Chicago Marathon weekend . I found the hotel perfect . The room was clean , beds were comfortable , good bathroom and good amenities . Staff were pleasant , specially the bell ##men . Front desk staff were a bit s ##nob ##by and not very f ##re ##ind ##ly . The hotel is old but the rooms have been recently renovated . Good location , on the magnificent mile . Great shops and great walking . [SEP]
0	[CLS] As an interior designer , the first thing that drew me to this restaurant was the design . Swan ##ky and elegant , you can ' t help but feel like a million bucks when you ' re at this place . The lobby is especially gorgeous - and with coffee in the morning and prose ##cco in the evening , it ' s truly a place where people gather and hang out . The room was not huge , but was perfectly adequate for my needs and was clean as can be . I would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel nearly weekly for work and this is the best service experience I have had at a hotel in the US in years . The staff is incredible , room was perfectly cleaned , and excellent location . I would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I usually stay at The Drake ( which is great too ) . This was my first stay at Hotel Monaco and I could not have been more impressed by the friendly staff , the beautiful post - modern de ##cor , the location , clean ##liness , facilities . . . you name it and this place has it . The compliment ##ary wine and ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres served at 5 in the lobby were a nice treat and there were lots of guests relaxing and talking during this time . The location of the Monaco is right off the river ##walk and close to the Miracle Mile shopping as well as Mill ##ennial Park and some of the museums . The Virgin Hotel right next door has a fantastic diner style restaurant too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is excellent and central for everything , within walking distance of shopping , bars and restaurants and you can get anywhere from here . The hotel is an older building and could do with some re ##furbishment in the public areas and elevators but this is my only criticism . The room was very quiet and comfortable , the bed was incredible and just perfect . I would stay here again for business or pleasure when next in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we arrived we felt at home . Will greeted us with a smile grabbed our luggage helped us check in . The bell ##man told us about the room ’ s features and places to visit near the hotel . Lu ##nch was great at Michael Jordan ’ s . The Room was very comfortable . The exercise facility was f ##abulous and the pool was so cool . We had wonderful weekend looking forward to returning [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel staff is extremely friendly and ready to assist . The rooms are well appointed and recently renovated . Location is ideal . Overall , great experience . And perfect for both business as well as pleasure stays . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quiet , private , lovely rooms , great view . Stay ##ed for four nights while in Chicago to visit our daughter . The room wasn ’ t huge but perfect layout and just what we needed for a home base while we ran around the city . The hotel is central ##ly located and the rooftop bar has a great view of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Restaurant ##s , shopping , lake ##front , all the best right at your fingertips . We just happened to be here during the air and water show . What a treat ! Excellent breakfast , nice bar , at ##ten ##tive staff make for a great stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Alexandra was a queen : check in top notch . She was understanding of my personal struggles upon check in . She gave me the top floor , compliment ##ary toilet ##ry gifts , and the comfort and hospitality was top notch . This hotel should be 5 stars just for her service . I will certainly return in the near future . Thank you all for making this a memorable stay . I have yet to receive better service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at the Palmer House over the years , and some things have been upgraded nicely . The fitness center is a nice addition . The staff is extremely helpful and friendly . The location is also great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ling for business Location - Excellent , Loop , near the river and magnificent mile . Can ##not be fault ##ed . Check in - quick and easy . Room - Dec ##or is badly in need of an update , the hotel feels old and s ##tale . The rooms are of ok size but are dark and feel old . Bed average . Bath ##room - Average , shower in the tub , poor flow , Room service - limited choice but at least you can order locally delivered to your room . Staff - excellent and friendly Breakfast - did not try but many options to eat out . Value - expensive for what it is . Would I return - unlikely , there are better option in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Home ##wood Suite - Downtown Chicago for the Chicago Marathon weekend . The hotel is beautiful and the rooms had everything we needed . The staff was friendly and helpful . The location was close to a grocery store , many restaurants and bars and public transit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice ##ly re modeled older Chicago Hotel . Park ##ing garage attached . Large lobby and beautiful . Everyone who works here is helpful and friendly . Mar ##q ##us checked us in and took great care in working with us to make sure our needs are all met . Ba ##gg ##age handled professionally and with thoughtful care . To ##ns of meeting rooms ! Very cold inside ( it ' s summer ) . The rooms are large and clean . Maybe not the windows but the views are f ##abulous . Many wings to the building and different elevators depending on which floor . There is a nice sized fitness center , indoor pool , and outside lo ##ung ##ing . There are fireworks you can see from some rooms . View ##s if Buckingham Fountain and navy pier or museums and soldier field . En ##joy ##ed staying here . E ##ase to walk everywhere from here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a well placed hotel for a short break in Chicago . Close to the art gallery , this great hotel is well worth checking out if you can find a great deal . We upgraded to a room on the executive level and for that you get a continental breakfast and some ni ##bble ##s from 5 ##pm every day . Ad ##d in free tea and coffee & soft drinks and it is well worth the upgrade fee ( plus the private elevators straight to the executive floor ) . The room was spacious and well looked after . Give this place a go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very clean with great service . It also happens to be in a great location with nearby parking if needed . E ##asily walk to Millennium Park , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Navy Pier , and River ##walk . Just beautiful ! Will definitely stay here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this new hotel - it moved in November . The staff is first rate and the rooms are huge . Fantastic property perfectly located in downtown . The property being new has advantages as well . Nice work ##out room too [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a gorgeous old hotel with so much character . The lobby is stunning . With the mobile Hilton app you can check in , choose your room , and get your room key , so it ' s very convenient . I have found very large rooms away from the elevators , stairs , and ice machines using the app . I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had the pleasure of staying at the Ambassador Hotel a few weeks ago . Location is amazing , I was completely blown away from the interior design , and staff was so welcoming and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to their guests needs ! The Library is a great place for a cup of coffee or a cocktail and their restaurant , Booth One , was phenomena ##l ! We will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Chicago has style & awesome beds as well as in room fresh br ##ew ##ed Star ##bu ##cks coffee ! Every room has a spectacular view . I look forward to returning every year to experience its unique design & f ##abulous surroundings , especially the view of the river & Navy Pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For over 50 years I have come to this hotel as my parents were married here in 1950 at that time this hotel was called the Stevens Hotel . We love going to eat at Kitty ' s . We get a lake ##front room with breath taking views of the lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel in a great location . We walked from here to both the Sky ##D ##eck and the Mu ##su ##em campus . We got a room on the first of the ex ##ec ##ti ##tive floors with a lake view . The View was gorgeous . The room was nice and clean with the new standard soft beds . This room had two bathroom ##s which was really nice . Do not pick this if you want quiet though . Could hear everything from the hallway and the traffic below . Along with the trains going by and the bands ##tan ##d from a block away . But it was nice to listen to the music and watch the boats on the lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Top shelf hotel and staff . Great location . The young bell ##man working the sidewalk Sunday morning was great ! Would not to hesitate to stay here again . The steak ##house restaurant on the first floor is convenient and the service was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My favorite hotel in Downtown Chicago . Its beautiful , grand and historic . The lobby with its architectural details is amazing ! The rooms is great . Bed ##s are comfortable . The bathroom is spacious and amenities are First Class . Staff are excellent . Great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the text ##ing option . The staff is very friendly and very helpful . The room was clean and the cleaning staff did a great job . I would give the staff and room a five star ! Rate ##d four because there could be some work done in the hallway ##s , base ##boards were dirty and scrapped up . . . a little paint and some ca ##ul ##king would s ##pruce it up ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was beautiful , but we were particularly impressed with the hotel staff , who were welcoming and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Brian ##na White , our guest relations specialist , made sure that we had special treats waiting for us after our train arrival was delayed by more than 13 hours . There were great bicycles available , and good restaurants nearby . A new full service restaurant at the hotel was not yet open . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My son is a sophomore at L ##UC , and is living at the Water Tower Campus . The hotel was incredibly convenient and comfortable , located literally 800 feet away . Of the 8 hotels I have stayed in the last month , The Talbot ##t had the best bathroom set up , with 2 sinks AND te ##rri ##fic lighting for applying makeup . All of the staff went above and beyond to be friendly , to help or offer suggestions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We thoroughly enjoyed our stay . The room was phenomena ##l . . . quiet , clean , comfortable , and a view of Chicago . We had 2 unpleasant experiences in the past year with O ##m ##ni hotels ( Tucson and Pittsburgh ) and the Chicago stay restored our loyalty . Please thank the O ##m ##ni Chicago team for us . We hope to return soon . Also , the compliment ##ary morning beverage service is my favorite treat , and the turn down service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel through Hot ##wire and I was so happy when I saw the hotel in person . Super cute bout ##ique hotel and the staff was awesome ! I will definitely stay here again . The hotel was also in the perfect location walking distance from everything ! Or just a short U ##ber ride away ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Ho ##yle which had been newly renovated . Great location about one and a half blocks from Michigan Avenue . My only com ##pliant was the internet service . Service was very s ##poradic ! I would stay again , very clean and friendly staff ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is extremely well located on Chicago and is within walking distance of a number of theaters and good restaurants . The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the overall feel of the hotel was good . The staff were very friendly and check in and out was easy . Their happy hour was also a great experience and provided the opportunity to relax and potentially to get to know others staying there as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful get ##away experience at this hotel . The views were nice and the location is un ##par ##alle ##led : close enough to everything we wanted to see and do while in Chicago . Our only complaint was that the front desk was not always friendly and as helpful as should be expected at this level of hotel . However , the rest our experience was excellent due in large part to the other staff . The Fair ##mont Gold floor was pleasant ##ly welcoming and the service was outstanding . The Gold floor con ##cier ##ge and staff were warm and helpful . Our server Man ##dal ##a was friendly and provided wonderful service . She was a pleasure to meet and she made our stay a very enjoyable experience . Overall , we would recommend the hotel and in particular the Gold floor . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wow . What an amazing hotel and staff any travel ##er would love . For once , I get to enjoy a hotel ' s best offering , as a vacation ##er . This place is a five - star plus . No short ##coming ##s . The accommodation ##s were perfectly centered on the travel ##er ' s needs . The staff could not have been more professionals and friendly . The hotel location offered access to many tourist spots within walking distance . I will definitely stay here again . Worth the price . S ##p ##lu ##rge . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was very clean . We had plenty of room in the 2 room suite . The sofa sleep ##er was comfortable . The king bed was very comfortable . The free breakfast in the morning was very good with lots of choices . I had read reviews of slow elevators but we had no trouble all weekend . The location was great ! Walking distance to Hancock , American girl , Michigan a ##ve shopping and lots of restaurants . I would definitely stay here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It has a holiday and we are recovering from the co ##ve but I just had someone at the front desk that seemed to be disc ##rim ##inating me because I am female and I look relatively a lot younger than I am . I was solo and I am a Hispanic female . The hotel is cool but a lot of it was average and the bed could have been cleaner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a Hilton H ##hon ##ors member , I typically choose Hilton properties when traveling for business and pleasure . The Chicago Conrad has become or " go to " hotel when visiting Chicago . The standard rooms are spacious and nicely appointed , large bathroom ##s , and nice amenities ( ups ##cale coffee makers , mini refrigerator ##s , and quality s ##ham ##po ##o / condition ##er / soap ) . The location is great - a very short walk to the CT ##A Red Line , a block from the Miracle Mile , and several great restaurants nearby . No need for a rental car when staying at the Conrad . Subway connections to O ' Hare or Midway are relatively easy . We enjoyed the rooftop bar in the evening , and breakfast was very good and service was excellent . The hotel team was highly re ##sp ##ons ##ive and made sure everything was right during our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a clean spacious room with two bathroom ##s . The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas . Service was lovely . We stayed here for five nights while attending a convention at McCormick Center and the shuttle ride was less than 10 minutes . We were close to shopping . Our only disappointment was the restaurants . The food was me ##dio ##cre e ##and expensive in the two full service restaurants and in the self service restaurant . Good restaurants were a short walk or cab ride away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n was clean , central ##ly located and had well sized rooms . The gym facilities were excellent ( clean , lots of equipment , cold towels ) but the pool was a disappointment . Staff were friendly and very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had superb service . Every single person we saw went out of his / her way to help . Check - in was quick and efficient . I didn ' t like the room we were first given , asked about options , and we were upgraded to a huge suite . Very com ##fy bed . Several lovely coffee table books in the room on Chicago architecture and photography . The building is older , g ##rac ##ious architecture , and nice lounge ##s for sitting . Love the location , blocks from both the lake and good restaurants , Di ##v ##vy bikes close or they have ones you can use for a couple hours . Thanks Maria , René , Rey ##na and all the other nice people whose names I don ' t know ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The past five times for our Chicago experience was held at this hotel . Pleasant check in staff was very helpful . My family enjoyed the city view rooms and the location to Michigan Avenue and the Chicago river can ' t be beat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We closed the place down . . . . fun central located gathering location at the end of the evening to kick back and relax . . . . . we had some late night bar food too ! Some friends stayed at hotel they liked , we were down the street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] my room was great though privacy on the third floor is limited since you are surrounded by buildings with third floors and windows that look straight into yours ! that s city living ! Fortunately I had all my blind ##s down when I heard a loud noise . . . opened them up to find a window cleaner hanging out cleaning my windows ! thanks goodness I was decent ##ly dressed ! ! L ##OL ! the staff were helpful though not overly friendly . . . except for the sweet door ##man . But I chose the hotel mainly for its location and the fact that I could walk to so many f ##abulous places , mainly EA ##TA ##L ##Y ! breakfast is included - typical continental type . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was perfect / Will return to this hotel . . . Staff went above and beyond . . . hotel was very clean and the food was outstanding . Looking forward to stay and will return to this hotel for sure ! ! ! Our friends loved all the attractions in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Outstanding experience as always . The personnel were " over the top " friendly and helpful as they always are . The door ##men / bell captains are great people . D ##wayne , Perry and Charles are the best I ' ve ever worked with . The bar and restaurant were excellent as well with the bartender and servers remembering our favorite beverages from our previous stay a ##ws a really nice touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two days at the Swiss ##ote ##l for a business meeting . Staff was friendly , the room was clean and available upon arrival . It was ideal layout and location for a conference but I ' m not sure I ' d want to stay there on a personal trip when a large conference is going on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed in Chicago hundreds of times . This is one of the best places we have stayed . We have paid much more for much less . The room was clean , comfortable and quiet . The staff was helpful . We used room service and the food was really good . A small bar at night was open and they coins for free drinks . The staff parked our car and got it for us each time which was very helpful in the downtown area . The hotel is within walking distance of great restaurants and shopping . We will definitely be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was really nice . Up ##graded to a suite . Room was great . Location to everything was awesome . Would definitely stay here again . I just wish that they offered compliment ##ary breakfast . Didn ' t eat at restaurant but smelled good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 4 nights and was very happy with the the hotel . I had to be in Chicago during the first weekend in June , and needed to be in the Gold Coast area . Un ##bek ##no ##wn ##st to me there is an on ##cology conference in Chicago during the first weekend in June every year , so when I went to make reservations - - 3 months in advance - - all the hotels ( including my favorites ) were booked . The only reservation I could get was at the So ##fit ##el . The members of the staff were very pleasant overall - - I had some lovely interactions with the door ##men and house ##keeping staff . The room was nice , the bed comfortable . I didn ' t spend much time in the hotel except to sleep , but was very happy and would come back . The location is f ##abulous with nearby shopping and restaurants gal ##ore . [SEP]
1	[CLS] De ##fin ##ite ##ly stay here ! Modern , elegant , beautiful ! A ##wes ##ome hotel . Also , the coffee is amazing ! Also , really great service . Close to everything . 5 - minute walk to the nearest El Train stop . Easy to get around . I highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a solid hotel in a great location . There is much to do in the surrounding area with a hop on hop off right across the street . The hotel is well done but not new . I had a pleasant stay with nothing standing out as especially positive or negative [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location to everything , very nice modern rooms . Can ' t beat the free breakfast and then evening reception . Staff was very friendly and helpful . I ' ve stayed here before and it seems that they red ##id the rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed our week at the O ##m ##ni . Our location on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile couldn ' t have been better , while the hotel facilities were all first class . The room was a little dark , so I would advise a City View room when booking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone , its clean and provide a great service . employees are very friendly and welcoming . special thanks to Khan who helps with taxi ##s and luggage . also Dan who helped on the check out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great ! Great restaurants , movie theatre , bowling , Navy Pier , Michigan Ave . . . . all within walking distance . The room was spacious and clean . The bed was comfortable . Staff . . . . where to start . . . . Check in was a long process , Star ##bu ##cks was out of almost everything but plain coffee , it took almost 50 minutes to get the car from v ##alet . See ##med like the hotel was short staffed everywhere ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a really nice stay here . I always find it harder to get really good So ##fit ##el ' s in the USA . Staff and check ##in experience was good , very friendly . Bar and restaurants were good . Our suite had a great view . Location is good too , close to some nice restaurants and things near by , and cheap to u ##ber anywhere else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Te ##rrible hotel ! having traveled all over the world for both work and holidays , I have never seen a similar situation . When I arrived the trash was full of garbage , there was food on the floor . . . not to mention the bathroom ceiling mold ##y and hair . The hotel is unable to change rooms until the next day 2 ##pm . Last time with a Hilton hotel ! See the photos included in my review . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are diamond members with Hilton . We practically live in their hotels . This hotel is poorly run and poorly kept up . Not at all what I expect from this iconic brand . St ##ain ##s everywhere on rug ##s and ceilings , tub has mold , every single day I had to call down to ask to have the room coffee rest ##ock ##ed . House ##keeping poor . When we first checked in and I called down from the room to ask if there was a re ##mo ##del ##ed room available as this one was in sad shape I was told all the rooms had just been re ##mo ##del ##ed . Um no ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo [SEP]
1	[CLS] great hotel and location and value . Staff was amazing ! ! ! Would stay there the next time in Chicago ! the con ##cier ##ge Cheryl was so helpful and the best ! The only thing about the hotel was that the star ##bu ##cks attached to it ( unsure if affiliated with the hotel ) was under ##sta ##ffed and had no food selection whatsoever [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were visiting our son for Memorial Day weekend and decided to stay at the Conrad because of prior stays at the old location . The new location is great , quiet neighborhood yet close to everything . R ##oof ##top bar was great , we had great weather the afternoon we hung out there . Our room was very nice , the Ultra King bed was extremely comfortable . Would highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is good , short walking distance to shopping and many sights . The room was modern and comfortable and the views of the lake and river were great . The service was what you expect at a first class hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a night in downtown Chicago . Hotel was very nice and clean . Their website shows no public parking but only if you ' re searching and they don ' t let you know that when booking so be prepared for the $ 60 daily v ##alet parking . The company doing the parking is terrible . Not friendly at all . waited 20 minutes to get my car and after one night there were din ##gs and scratch ##es . When we asked to file a complaint they were very rude and dismiss ##ive . I believe the v ##alet may be a third party not actually though the hotel . It ' s very unfortunate because the hotel itself and their staff were wonderful but if I ' m driving in I would never stay there again and have to deal with their garage . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A f ##abulous property with well appointed rooms . Line ##n , La ##n ##vin toilet ##ries and at ##ten ##tive service . Park ##ing is a steep $ 72 overnight . O ##uch . I ’ ll happily go back but this time just U ##ber . Great su ##shi restaurant Friends Su ##shi within a couple of blocks walking distance . Star ##bu ##cks very close . But the tea ##s in the lobby are a great touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is convenient ##ly located downtown . The area is beautiful . The staff are friendly and helpful . The hotel is clean and well maintained . The rooms are generous size and have everything you need . Thank you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and service . The hotel is not super modern , but recommend it and would glad ##ly come back . Staff is really nice and the door man outside the hotel bright ##ens up the whole hotel with his fantastic personality and smile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are heading to Chicago , the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is a classic hotel right in the heart of it all . Easy walking to Michigan avenue and the staff is friendly and helpful ! ! Over ##night v ##alet parking is available at a he ##fty $ 67 . We were able to leave our bags at the desk when we checked out and then pick up the car by 5 which was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The wife and I first time in Chicago . We loved the Ki ##nz ##e hotel . The room and atmosphere were fantastic . We enjoyed the lounge on the 6th floor . Josh was great . We went to the happy hour offered and when we went back the next time he not only remembered us . But remembered what we drank . Just all around excellent service . We will be back for sure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent experience , both in terms of quality of hotel and staff at ##ten ##tti ##ven ##ess ! The room was elegant and very comfortable . Clean ##nel ##iness is very important for my family and I - Conrad Chicago absolutely hit a home run ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful ##ly renovated intimate property in the city . Cool v ##ibes great staff Up ##graded to suite room and it was large with street views Beautiful bathroom with full tub and separate shower Co ##m ##fort ##able bed with lots of pillows [SEP]
0	[CLS] This property and their staff truly have your comfort and needs taken care of before you ask . What an incredible stay we have when we are there . The location is so central ##ly located it makes getting around much easier . I always look forward to my stays at this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are clean but smaller side . Our only shock was the overnight parking which was $ 67 per night . The hotel had a great location . The one across street was 48 but didn ’ t offer it to us . Staff was friendly and helpful . Great bell boys and bar keeps [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very professional and inform ##ative . The conference rooms were clean and always well prepared . Would recommend for business and / or pleasure . The con ##cier ##ge service was very helpful . The hotel restaurant and bar had excellent service and food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The welcome wasn ' t so warm and friendly as expecting in this class of hotel . We don ' t receive a heart ##y welcome when we arrived on Friday evening ; for example at the reception when we arrived , for the breakfast m ##or ##rn ##ing at the desk when we are waiting a long time for a v ##ou ##cher , in the dining - room and for the check - out . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can seriously say this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in , the service is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . My favorite part was the room , it was outstanding , and the bed was so comfortable , I can hardly sleep in mine now ! The entire hotel was spot ##less , and very well run . The location was also truly convenient in the midst of everything ! I really enjoyed the rooftop bar too . Do not hesitate to book awesome this hotel , I hope to return soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved at hotel around 1 ##pm and checking in early was not an issue . Check in was pro ##mpt and court ##eous . Room was on 6th floor and was average . View was terrible as it overlooked the roof of a neighboring building . Water was not very hot in the shower . Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tor was in the room and a tray is also provided for the morning continental breakfast . The breakfast by the elevator on each floor was a nice convenience . Co ##ck ##tails were available on the 6th floor every evening . Hotel is located in a convenient area with plenty of choices for restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No refrigerator in the room . Some parts of the room looked worn out . Staff was very helpful and friendly but room quality was just not there . For the same money I could ’ ve stayed somewhere nice ##r . Won ’ t be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First let me say I love the So ##fit ##el Brand . The others I have been to ( Fiji , Bangkok , etc ) are great and the service was excellent . This one just isn ’ t as good as the others I have been to but cost the same . The rooms are smaller , it has no pool , or in room f ##rig . The whole resident fee it is utterly ridiculous , and the hotels idea of an upgrade is moving you from floor 6 to for 12 but you get the exact same room , which to me isn ’ t an upgrade . As far as service the staff is great , checking in and out was smooth . I had a few p ##lum ##bing issues but were easily fixed quickly . So all in all not a bad stay but for the money you can go to one of the other downtown hotels and get a way better ( and much bigger ) room for the same money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A little generous here - pro ##b 3 . 5 / 5 . Very nicely decorated hotel in Art Dec ##o , lobby is beautiful . The location is excellent also , very near blue line to airport . A few issues - $ 6 for water in room ( two seven eleven ##s very close though ) - w ##if ##i was free but almost secretly - a note included with room keys - very noisy in the morning . From 8 : 30 onwards cleaner ##s banging doors and there was a dog barking one morning . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had an excellent stay at the Conrad Chicago . From the time I arrived the staff was very at ##ten ##tive and quick to respond to any needs . The hotel itself is well renovated and the food was exceptional . I would recommend staying here or hosting an event here if you ' re in the Chicago area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I picked this hotel for the price and location , and it was the perfect fit for my weekend touring the city of Chicago . I booked through a 3rd party and the process was sea ##m ##less . The location was close to shopping , restaurants , and local transportation . The service from the front desk to the door ##men / v ##alet was exceptional and they were always court ##eous and at ##ten ##tive . I didn ' t need to be wine ##d and din ##ed at a hotel - I just wanted a quiet , comfortable , and safe place to stay and sleep , this was the perfect fit . There ' s a local grocery / liquor store steps from this hotel and they carry E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING - - very convenient ! Will book here again while in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was staying here fi ##r a business conference fi ##r a few days , nice room , free coffee in the morning , nice breakfast . Great location fi ##r dining and shopping . A short walk to Michigan Ave stores . I ##ak Street stores , I ##ak Street beach and of course Rush street restaurants and bars . Reason ##able hotel . En ##joy [SEP]
0	[CLS] The proximity of this hotel makes it convenient for a stay . I ’ ve stayed at the hotel for a few different trips . It is nice but too expensive for what you get . The rooms are nice but getting dated . The carpet ##s are worn and you can tell the floors have been worked on because of the uneven ##ness . I believe there are better hotels for the value received . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing about this So ##fit ##el experience was less than top - notch . The property is well - appointed , and the room ( a king ) was very spacious . The amenities were excellent , from the gym to those provided in the bathroom . The staff were quite friendly , and there is no shortage of great restaurants , shops , and bars nearby ( but without making the area loud and party - central ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here 3 nights end of August for P ##J concerts at W ##rig ##ley Field . Pro ##s : Great location . Near the L . One block from the Chicago River . 2 blocks from Michigan Avenue . 3 blocks from millennium park . Close easy walk to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Art Institute , Navy Pier , etc . Close to lots of great food / drink options Great at ##ten ##tive staff A ##wes ##ome well appointed rooms Con ##s : No ##is ##y a . c if you ' re a light sleep ##er . Close enough to the L to hear whenever the brakes are applied . Would absolutely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got a great deal on this hotel and when we got there our expectations were greatly surpassed . The staff was amazing ##ly helpful and so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! From the clean ##liness to the cocktail hours they hosted we could not say enough good things about this hotel ! We will be staying here again for sure [SEP]
0	[CLS] My experience was amazing . Everybody was very polite and very helpful . Aside from this , the man who packed and un ##pack ##ed our luggage was very friendly the whole trip and every time he saw us would take time to talk to us . He gave us very good recommendations of things to do while in town and always had a smile . Everything was very clean and neat when we got there . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni hotels are always exactly what you expect them to be - outstanding . I always find the O ##m ##ni to be a quality hotel . They gave me a room on the top floor and the view was outstanding . Another per ##k - the food was delicious . Go O ##m ##ni ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco is located 1 block south of the Chicago River , 2 blocks off Michigan Ave ##nie . Si ##mp ##ly a wonderful location ! We could see the river and the Trump Hotel from our room . It was extremely comfortable , everything seemed new , and the service was excellent . I would stay here again in a minute . The only draw ##back is we that we found few restaurants nearby for breakfast . The hotel ' s restaurant was too fancy for us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here this past week for one night , very nice . The location is great and provided easy access to where I needed to go , just walked right across to A ##on Center . The rooms were clean and nice . Gorge ##ous views of downtown . Wonderful restaurant on site . Great staff . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed the Millennium Suite for three days . Room wasn ' t ready until 5 : 00 pm . The room itself was in poor condition , half of the sofa was missing so the " living area " was not usable . Fu ##rn ##iture was chip ##ped and overall beat - up . Pain p ##eal ##ing from the door , stain ##s on the curtains . V ##ER ##Y disappointed , as H ##ya ##tt typically has higher standards Note : Location is amazing , but there are other hotels nearby [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have a Lab so I enjoy Kim ##pton ' s dog friendly policy , but this time I did not travel with my dog and still stayed at Kim ##pton . Because of location in the Loop and $ 10 mini ##bar credit and free w ##if ##i and coffee in the lobby and happy hour ( which I missed ) . I just like the v ##ibe of their hotels and the bout ##ique feel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , beautiful property . Two things for a business travel ##er . . . After a long narrowing travel day , coming to a place where businesses surrounding are mostly closed + the restaurant not having room service is a minus . Second , the room had a dirty bath towel that either had make - up stain ##s that was kind of gross to deal with it and made me question the h ##y ##gie ##nic conditions ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent venue . Would highly recommend for a conference . The food was the only complaint I had . Not much of it and too expensive . The hotel is situated downtown and within walking distance of many restaurants , nightclub ##s and shopping centers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay overall . Great pool . Staff was very helpful . Room was comfortable and organized . The sight of the city for rooms facing was awesome . The higher up the better . Vale ##t was quick and easy , very welcoming group . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just got back from a three night stay here . My list of good things : great location ( close to shopping , river cruise , bus tours and restaurant / bar areas ) , very clean , reasonably priced , friendly & helpful staff , good sized rooms , free per ##ks such as : coffee / tea service in lobby , you can reserve the use of bikes , several choices of daily newspapers and an umbrella available in each room . Thanks Kim ##pton and thanks Chicago for a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hilton is a classic , beautiful old hotel . . . . at one time it was the flagship of the chain . The entrance foyer off of Michigan avenue is one of the most beautiful you will ever see . The triple elevator banks are great , even with a large conference going on , the elevators were never a wait . This is unusual since many hotels save money on elevators , thus making guests wait and waste time . The location is wonderful , within walking distance of a great many attractions and restaurants . Room ##s are quiet , clean and well designed . P ##ull your room blind ##s at night since the ' E ' design gives clear views into other guest rooms . It is a bit expensive , though I am cheap , others may consider the prices quite reasonable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel lobby and meeting rooms were nice , however , my room was in need of an upgrade - the material on the head ##board was literally p ##eel ##ing off . Also , the drain in the tub did not hold water . Besides needing up ##dating , the room was functional , included a coffee maker , robe & safe . W ##if ##i worked well . Staff was helpful & efficient . There is a C ##VS across the street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great trip my wife and I had for the weekend . We reside in Texas and were in Chicago on business ( pleasure ) and truly enjoyed the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal as well as the site seeing . I highly recommend the architectural boat tour of downtown , it was awesome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Right off Michigan Avenue , the O ##m ##ni deal we found on Travel ##zo ##o got us a great rate plus $ 20 a day for meals . The hotel restaurant was so good we ate breakfast there every morning and had dinner one of the four nights we were in town . The room was very good ( we had a small suite ) in all ways . No rooftop bar but there is a good one at the Conrad just a block away . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We did a 3 day get ##away as a Christmas present . You can tell they put $ 170 million in restoring it . The lobby had a choir singing . And what a lobby ! Great to meet and drink . The rooms were spacious , clean and very no ##stal ##gic . Pictures lined the hallway ##s , and what hallway ##s . I believe it has 1 , 300 rooms , so they have a few hallway ##s . Everything you need , and great service . Good prices as well . Go and stay at some history . [SEP]
0	[CLS] To whom it may concern , I wanted to let you know of the sea ##m ##less service we received from our check in agent at the time we arrived at your hotel for our I ##EC ##A event , his name was Bart ##ek Ku ##lson . He truly went above and beyond to cater to our every need , even w ##him ! We had a lot going on that couple of nights we stayed . And he made sure with our many demands , that he would take care of each detail , as he did ! Because of people like Bart ##ek , our company wants to return time and time again to your establishment . Please let him know of our gratitude for his outstanding customer service !

1	[CLS] Beautiful Historic Hotel located near shopping , museums , parks and many restaurants and bars . The Hotel was beautiful . The rooms were a bit small especially the wash ##rooms . But very clean and comfortable . Would definitely stay there again . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Palmer May have been a good hotel in the past but not is over ##p ##rice ##d f ##o what the offer . De ##fin ##ite ##ly need some cleaning , re ##mo ##del ##ing and renovation ! El ##eva ##tor very slow and for the most part didn ’ t stop at our floor . The first room they gave us smelled so like b ##lea ##ch we had to change rooms . Second room had old carpet broken mirror , c ##log ##ged tub . . . . i can go on . There are p ##ics of our room attached to this review . No room service in the evening ( guess they had it just few h ##rs a day ) De ##fin ##ite ##ly will not stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had the good fortune to stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand in Chicago during a recent business trip . Thankfully , there was time to enjoy the city . . . and what can I say ? Fantastic . . . . everyone from the front desk to the housekeeper ##s was polite . Best of all , the door ##men went out of their way to make sure we had accurate directions , etc . In particular - Mike ( I failed to get his last name ) sent us to a local pizza place ( Pi ##zano ' s ) - exceptional deep dish pizza , the best I ' ve ever eaten . His recommendations were all spot - on . On the day I checked out , John Tri ##til ##li went out of his way to make sure my trip to the airport was on - time . These two gentlemen are great ambassador ##s for the hotel and the city . I will be back - next time , no business , just vacation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am sitting up at midnight with the windows open to try to cool the room down from 76 degrees ! The hotel is on ‘ heat mode ’ so that ’ s pretty much all you can do as per the ‘ friendly staff ’ ! All I can say is avoid this place ! I regularly spend 100 + nights a year in hotels and have have pretty low expectations , but this takes the cake ! - A Hilton Honors Diamond member [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the So ##fit ##el Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile from April 26 till the 29 . Because of a confusion in a phone reservation , we had to pay for 3 nights from March 26 till 29 because the person did not type right . This is why , as a nice compensation we were offered on April 26 when we really had our stay , 3 breakfast v ##ou ##chers for 2 . We gave these v ##ou ##chers when our check came with a nice T ##IP in cash . The waiter ##s always said the breakfast would be at no cost . At check out , these 3 breakfast were automatically charged to my credit card in file . . . It would be nice if these charges could be re ##im ##bur ##sed on the same credit card ? Feel free to call me at any time at : 06 14 28 28 30 Eric Hermann [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions expensive for value received . Co ##st of lunch and breakfast very expensive go meal that was just OK . CO ##NC ##IE ##R ##GE staff excellent . Front desk staff inadequate to handle and process easy requests . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This a lovely hotel with a great location . Gold Coast is such a unique neighborhood , close to the lake and walk ##able for shopping , coffee shops and restaurants . The rooms are on the large size and I could actually see the the lake from my room . What really sets this place apart is the amazing front desk staff ! I travel a lot and it is rare to encounter hotel staff that genuinely cares about your needs . B ##re at the front desk went above and beyond to accommodate a few of my requests and always did so with a smile , this is what makes a great hotel stay for me and I will be back on account of the amazing service I received . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed four days a the Home ##wood Suite ##s and were more than satisfied with our experience . The hotel was central ##ly located within walking distance of most attractions we had planned to visit . The rooms were well appointed , the staff was very at ##ten ##tive and the place was spot ##less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about this stay was first class ! Here are a few things that we just loved ! Service - everyone we encountered went out of their way to deliver friendly and welcoming service . We wanted to recognize Eric , for replacing our granddaughter ' s " Conrad the bear " when she lost it . He was so un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly professional and made us feel so welcome when walking in the front door ! Room - oversized , clean and comfortable . Love ##d everything about it - one of our favorites to date ! Location - right next to Michigan Avenue - couldn ' t ask for a more convenient location . I can ' t even imagine any of the reviews that left less than 5 stars . This was such a memorable stay - you will not be disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , location , location ! Was so happy that we had a view of Michigan Ave and everything was so close ! We were able to walk everywhere and it was so fun exploring the city with our hotel being at the center of it . The rooms were clean and the bathroom ##s are spectacular , was super happy with the hospitality and the staff . Was always greeted prior to entering and exiting the hotel and everyone was genuinely in a good mood . Can ’ t wait to go back to Chicago to stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] i enjoyed my stay at your hotel for my conference . the rooms are comfortable and large . the food was excellent . i really enjoyed the pool . what an extra to have such a beautiful pool that is 25 yards long . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we stayed for 2 nights in April . The hotel is just off the lake ##front and very convenient for the main street where all the shops were . I now know why it ' s called the Wind ##y City . Good size rooms , everything you needed in it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time at this location of Home ##wood Suite ##s . The rooms were clean and good sized , the location is great . Breakfast was very good with changes made daily . The best part was the staff ! From the v ##alet / bell ##man to the front desk and breakfast staff along with house ##keeping and sales department - all were FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C ! Thank you for the perfect stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] So for Star Wars Celebration in Chicago 2019 , I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights . At first I was not excited by the idea of having to take a bus back and forth from McCormick Place to the hotel , even if the bus was offered compliment ##ary by the convention . It wasn ' t a big has ##sle after all was said and done . I stayed in a 2 full / queen sized bed room with my family and that provided just enough space . I liked the large sized closet ##s and we had a view of the river facing west towards the " co ##bb buildings " There was plenty of room in the lobby and we even ordered some G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s and ate in the open space close to the bar . Overall it was a nice stay and especially considering the convention price of $ 159 per night . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is easy to get drawn into because of the beautiful lobby area , but as soon as you get to the room , you ’ ll want to leave . After getting to my second requested room , I decided to leave and stay elsewhere . The first room was must ##y and felt dirty . The toilet was running and the AC barely worked . In the second room , the wall ##paper was falling off the walls and my bathroom light didn ’ t work . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not up to any standards of mine , although the front desk staff was very helpful and friendly , and gave me a re ##fu ##nd , no questions asked . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying at the Talbot ##t and I ' m positive it will not be our last . The room , staff , restaurant and other amenities were all great . D ##wayne ( door ##man ) is an asset to this establishment ! In Chicago twice a year or more and we ' ll be back at the Talbot ##t soon . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was here for a work weekend and the hotel was great . The location was perfect , it ’ s clean , and very professional staff . I recommend this whenever you are in the city . There ’ re are also many great restaurants close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here a number of times and it is always very good . Caroline at the front desk and Mike at the door were both very friendly and helpful . The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very quiet . The gym is small but sufficient if you are not going for a run along the lake . The restaurant is not overly expensive and the bar is welcoming . Stay there for the quiet rooms , friendly service , and excellent location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel staff and amenities were simply World Class ! ! Made my Chicago Marathon weekend experience all the more memorable ! ! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have the experience of a lifetime in Chicago ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This lovely bout ##ique hotel is in a wonderful location . It is within walking distance to great restaurants and all the sites . Public transportation is easily accessible as well . We stayed in a suite and I slept on the sofa bed which was surprisingly comfortable . I was a bit worried about traffic noise but the windows are thick and sound was muted . The staff was helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was in a great location and easy walking distance to the shops , restaurants , lake and key attractions . The room was small , which is expected for a city hotel . However it was clean and had everything we needed . The hotel itself is very traditional and decorated in line with its tradition . The corridors , could do with up ##dating as they appeared tired and in need of some t ##l ##c . The majority of the staff were helpful and friendly and gave us some good tips on where to visit / eat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family was in Chicago for sights ##ee ##ing and one business meeting for daughter . Home ##wood suites are the answer for privacy for three people . The hotel was in a great location for shopping and eating . Trade ##r Joe ’ s was two blocks away and Whole Foods was a fifteen minutes walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been staying at this hotel each year during a major trade show for 9 years . There is a reason I keep coming back . Except ##ional ups ##cale accommodation ##s , professional and helpful staff and nice benefits during the stay , including l ##us ##cious continental breakfast with great coffee and past ##ries . Re ##ception every night at 5 - 7 with fine cheese ##s , meat , etc . when you check in they give you coins you . An use for free drinks including Wood ##ford Reserve , wine , beer , etc . The staff is the real joy of your stay . Great environment for relaxing after a day on the floor at McCormick Place . En ##joy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 2 Room Suite for the price of a small room . Friendly , competent staff . Quick ##est bell service I ' ve ever had . Great location . Clean , bright , modern . Not a single complaint and I and my lady friend generally find something to k ##vet ##ch about . I ' d stay here again in a heartbeat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker on July 2nd , the same day we were married 50 years ago . T ##iara , the con ##cier ##ge , couldn ' t have been sweet ##er . She helped make our two day visit really special . We had a suite on the 11th . floor which had a great bathroom including a tub that had jets and felt delicious . There was no wedding on that Sunday , but a really sweet Serbian guy who worked security , opened the ballroom for us , turned on the lights , and let us take pictures . Monday night , thanks to T ##iara , we had drinks at the bar , and the bartender was one of the sweet ##est guys ever . It ' s a great location , short walk to the beach , Oak Street , and all of the great shops . The hotel has a co ##zy feel to it and the staff is just the best ! ! ! ! Thanks T ##iara ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel . Great setting . Very friendly and competent staff . Guest room was very nicely furnished and in good condition . Bed was excellent . Room was nice and quiet . Food was excellent in St ##ets ##on ' s and the banquet meals were also very good . Staff was friendly and welcoming [SEP]
1	[CLS] I made terrible mistake by not reading reviews prior to staying this past weekend . I have to say not a good experience . Room was the worst . Si ##ze - - we had king del ##uxe that was a queen squeezed into small room . . . furniture was too big for the room . Room was like closet . . The worst though was the walls . We could hear everything through the walls . . . we knew our neighbors names by the end of the weekend . Their alarm woke us up . People at front really didn ' t care . Also this was bad thing for us was elevator went down all day Sunday . . Had to wait way to long . Also don ' t forget parking . . . $ 59 . 00 per night . For what we paid it was not worth the price . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was in Chicago on a little get away when I had arrived to the hotel there was a big confusion with my reservation . Leah R at the front desk took ownership of what happened she didn ’ t just say to bad . She made me feel as though I was about of her family and treated me with such love . She fixed my problem with such professional ##ism and quick ##ness so that I would not be out of a place to stay . I know that the next time I come back to Chicago I ’ m going to stay at the Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro not only because it is an awesome hotel with a great staff and a beautiful atmosphere but mostly because of the experience I had with her and because she showed genuine concern about me and my experience in the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel , the beds are so ##oo ##o comfortable ! ! Would stay there again in a heartbeat ! Only one negative point is the check in and check out line - way too long . Had to wait about 20 - 30 minutes in line to check in and check out . Other than that , awesome hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My boyfriend and I stayed at the Conrad Hotel in downtown Chicago early March and had a wonderful stay . Our guest service re ##p accommodate ##d our request to stay on a higher floor and away from an elevator . She also con ##gra ##tu ##lated us on our anniversary . Not only did she con ##gra ##tu ##late us but went above and beyond surprising us with champagne and a hand written note . Thanks to Ali ##na the Conrad will always be our first choice when we stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a nice hotel located in a great location in downtown Chicago . The hotel is right down the street from local shops and restaurants . The staff was nice . The hotel was clean . I would consider staying at this location again . [SEP]

0	[CLS] We visited Chicago to return our daughter to school for the semester and luck ##ed into this g ##em of a hotel . The staff was fantastic , always friendly and welcoming . The check - in process was quick and smooth and the accommodation ##s were second to none - com ##fy beds and a really spacious room . This q ##ua ##int hotel is within a quick walk to Water Tower Place so it ’ d be a fantastic choice for shop ##pers looking to brows ##e the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . I heart ##ily recommend this establishment and we will certainly be returning ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Even for Downtown Chicago the traffic was ho ##rre ##ndo ##us ! Upon arriving , I had to drive around the block several times in order to pull into the v ##alet service area . The staff apologized for the back up and worked very hard to [SEP]
1	[CLS] Of course the layout of a hotel room , the view etc are huge ##ly impact ##ful with respect to one ' s enjoyment of a hotel but for me NO ##TH ##ING beats the hospitality , kindness and g ##rac ##ious ##ness of the people that work in the hotel . V ##es ##mir ( the Bell ##man ) and Jo ##i ( Front ##des ##k ) went 200 % out of their way to assist me and make sure my stay here was perfect . These are the people you want representing your business because they assure customers are going to come back and tell everyone they know where to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect Location . Lu ##x ##ury to the nine ##s . Room ##s are very spacious and clean . Staff is very friendly . G ##reet ##ed at the door every time I go in and out of the hotel . Continental breakfast with hot eggs and bacon was great for the one day they did it . ( Hope they continue with it ) David S . In the restaurant went above and beyond with his hospitality . Thank you for great stay Conrad Staff . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The best O ##m ##ni I ' ve stayed at . We ' ll be back ! The gentlemen at the door service were helpful and friendly . Before I arrived , Justin , my ambassador reached out to make sure the week went well . The location is excellent , walking distance to Looking ##glass theater and many popular places . I was working and it was close to the Booth School campus - my destination each day . Hot coffee at my door each morning - a great hotel in a great city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a wonderful hotel . However , it was very high priced . There were many things going on in Chicago this weekend . Hotel rooms were hard to find . I have nothing negative to say about the hotel . Everyone was very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff is wonderful , and hotel is great . Can ' t beat the location , and had a can ' t - be - beat view of the Chicago River and W ##rig ##ley building from the room . Try the ribs at the bar for good food ! Overall this was a wonderful experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall my stay was good The beds were clean and comfortable . Hidden up ##chs ##rges I called to call the front desk for ice Coffee was only compliment ##ary from 6 ##am - 11 ##am Close walk to store and eat ##ery Thanks [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had two rooms in this hotel . It was a grand hotel , good quality and very friendly , helpful staff . We were a short walk from Navy Pier , Mile ##nn ##ium Park and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Used the Big Bus Hop on Hop Off to get around to places like the She ##dd aquarium and the Planet ##arium . The bus stop was right outside the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in room 101 ##0 for a long weekend . The room had views of Navy Pier and the lake ( even though a building blocked some of the views ) . The beds were very comfortable and the room and bathroom were a good size for a downtown hotel . The room had mini ##bar ( which I have not seen in a while ) . The closet was also a decent size . I did not notice any noise from surrounding rooms or the hallway . Even thought the hotel is very large , the common areas and elevators did not feel crowded . The pool and fitness area are well appointed and very nice . As with most downtown hotels , the overnight parking is price ##y although the hotel does have self parking which is slightly less expensive . Were we able to walk to restaurants and Navy Pier within 15 minutes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I normally stay at Virgin Hotels but this came up and I will forever love this hotel ! Amazing river ##front views . Along with very co ##zy bed , kept me warm during the Chicago cold ##ness . Nice big TV with a good channel selection and close to all of the major shopping areas in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] We met Nik ##ko during our stay last week . He was very friendly , nice to talk to and gave us advise on where to din ##e . The hotel is clean , nice staff & beautifully located near Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . We couldn ’ t be happier with our room , we even have a Ke ##uri ##g coffee machine ! Nowadays , some hotels don ’ t even have coffee machine ! We will recommend this hotel and will stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Swiss ##ote ##l and had a wonderful experience , starting with check - in with Nicole . She was so pleasant and made me feel so welcome . Had a beautiful room with a view of Lake Michigan . Bed was quite comfortable , room the ##rm ##ost ##at kept the temperature just where I wanted it , and the shower was great . Swiss ##ote ##l is convenient ##ly located to many downtown attractions , I would highly recommend . Just one thing to be careful of , if you plug the address into your GPS unit , it will take you to Lower W ##ack ##er Drive and you want to be on Upper W ##ack ##er Drive . [SEP]

0	[CLS] This hotel is historic and looks amazing . It has a great location on State St but looks doesn ’ t cut it . It ’ s the small things and the service that makes a stay enjoyable . I had several issues during my stay and it was like pulling teeth to get them resolved . Would not stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A te ##rri ##fic location ! So close to State Street shopping and to the theaters . The room was spacious and the bed so comfortable . The staff was friendly and the lobby was f ##estive . It was perfect for our holiday girls weekend . [SEP]

1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed here twice now . Just back from long weekend break . Re ##ception staff very friendly and helpful . Even upgraded to junior suites for my wife ' s birthday . Maybe not always possible . Paul the con ##cier ##ge was great , for reservations . Room cleaned to high standard every morning , never required anything . To ##we ##ls etc . Spot ##less clean . As for the location ? Un ##beat ##able . Michigan mile 1 ##min to the left , beach 5 min ##s , navy pier 15 - 20 . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]

1	[CLS] I stayed three nights with a group at this location . The rooms were clean and noise was at a minimum . The breakfast b ##uff ##et is wonderful and complete with made - to - order o ##mel ##ettes . I asked one morning about o ##at ##me ##al and within five minutes it was delivered to my table . The door ##keepers are very " on " with helping guests . It was a good location to go shopping or out to eat or to catch a taxi . I definitely would stay at this location again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a wonderful example of excellence . The service in the Potter ' s Chicago Burger Bar the night we stayed was very shaky , but the the rest of the staff was excellent . I highly recommend Palmer House ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is slightly removed from " tourist central " so the noise is reduced but still very close by and within walking distance to many must sees . Staff is court ##eous and hotel room was exceptionally clean . Breakfast is good too in lobby restaurant . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel and the service ! We came for a weekend get ##away trip due to the pan ##de ##mic eating away at our mental health , and we felt super safe coming here . The front desk workers were super helpful and amazing , and everything was set up so well around the pan ##de ##mic . Everything was sa ##ni ##tized and clean , and we barely had any contact with guests or workers . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I came to Chicago for a log weekend after a busy few months . We had a problem with our room and Cass ##ara handled it professionally and personally . We were moved to a new room . I highly recommend the Hilton Chicago [SEP]
0	[CLS] My friend booked a room at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for business and decided to have me over for dinner . I went to the front desk to ask if there was water to purchase . Ra ##ul Villa ##rre ##al was very helpful and even gave some recommendations for some things to visit in the area . All in all , his hospitality and warm smile made the stay even that much better . Thanks Ra ##ul ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] We very much enjoyed our stay at the Fair ##mont Chicago last week . Everyone on the staff went above and beyond to be sure that we were comfortable and happy . Sharon in the Gold Lounge was exceptionally helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel all around was very nice E ##X ##CE ##P ##T there was a loud banging noise at 5 : 45 ##am that lasted on and off for quite a long time . I actually took a video so they could hear how loud it was . I did tell the front reception desk about this but they didn ' t really seem to care that much and just apologized . For paying almost 300 . 00 for the room , I would have expected a little more customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved my stay - - was easy walk to shopping . Was connected to my business meeting . Any ##time I had a need , be it for more s ##ham ##po ##o , directions to dinner , a ride to church on Ash Wednesday , a bottle opened . It was provided kindly and promptly . Check in and check out were incredibly smooth . There was a big conference , so hallway ##s were a little loud a couple of times , but mostly quiet , and beds were comfortable . It was a great location and great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here two years ago . It ’ s improved . Clean . Friendly staff . Good location . Restaurant is so - so . G ##rab and go is just ok . But large rooms . But could never get cool at night . Very hot always . Even w windows open . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Was in town for business and the hotel managed our rather large group incredibly well . I would definitely return here with my family for vacation . The hotel is well located . Breakfast in the dining room was incredibly good ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a family wedding in the city , very polite staff and extremely helpful . Close to many sights ##ee ##ing all within walking distance or fast taxi service . After check ##out and before leaving for the airport they held our bags for us ( very convenient since our flight was not leaving for another 7 hours ) . Would recommend this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is very clean and the staff is great . It is located in a perfect location to get to everything around . Easy for U ##ber pick ##ets and the bar has excellent drinks and the food was very good . The cleaning crew actually cleaned the room when you left for the day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] She ##rato ##n grand Chicago is what you would expect from the She ##rato ##n brand . However , it is the staff over there who really stand out , from the house ##keeping staff to the reception staff to De ##met ##rius at con ##cier ##ge to Connie who works the evening shift at the club lounge . They really go out of their way to make you comfortable . Connie has been working in the club lounge in this She ##rato ##n hotel for 20 years and she treats you more like an honored personal guest rather than just a hotel patron . Overall we were very impressed with the customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful old hotel . Some rooms with f ##abulous views of Lake Michigan . Location is ideal for for being Close to downtown , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Grant Park , Buckingham Fountain , State St and Michigan Ave shopping and restaurants . The Hotel restaurant has excellent food also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is ideal ##ly located in the heart of the city , in the middle of all theaters , and walking distance to the millennium park . Its style echoes the past of the city and provides good v ##ibes for the visitor . Room ##s are small but easily forgive ##n since well arranged . What is less for ##gi ##ving however is the fact you have to wait for 20 m ##n to get a lift to the lobby , the charge ##able w ##if ##i ( unless you have an I ##H ##G membership , but it does not work fl ##aw ##lessly ) , and lack of compliment ##ary amenities : neither bottle of water , nor tea bag in your room unless you ' re willing to spend $ 6 . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay in Chicago and price is good compared to other options . Park ##ing is not the best , but it ' s not good anywhere in Chicago . I love the evening free food and drinks , as well as the free breakfast , pool and super big rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a business oriented hotel with good meeting rooms , etc . We were on a spring break trip with a 10 year old . The hotel rooms and service were very good , the pool and other f ##ac ##ili ##tes good as well . The location of around a mile or so from many at ##ta ##ctions is good as well , as Tax ##i service was excellent . The only draw - back with this hotel is with the dining . While the cafe ' s were nice , they all closed at 2 : 00 ##pm and were not open for dinner . The only on property option was a Shu ##las . Not a good place for kids or any casual dining . That might be OK , but there are no casual restaurants less than a mile away . Fortunately , the room service was excellent and ( for a change ) priced right . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel needs re ##mo ##del ##ing and up ##dating . We were there with a group for NY ##E party . . . and boy what a huge disappointment . We paid extra for VIP tickets and the event was nothing as described . The hotel staff had little knowledge of the entire event . We will not return to the Swiss ##ote ##l and we would not recommend staying there ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fair ##mont Mill ##eni ##um Park has an outstanding Gold Floor . Gold in service , Gold in presentation , Gold in views overlooking the lake and Mill ##eni ##um Park .

Another special T ##HA ##N ##K YOU to Cody Cook , Fair ##mont Gold Manager [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only issue we had was room was not cleaned . We left at noon and returned at 5 . Called house ##keeping . They said they would be by . We fell asleep waiting until 5 : 30 . Called again , they said we were on the list . We told them we needed to get ready for dinner . Show ##ered with dirty towels . They cleaned while we were gone for the evening . No one really apologized . Otherwise , service and hotel very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay overall , great people , and te ##rri ##fic location - but the furniture and bed ' s head ##board needs replacing . The service is second to none , and friend ##liest staff in Chicago . Look forward to staying there again if they fix the furniture . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 2 nights in January . Love ##d the classic feel of the hotel which was a re ##f ##reshing change from the large chain hotels I normally stay at . Location is great - central and close to shops and restaurants . Room was on the small size but that is to be expected in an older building . Room was quiet . Would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price I paid I was expecting more . Room ##s were out ##dated and worn out . There was a nice view but that was about it . Staff could have been friend ##lier . Too noisy throughout the night . Also , my key card kept acting up ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t for the NBA All Star Weekend last month ( Feb 2020 ) and of course the hotel was very busy , having around a thousand people during the day . This didn ' t mean the hotel had any issues with their service , seemed like they were always prepared for big conventions like this one . The rooms were a bit dark and out - dated but everything else were great . had a lot of food options and also had a bar . The best thing about this is they had a 24 ##hr convenience store / market on the ground floor so you can get your snack ##s / food anytime of the day . It also had a Star ##bu ##cks in it which is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] K ##wa ##me checked me in - - he saw that I stayed here previously and gave me a f ##abulous upgrade ! Bravo . F ##abulous customer service . Spa ##cious suite , great , huge bathroom , quiet ( ! ) , clean . And when I checked out , everyone was very kind , pleasant , not rushed in terms of turning customers over . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not worth the money . The location and view are great but the staff is s ##not ##ty and not cooperative and the rooms were dirty and dated . The pillows were like giant sand bags from gym class . I will never stay there again and i was looking forward to a fancy stay . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not the case [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for business this week , and it was a beautiful hotel with a fantastic view of the lake and river ! Outstanding customer service , very clean hotel . The bed ##ding wasn ' t the best ( a bit hard ) , and I was disappointed there was no room to use the fridge for personal food ( it was fully stock ##ed ) ; otherwise it was a great room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First , the hotel reservation was made on the phone . The man helping me make a decision was extremely helpful in looking for any and all discount ##s possible . Then he made sure to make note that we were visiting for my husband ' s birthday . When we checked in , the front desk was extremely friendly and welcoming . She upgraded us without us asking , to a suite for my husband ' s birthday . It was a very nice room and amazing location . Very happy with the clean ##liness , the convenience , and the hospitality . Could not be happier ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed Club Room to have access to club lounge and free w ##if ##i . While this hotel is well positioned with a comfortable bed that ’ s about where it ends . The club lounge is the worst I have been in and during happy hour 5 to 8 the ni ##bble ##s are minimal and if you want a glass of wine or beer you have to pay for it . The lounge environment is old and sadly in need of re ##furbishment . Lounge breakfast is a joke . On checking out I found I had been charged for w ##if ##i although included in club package - they did reverse but quite frankly you don ’ t need this type of has ##sle from what is meant to be a good hotel . I wouldn ’ t stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights as a family - really excellent hotel . Staff were welcoming and helpful - and all facilities were as described on website - or better . The staff at breakfast were particularly brilliant - as was the food . Location and quality could not be better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room location was excellent - best view of Michigan Ave and Bridge . Service is good at Michael Jordan ’ s bar . Star ##bu ##cks is just in front of door ! Hotel pillows are too soft for me but you can ask manager for foam ones . Clean rooms and nice selection of mini bar ! I advised parking off site on Grand Ave as it will save you $ 20 + as compared to v ##alet . Fun night ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I made a quick trip to the Wind ##y City at the end of July and stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . It was the most economical hotel close to the river but did not lack on luxury We enjoyed our compliment ##ary cocktail ##s in their on location bar , had one of the most comfortable sleep ##s in a hotel and the staff was incredible ! Their con ##ten ##ential breakfast was amazing - everything you could possibly need or want . We did have an issue with our room the second night but they were there to help in a matter of minutes to relocate us . Thank you Ki ##nz ##ie for a great get ##away ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d this hotel . Great location , amenities and service . Free w ##if ##i , continental breakfast in the morning right on the floor of your room along with compliment ##ary happy hour each night with 2 free drinks all fantastic per ##ks not found in larger hotel chains . Con ##cier ##ge staff friendly and helpful with questions about the area . Location is ideal for sight seeing - walking distance to She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , Art Institute , Navy Pier , Mill ##eni ##um Park , and the Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile . Count ##less amazing restaurants within walking vicinity . Will definitely be back and will stay at Ki ##nz ##ie again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were very small . Door ##s rattled , walls were thin and neighbors were loud . Clean ##liness was sub ##par - bath ##tub ##s were stained and dirty , sink did not drain . There were bugs on the curtains by the windows . W ##if ##i was difficult to use and didn ' t always work . Hotel guest service staff was spectacular and location was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was at the Swiss ##ote ##l several weeks ago after being out of the country . I had issues with my card coming back but the woman at the front desk was incredible with helping me check in . Her name was Ruth and she was so ho ##sp ##ita ##ble and clearly cared about her job . I could not have asked for a better experience in such a stress ##ful time . She had a line of guests trying to check in but she had such a positive attitude the entire time . I was beyond impressed as someone who travels and as someone who works in hotels . I also had a pleasant experience with a bartender . She was short and blonde and I do not remember her name but she was very at ##ten ##tive and up ##beat . I will 100 % return and recommend this hotel to others because of the staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in Chicago for business and wanted a hotel downtown . This hotel is in a great location and close to many great steak houses . I think there is a little up charge for a river view , but I think it is worth it . The rooms tend to run a little small . I don ' t think they are close to the advertised 300 + sq ##ft . I think they are more like 200 to 250 sq ##ft . Overall , it is a very nice hotel for the money and for shorter stays . One thing that didn ' t go well is their W ##i - Fi . For some reason , I had no luck . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The restaurant is being renovated , and the windows along W ##aba ##sh on the north side of the hotel give the appearance that the hotel is either empty or under construction . The lobby / gathering area where the wine and coffee are served was small but clean . The rooms were expected ##ly small and eclectic , but the condition was not quite to the same level as the other Kim ##pton hotels in Chicago . The rooms were very clean , but there was some water damage in the bathroom at the base ##boards , but it didn ' t effect the functionality . The location is great for the River ##walk and for pleasant walks around the north loop . It ' s worth another visit . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first time at this location ! But many times at other Hilton properties in Chicago ! First class , will return and looking forward to enjoy all the great ##ness of this hotel . Thank you Conrad Hilton [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just wanted to write a note thank ##ing Rosemary from the house ##keeping staff for all of her help in re ##sol ##ving two minor issues with my room ! Not only was she helpful , but her positive presence is an asset to the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has a ton of history through the lobby and ball rooms . It may be time for some up ##dating . I am Hilton Honors and was put in room 56 ##5 . With a view of the rock roof and another building across an alley I think . This hotel is one where most of the room configurations differ by room . The bathroom was very small but up to date . The bed faced the bathroom and the TV was near the night stand on the right . So , I can watch TV laying on my side . It was cold in the morning so I turned up the heat to find I could not turn it down once it warmed up . Could barely read the display and a cow ##or ##ker traveling with me could not get the heat to go up above 65 . The hotel is in a great location but just needs some real care compared to the newer hotel in the same area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best place for a conference . There are a number of places to eat in the area . The staff are very helpful they want you to have the best stay possible . Over night parking is very expensive , There is plenty of fun to be had in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were at a different hotel that was across town and stayed here the second night . It was such an upgrade . Clean and nice accommodation ##s . The location was wonderful , 5 min walk from one of the " beaches . " The only down ##side was the price to park which was outrage ##ous , as are all the hotels in Chicago . We parked in a garage across the street for about 20 dollars less , but had an issue with them the next morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel stay was great . It was host hotel for the race I was doing . Room was nice and clean . Free W ##i ##F ##i . Quiet . There were a couple restaurants on ##site though I didn ’ t use them . There was a grab n go in the hotel had some ordering of food like pizza and sandwiches . Lots of choices and Star ##bu ##cks coffee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in the hotel for a wonderful weekend in Chicago . It was an absolutely beautiful hotel , nice staff and comfortable bed . The rooms are a bit small and there is no room service or pool but other than that a nearly perfect experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff were excellent ! From the moment we arrived everyone was very friendly , welcoming and helpful ! We received an upgrade to our room , and the room was beautiful with a great view ! My son enjoyed climbing in the windows to see outside . He did get sick in the bed a couple of times and the staff response to the situation was quick and did not make us feel bad at all , very understanding . The house ##keeping staff kept the room fresh , clean and welcoming . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great place to stay with the nice ##st people making sure you have everything you need . Jane , D ##wayne , and Charles make you feel like family . I had issues with the parent company Reservation Contact Center but when I called the local Talbot ##t front desk - - Jane correct all issues and made sure I was completely satisfied . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago . The staff was friendly and helpful . The rooms were clean and had all the amenities that I needed . House keeping was pro ##mpt and did a good job . The food at the conference in the hotel , that I attended was good quality and taste . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was booked at the Conrad through business and had low expectations . It was great ! Up ##sca ##le . Large rooms . Book ##ed accessible room and it was perfect for my wheelchair to get around . The location was just off Michigan and perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience ! Though they over ##charged me for w ##if ##i they more than made it up with free services . The location is great ! Near the miracle mile , rail , the harbor , and on the river . Great views as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My cow ##or ##ker and I are nurses currently assigned at McCormick Place on the Co ##vid - 19 unit . After a long shift we decided to stay downtown and not drive back to the suburbs . We called ahead to check in . Ask ##ed if we can get a room on a higher floor with a view , I did mention we ' re nurses . Upon walking into our room we were pleasant ##ly surprised that they upgraded us to a gorgeous suite on the 31st floor . Very clean , huge , 2 bathroom suite with a view . Great service and friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room wasn ' t clean . Not was the elevator lobby on my floor . No energy in this hotel . Re ##ception on 3rd floor . Restaurant on 4 . Bad lay out . Room for . Y conference was too small and tables too small . Great location , but I ' ve stayed in much better Chicago hotels for this price . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 3 nights here during the labour day long weekend . The staff was very court ##eous , rooms were cleaned properly and we were given station ##aries everyday . The room was spacious and the view from our hotel room was awesome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Though I arrived way ahead of check ##in time they were kind enough to let me have a room ( it was a gods ##end after a red ##eye flight ) . Staff very friendly and helpful . Great atmosphere of hotel . Nice touch with the happy hour in lobby every afternoon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came for a weekend get ##away with friends and decided to go for the inter ##con because of the location and prestige of the hotel . We stayed at room 1900 which was nice and clean , as well as the rest of the hotel . The team were also nice and polite . Issues we had : There are sire ##ns sounds and people noise from the street . All day and night . Li ##teral ##ly , we couldn ’ t get a decent rest . The spa is very me ##dio ##cre and the swimming pool was closed without informing the guests in advance . While the swimming pool issue is temporary , the noise doesn ’ t go away . Take it into account - perhaps ask for a room facing the other side of the magnificent mile . If you ’ re planning on spa treatment , you ’ re better off elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are small but pretty typical of Chicago bout ##ique hotels . The bathroom is very small with no counter space . Not as typical from my experience . The elevator situation is very slow if it ' s mid morning during check ##out time . Overall , the amenities were very nice . The best selling point is the nice , quiet neighborhood , that is still a quick walk to great restaurants and shipping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are im ##ma ##culate . The food in the restaurant / bar is sa ##vor ##y and the staff are focused on service . Cody Chen and Josh were especially helpful . Charles and others were great with baggage , directions & transportation . Wonderful location . Good value . We ##l ##coming . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location of this hotel for business or leisure . Room ##s are fresh and modern , the price we paid was truly a good value for the city . I would stay here again and would not hesitate to recommend it to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##VO ##ID ST ##A ##Y ##ING H ##ER ##E . I stayed here for 1 night We ##d 9 / 20 and woke up scratching intensely . I was bit 9 times by bed bugs over the 6 hours I slept here . Room 60 ##9 is an accessible room and I would hate for anyone with any issues to have to wake up with this nightmare . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this hotel at the last minute on Tri ##va ##go . Got a great price compared to other hotels in the area . The front desk service was excellent . There really isn ' t a lobby , but it came with a free breakfast and a free happy hour drink . The room was really nice and compared well to more expensive hotels in the area . Bath ##room was really nice and had a seating stool with a ma ##gni ##fying lit mirror to put on makeup which I really liked . The room also had an umbrella in the closet and very nice plus ##h robes . Only complaint is that currently there is construction going on near the cross street of the hotel and the nose at 8 ##am was loud as I was on the 2nd floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the new hotel . I can ' t say enough about the staff , wonderful The rooms are elegant but on the small side but the bathroom is to die for . We stayed in the older Conrad loved it too but this is on a different level . Even if u are not staying there try the restaurant and bar on the 20th floor outstanding . We travel a lot and are diamond members so I am not easy to please . Now my new favorite hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just a great experience . Amazing location and service . Robert from the Bell Staff was top notch . They really make you feel at home . The rooms are clean and maintained very well . The internet is 5 times faster than what I am used to when traveling . Very nice ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had our wedding block for our guests and families during co ##vid ##19 at hotel all ##egro . The staff is beyond extraordinary . They went out of there way to help with everything we needed . From allowing dogs to arranging photo shoots for our wedding party . I cannot recommend this place enough ! Fantasy is probably the best most patient person on the planet . She made this step of our wedding stress free . Also , the hotel is just gorgeous ! Take a moment to look at all the detail in this f ##abulous building ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I spent 5 days at the Hilton Chicago and we completely enjoyed our time ! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful , and the accommodation ##s were great ! Our room overlooked Lake Michigan which provided amazing views and scenery . The Hilton boasts several great places to eat and drink , and is in very easy walking distance of plenty restaurants and attractions . High ##ly recommend staying here and we will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay at the Talbot ##t every time we get the chance to travel to Chicago . We love this hotel , D ##wayne always greet ##s us at the door and is a huge help with anything we need . Charles and Perry make sure we have everything we need . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is very pleasant . It is a very clean hotel . Bed ##ding is very nice and comfortable . The bathroom ##s are updated . Very q ##ua ##int hotel . It is close to everything . You can walk a very short distance and find something . [SEP]
1	[CLS] De ##wayne , Perry , S ##ham ##ou ##n , Law ##anna , Jam ##il and Charles are the so great . They make staying here such a pleasure . The service and knowledge of the area but they are all so nice . I ’ ve been staying here twice a year for 12 years and always enjoy returning . They treat us like family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a fantastic hotel right on the Ma ##g Mile . We loved the service , rooms , and location . What really impressed us was the breakfast b ##uff ##et ! We have been blessed to stay in many fine hotels around the world . We love to eat breakfast in these great hotels . The O ##m ##ni ranked in our top few b ##uff ##ets from the other 5 star hotels we have stayed in . The food choices , presentation , and quality were un ##mat ##ched as compared to other nice ##r hotels . If you stay here do not miss this great addition to your experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights in Nov . Even though the name changed to Ki ##nz ##ie , it is still pretty much the same . The rooms are spacious and clean . There is breakfast every morning near the elevator on each floor . There is also a night ##ly happy hour with cocktail ##s and light app ##eti ##zers . The location is perfect . It is in River North near the Ma ##g Mile and Red Line . It is a short walk over the bridge to get to the Loop . Chicago is compact and walk ##able but they also have a top notch public transportation system ( subway and buses ) . Service at the hotel is friendly . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Swiss ##ote ##l itself was amazing . Great Host ##s : at the restaurant , the front desk , the con ##cier ##ge department . Amazing customer service . My room was absolutely amazing . Not to mention that I need to send a f ##ax : great guys - Wesley Keys and John ##ath ##an Roberts at the UP ##S Store in the hotel . I could definitely live in this hotel . And I return for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The executive floors are highly recommended . with the two bathroom option . We were a group of 6 , adult family members , with 3 rooms . As I am a Hilton Honors person , they upgraded two of the rooms to this option , so we could be next to each other . The breakfast was very good as well . ( Great coffee ! ) The friendly bell captains also went out of their way to help us store our luggage until our plane left . . . Everyone there was super nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The kindness and attention to detail is incredible at So ##fit ##el . The floor to ceiling windows on the higher floors have te ##rri ##fic views of downtown Chicago . You feel like your are sleeping in the clouds above the beautiful Wind ##y City sky ##line [SEP]
0	[CLS] After our first visit to O ##m ##ni Chicago , it is easy to decide to return . The rooms were comfortable , as one would expect , but the staff was friendly and professional . The hotel ’ s location made it easy to access all we wanted to see and do . Thanks O ##m ##ni , we shall return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a business trip . The location is fantastic for walking around Chicago . The rooms are very well kept , clean and com ##fy . I loved that the location was close to the river and near the w ##rig ##ley building . It can be a little confusing at first as to where to get an U ##ber ride from , but once you find it in front of the west tower you are good . The lobby and bar area are really cool and have a great energy to them . I ’ ve stayed at many hotels in Chicago over the years and this is probably my favorite based on comfort and location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el is in a great location for walking Michigan Ave , great restaurants and shopping nearby . It ' s close to the north end of the strip , so perfect for walking all the way down the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Our room was clean and bright , with a big bathroom . Service was excellent , v ##alet ##s helpful , check - in was quick . In warmer weather , there ' s a nice area to sit outside and have a drink . We tried excellent restaurants within walking distance . . . Fi ##g & Olive and B ##ist ##ron ##omi ##c . The famous Gibson ##s St ##eak ##house is also within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the brand and have stayed at many Kim ##pton ##s . The service here is excellent as expected . The lobby is beautiful and the drink hour is great . The building is old ( historic ) and its age is showing . The elevators are slow and there was a wait a few times . The room and bathroom were not as high - end as I expected , a lot of fresh black paint over a lot of layers of older paint felt like they were unsuccessfully trying to hide the age . . . The rooms were nice and quiet though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l has great location for everything we wanted to do . Vale ##t parking was expensive . Bed ##s were comfortable . Room ##s were spacious and clean . In room toilet ##ries had a very nice scent to them . Staff was friendly . [SEP]

We were very happy with our choice to stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie and we highly recommend it to everyone ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We unexpectedly received access to the Gold Room and were w ##owed by the guest service provided by Ty ##pha ##ni and her co - workers . Always greeted with a smile and an offer to get us whatever our hearts desired , it was truly royal treatment . I look forward to coming back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The beds and carpet ##s are so old and nasty . We wanted to have a get away in the City but honestly it was not worth the money . The hotel is very average , would rather pay more for a better service and clean ##liness . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s the type of massive hotel , that you go during conventions or conferences . It ' s so massive that has to towers and it ' s rather difficult to get around , it took me 2 days to figure it out . Try to go for a room that has access to the Club Level , where breakfast served is very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great clean hotel . It had everything we needed and more . Full kitchen not a kitchen ##ette . Staff for super friendly and helpful . The only con would be the indoor pool is a little small and parking was a little price ##y but overall this is a great Hotel . We would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So it ' s been a while since my visit and am just now getting around to reviewing , as I just came across my room photos on my phone . Any ##ho ##oo , it ' s a really lovely hotel . Nice ##ly decorated . Very comfortable room . Nice lounge / cocktail hour upstairs . Had an off the street room so no noise issues , but not much in the way of a view . It really was just a great hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] High ##ly recommend this newly re ##mo ##del ##ed hotel . Location was perfect . The customer service was exceptional . Lex ##y was able to find and make Easter br ##unch reservations at the last minute . T ##HA ##N ##K YOU L ##EX ##Y ! ! ! The location allowed us to walk to most of our destinations but when we needed a cab , there was always one waiting ( which was faster than u ##ber ) . P ##lent ##y of outlets close to the bed for charging all of our devices . The curtains would open or close with a touch of a button . I ' d definitely stay again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 4 nights for International House ##ware ##s . Location is great to get to M ##c ##C ##orm ##mic ##k with the bus right outside . The con ##cier ##ge club was being red ##one so they had a te ##mp one on the 8th floor . I had a great corner room with a view down the river . Room was large beds good and the street noise was not too bad at all . Overall I would stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is very run down ! From the moment I walked into the hotel I could see it . The carpet ##s are very old and the elevator cab ##s were all beat and scratched up . The carpet in the hallway to my room was past its life ##sa ##pan and was faded and din ##gy . My room was more of the same . The walls were s ##cu ##ffed and scratched up and the carpet looked old . The bathroom smelled . You could not open the cabinet doors all the way that held the coffee maker and refrigerator due to the bed being in the way . The hardware was falling off so the doors would not close properly and the knob ##s didn ’ t look like they had been cleaned for a while . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just stayed here . Everything e ##as fine . Location is awesome . Show ##er is amazing too ! I loved The bathroom ! $ 20 us ##d breakfast credit for Ex ##ped ##ia VIP ##was a very nice surprise too ! I would totally recommend if you want great location and service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hu ##ge shout out to She ##rato ##n Grand . This is my favorite hotel to stay at while visiting Chicago . A couple blocks from Navy Pier and the Bean . Numerous amazing restaurants in the area . I had a minor issue that Eric Ball ##en , Front Des ##k Manager , provided E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##T customer service ! My only complaint is they really should provide free W ##if ##i . This is the only hotel I will stay at when visiting Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , a great place to stay ! The staff was really friendly and fast to meet needs such as extra towels , etc . It is located in a great part of the city . We walked to many stores and shops to enjoy the Chicago experience . We stayed here for a wedding . Most of the wedding party / family was there too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Palmer House was convenient for seeing Hamilton at the C ##IB ##C Theater . For an old downtown Chicago hotel , the room was spacious and modern . Service was excellent . Bed was great for sleeping . High ##ly recommend V ##iver ##e for the good food and overall restaurant experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location in Chicago in a hotel that has a lot of history and plenty of am ##bian ##ce . Typically reasonably priced I always stay at this hotel in Chicago . It is close to everything downtown and has a great gym . Room ##s are sometimes small , but the history of the building makes up for it . High ##ly recommend it as a place to stay in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Is a relaxing hotel in the city and within walking distance to many activities and restaurants . The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are clean . The bar on the upper floor over ##look ##s the city and is a nice spot for a drink and conversation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great stay here and really enjoyed interacting with the hotel staff . The rooms were very clean and the bathroom ##s were gorgeous .

0	[CLS] Everyone that works here is so nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We had a wonderful welcome , they got us right into our V ##ER ##Y clean room . The compliment ##ary app ##eti ##zers between 5 and 8 was a perfect start to our evening . The compliment ##ary breakfast was great and convenient . I would strongly recommend staying here if you want a nice and relaxing stay with happy people a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting all of your needs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is in a great spot and close to the river . Room wasn ’ t ready when I arrived early and check in is 3 ##pm . The room is very spacious with mice amenities . Some of my colleagues has cap ##pu ##cci ##no makers in their room and I did not . I asked via a note to maid to have more regular coffee and didn ’ t get when I arrived back in the room . One night I stopped at the bar for a glass of wine which totaled $ 35 - w ##ow ! Sorry , but that is ridiculous . I ’ ve never paid that in NYC . Overall the hotel is nice but the little things matter to me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for work for a week . It is close to the downtown area and close to fun things to do once the work day was done . There is not a restaurant on site but they do have a great lounge area . Every night for a few hours good ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres and a bar with house drinks or the bartender to make what you want . I will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We checked into this hotel on Monday , before the holiday . We had plans to visit local roof top bars and Navy Pier . Our room was clean and quiet with excellent views of Lake Michigan and the river . We could walk to everything we wanted to do and see ! No taxi needed . All the staff we encountered , from the door ##man to the con ##cier ##ge , etc . were helpful and eager to please . We had breakfast and lunch at the hotel ( as well as several glasses of wine ) and all were delicious . We will be back ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay at the hotel . It started with a surprising compliment ##ary upgrade of my room due to my birthday . When I arrived to the hotel with my birthday balloon and flowers the room upgrade offer turned into yet another birthday surprise . Modern , comfortable room with perfect bathroom . Extra friendly staff . Happy hour free drinks also add to the great impression of the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This luxurious hotel is in a great location with great views . Staff are friendly and efficient and the rooms are extremely comfortable and spacious . There are a variety of eating and shopping options ( that are easily walk ##able ) close by , as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome time in Chicago . Alicia at the front Honors desk is exceptional . In Kitty O ' Shea ' s , Margaret , and all the other girls were great as always . Bus ##y with bears fans and convention go ##ers . If you are a professional drink ##er you time it for the drinks and ma ##xi ##mize the experience . Don ' t wait for the glass to be empty . Ryan Castillo Food manager was a pleasure to talk with . We had a great time as always . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , great amenities , and close to everything ! I loved the check in process and the staff was very helpful on getting me to my restaurant . One of the staff members must of saw the lost look in my eyes and immediately sprang to our assistance . 10 / 10 Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel knocks me out with their service and value . You receive texts on how to make your stay better . Wonderful ##ly centralized location , and a beautiful pool . Well worth the rate . You will feel as though you are at the R ##itz . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location . The check - in / con ##cier ##ge are at the same place . As in - room telephone does not work , the request for service is super challenging . The towels or bath robe are not ad ##e ##q ##ute ( varies from day to day what will be missing ) . Compared to other location , this one has more room for improvement . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to stay at the Conrad in April due to the location , the pictures and the fact that it was new . It seemed like a great option for my wife and i . It turned out to be a G ##RE ##AT choice . The rooms are incredibly nice and well furnished . There is TO ##NS of space and the bathroom ##s are very spacious as well . The staff was very helpful and I loved the fact that the lobby was at the top instead of the bottom . You don ##t have to pass through a " busy " place to get to your room when you ' re tired and ready to go in . The restaurants and bars were both great . I highly recommend the Conrad to anyone looking for a place in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visit the H ##ya ##tt annually for a conference and it is always a great stay . Staff is very professional , room is very , very clean and food service is top notch . I always look forward to my next return trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie is quite modern ##ly furnished . Location is super good . Bed ##s were great . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast on each floor in front of elevators . Good idea but they have a hard time to re ##fill everything . Had to find my coffee in another floor . Silent rooms . I ’ d look at this hotel again if I was to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good v ##ibes in the Monaco from the moment we walked in the front door . Front desk staff was lovely and welcoming . Our room on the 14th floor was beautifully decorated , with a great river view . Quite and comfortable . Wonderful location is an easy walk to restaurants and more . We thoroughly enjoyed our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were clean but dated . Hall ##ways of hotel were littered with plates of food and trash for extended periods of time . Full day in some cases . Room ##s were clean but dated . Had an issue at check in with getting a king size bed we pre - requested . They were out of rooms at our price point so tried to up ##cha ##rge to get us what we requested in the first place . Great location but disappointed in general . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed one night at this hotel while in town for a doctor visit . Check in was very easy . You simply pull up in front of the hotel and the v ##alet will take your car from there . There was no wait at check ##in . We were placed on the 23rd floor . The room was a bit small , but probably standard for the Chicago area . The hotel was very busy , but we did not hear a single p ##eep of anything once we were in our room . The room was clean and comfortable . The pool is really neat ( it ' s very old - school ) , but it was busy so we did not go swimming . You can ' t really beat the location of the hotel . Overall , I ' d highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the rooms were very clean with a nice offering of amenities . Unfortunately the pool and the gym were under construction , so I was unable to experience them . Although , in the interim the Swiss ##ote ##l had worked out a deal with a local gym to allow their guests to work out at their facility . Although I did not have time to go to the facility down the street , the gesture was appreciated . I would book a stay in the future with Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This property is located near the river and you can easily walk along the river shops and restaurants or go down a few blocks to the main shopping area . My room was very clean and updated with a very comfortable bed and great pillows ! I was on the top floor with a great view of the river and sky ##line . Great place to sleep after long days at the convention center ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] While in Chicago we visited both the W ##aldo ##rf As ##toria and the So ##fit ##el . So ##fit ##el ' s atmosphere , luxury and know ##led ##gable staff beat the W ##aldo ##rf hands down . The restaurant was superior , even the check in was remarkable . . . try it , you ' ll see what I mean . These people K ##N ##OW what they ' re doing and do it right . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##ab location , right in the centre of the city . The rooms are nicely furnished with everything you need and nice and clean ! Bar serves amazing chocolate ma ##rt ##ini ##s - must try ! ! Staff are friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel several times on business . Really lovely modern hotel located close to millennium park in the loop . Room service and meals are also great if expensive . One of my top choices for Chicago stays . [SEP]
0	[CLS] When hosting a sponsored event , take into consideration your demographic . Off ##ering some economical food and beverage options would fall in line with the many families that stayed at this hotel . There are many other properties in Chicago that are much more fiscal ##ly responsible when serving families . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is very big and left us slightly confused on where to go to check - in ( oddly enough , reception is a floor above ) . Love ##ly bar area and lovely de ##cor . Sad ##ly we did not use the pool facilities in the hotel . Room is slightly out ##dated for my personal taste but still a comfortable , nice stay . Just like every other Hilton though , they over ##cha ##rge you for everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has old world charm which I find lovely . The location can ' t be beat , near Oak Street Beach , Water Tower , The Museum of Contemporary Art . The staff is polite and professional . I asked for a room in a " quiet zone , " no loud noise from stairs , elevators , ice machines , or ram ##bu ##nc ##ti ##ous guests . The room we were given for 2 people was a little small , very clean , the view was d ##rea ##ry , overlooking the rear of the hotel . However , our industrial corner was very quiet and we got a good night ' s sleep . Since we weren ' t in our room that much , we were fine with the lack of view and limited room space . The hotel did give us the quiet we asked for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was a gorgeous king corner suite overlooking Michigan Avenue . Absolutely f ##abulous ! The staff was exceptional as well . The hotel is close to Millennium Park which is definitely worth the walk . Walking along the lake was a welcome relief for travel and work stress . I can ' t wait to return next year ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve had really good luck with this hotel and have been back a few times when visiting downtown Chicago . This hotel is nice for couples or families . We love the extra room , clean accommodation ##s , nice pool , and hot breakfast . The room is spacious with a separate living room and kitchen ##ette . Bed ##s are com ##fy . Bath ##rooms are clean . The pool area is nice with a gorgeous view of downtown . We definitely recommend a stay here if you want to be close to everything downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fe ##licity Gardner was great when checking out . Michelle from accounts email ##ed me within 5 days and everything went smoothly . Great location and food ! ! A little hard to find as GPS took us to lower W ##ack ##er . Great hotel , close to everything , as it is on the river walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 5 stars to this hotel . . room was great . . location was accessible to everything and price wise it was economical . . . really likes this place . . breakfast was great and nice retreat to eyes . . this is closest to many attractions with hardly 15 to 20 min ##s distance . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Hotel Monaco on NY ##E . Hotel is a typical Kim ##pton de ##cor , with friendly staff , good sized rooms and comfortable beds and pillows . Front door service and v ##alet were very at ##ten ##tive , and while price ##y is par for the course in Chicago . A great location in the middle of the city . Would definitely stay at this hotel again . Make sure that you go to the restaurant that is connected to the hotel - South Water Kitchen - and ask for Dan to make you a drink . He , and his drinks , are amazing . We ordered some apps and had a few drinks which were great - would be interested in having dinner there during our next trip . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Man ##dan ##a at the Gold Lounge provided great service for the three days we were there . She was friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and after barely a day there she had our orders me ##mor ##ized ! So helpful . She was very pleasant and court ##eous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] . . which is essential for [UNK] Apart from that large rooms and very good staff . It is situated in a great location so you will be close to just about every place you want to visit in town and coffee was available downstairs ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A wonderful facility right on Michigan Ave in downtown Chicago . The v ##alet staff are absolutely wonderful ( the cost , however is ridiculous . ) Check - in was effort ##less , and the room was just as depicted . Don ##t miss the b ##al ##con ##ies off of the pool / fitness area ! ! ! Close to all the action ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] High - end hotel with nice - sized rooms , comfortable beds , and all of the amenities needed and / or wanted in a luxury hotel . The Spa was awesome - excellent technicians and massage therapist ##s and in imp ##ec ##ca ##ble shape / very clean . Staff overall was at ##ten ##tive and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . Con ##cier ##ge gave us great restaurant suggestions and were eager to please . Bar in the Lo ##bby was small and there aren ' t a lot of places to sit and meet friends for a drink - a bit limiting in this respect . Overall , a wonderful experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] People were lovely , the lobby was glorious , but plaster was p ##eel ##ing off the ceiling of the bath / shower . Also , the toilet paper di ##spense ##r was behind my left shoulder , which would be ok if I could pinch off a few squares with my shoulder blades . Also — personal p ##ee ##ve — having already over three hundred for the room , it seems like another $ 18 for W ##i ##F ##i is a bit go ##uge ##y , although I get the charge is partly to drive people into the H ##H ##ono ##rs program . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and even better service . My negative ##s are so minus ##cule that they are not worth noting . Nice feel overall , the Le Bar has great cocktail ##s ! Room service was great . I ’ m giving 4 stars because they do not have a full service spa on premises but they do provide spa services in the comfort of your room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was clean and well stock ##ed , hallway ##s are well lit , and the elevators were quick . The restaurant and bar area was co ##zy and there are plenty of lounge areas in the lobby . Third visit and all trips have been consistently great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We will definitely be back ! What a charming city Chicago is and what a base from which to take in all the city has to offer . I have never felt so safe or so welcome . I highly recommend the maple bra ##ids at breakfast and the dry cleaning service . Also the hotel is walking distance from Pi ##zz ##eria Un ##o where we experienced the highlight of our trip : Chicago Deep Di ##sh ! We came for business but we will be returning for pleasure and we will definitely be staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a reservation for 2 nights for a quick trip to Chicago . Unfortunately , our airline had trouble and ended up cancel ##ing our trip . The hotel would not re ##im ##bur ##se our hotel reservation for that night . At least offer a v ##ou ##cher . NO . Will not book at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Home ##wood in September for a family get away and loved it ! The hotel is within walking distance of several restaurants and shopping . Navy Pier is within a close walk and if you are up for it we even walked back from Solid ##er Field . The spacious rooms have all been recently renovated and looked brand new . We thought we would use the kitchen area but there were so many places to eat nearby we never did . Breakfast was good and we liked that the selections changed day to day so we were not stuck with the same options everyday like most compliment ##ary hotel breakfast ##s . My kids loved the pool on the top floor , they had never seen a pool like that before . The staff were all very welcoming and friendly . We just wish we could have stayed longer ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quick weekend get ##away , Love the location . Room was very nice and staff were super at ##ten ##tive . Michael Jordan Bar on premise was great , . From front desk to bell hop everyone was happy and friendly . It was so nice to travel again ! Classic old school hotel ! We will be back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Inc ##red ##ible customer service ! I wanted to extend a huge note of appreciation to Julius Dr ##ox ##y , the front desk attendant who checked us in . He was so friendly and at ##ten ##tive and went above and beyond to make our experience memorable . Through our conversation he noted it was my mothers birthday and had some good ##ies sent up to our room . To my mom ##s absolute surprise , she was so delighted to see the birthday card and hand written note ! It ’ s the little things and this experience made our trip ! ! Thank you , Julius ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room we had 1814 was outstanding - one of the best we ' ve ever stayed in in Chicago . Super ##b bathroom , plenty of towels , big flat screen , super com ##fy bed and very ups ##cale furniture . Check in and check out was very efficient and helpful . Breakfast was a little b ##land but still adequate - cheaper options available offs ##ite . This was our first stay at Conrad Chicago , but we ' ll definitely stay there again . Very convenient to Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoy the staff . The location is perfect close to almost everything . So nice to have a separate area to cook and eat . If you want to eat out , going down to the food there in the hotel is g ##rea . Breakfast and dinner during the week is perfect . . After a fun play day what could be better ? Pretty easy . . Try it you ' ll like it [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is well known . Its lobby ceiling is a thing to ma ##rve ##l at . If you stay there , or just wanna visit this hotel ' s lobby to see how grand this hotel really is , visit the bar in the lobby , look up , the ceiling is definitely the centre ##piece of this hotel Perhaps grand ##ios ##e of yes ##tery ##ear ##s , this hotel is showing its age . The room is huge by today ' s standard , spacious , but the lighting is dim . The wash ##room facilities are clean , but it is nothing but standard high - end motel - style f ##au ##ce ##ts and accessories . It offers a comfortable bed , but again , does it deserve the Hilton name as I have found that a regular Hilton has newer and better facilities than this old lady . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Exactly as mentioned in the title of this review . The aesthetics are an experience in and of itself . Once , you walk into the room you are blown away by the beauty of the minimal ##ist design and approach . This actually makes you relax a bit more during your stay as it helps you adapt to a slower , calm ##er pace of day . The morning room service is G ##RE ##AT ! You have to treat yourself to breakfast here . The staff were always helpful , from front desk to bartender ##s to house ##keeping . This is where we ' ll always stay when we visit Chicago . Gold Coast is a beautiful neighborhood as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A $ 20 . 00 amenities fee is automatically charged to your card , regardless if you want it or not . This is not explained at check - in and not easily identified on the website . As the customer , this is a de ##ceptive and secret ##ive policy . The hotel refused to re ##fu ##nd the charge . Additionally , I was di ##sp ##lea ##sed with the customer service . Upon check - out , the front desk attendant was furiously wiping down her work area and was too busy to properly check me out . While she assured me she would email me a re ##ceipt , she never did . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were clean , wonderful service . I will be back for sure . The hotel staff was friendly and tentative to our event , Was there for a conference with over 600 people and it was well maintained and clean . Great recommendation [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the So ##fit ##el during a five day break to Chicago this winter . The hotel is beautiful and rooms are as to be expected from So ##fit ##el . We enjoyed our stay and particularly R ##omi in the restaurant . Excellent professional server . . . thanks R ##omi ! ! Check in was poor , I don ' t think the agent really paid much attention . A ##rri ##val was poor we had to s ##ch ##le ##p our bags through the front door . . . no help at all , we saw a lack of staff helping there almost everyday . None the less the stay was great and hotel as mentioned great . We would stay here again if we travel back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location in downtown Chicago near shops , food , theatre , and great experiences . During the summer run up the lake or check out the Lincoln park zoo and in the winter you can stay warm at the 900 mall or grab juice at Joe and the Ju ##ice next door . Love ##ly staff ( despite recent ownership change ) . D ##WA ##Y ##NE is amazing - always remembers our family and goes above and beyond to ensure we have a smooth check in / check out and easy v ##alet experience . Also , since we love to work ##out , I appreciate that they have both a small gym in house ( with a p ##elo ##ton ! ) as well as ability to use the local E ##quin ##ox for $ 25 a day . Have stayed dozens of times and will continue to come back whenever we need a home away from home ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you are looking for a place to stay on Michigan Ave downtown Chicago this is a great place to stay . The staff is wonderful . Its a hotel that will make you feel like family . We enjoy coming back every year during the holiday season . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly weekend get away with the husband . Stay ##ed at the Monaco in a room on the 8th floor with a phenomena ##l view of the city and Trump Tower . Divine window seat in the room to boot . A great bet for Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent overall services . Restaurant ##s , reception , house ##keeping quick customer responses Good food . Excellent location ease of transportation to and from the hotel . Please keep all the good and court ##eous services up [SEP]
0	[CLS] If the weather is such that you will spend a lot of time indoor ##s , upgrade to the Regency Club . You will find every thing you need from a heart ##y breakfast to start your day , to all newspapers you need to good quality coffee . Then at the end of a tough day , get a cold beer and snack ##s and enjoy the evening news or a basketball game on TV . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is beautiful , rooms are very spacious and the staff was excellent , will definitely return ! ! Nice bar area , we didn ' t have br ##unch , but the restaurant was full of people having br ##unch and there was a bloody ma ##ry bar that looked amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is extremely dated and needs a make ##over , some rooms smelled of s ##tale smoke . The bar is stunning as is the history but not worth staying there . Had to change rooms because of the smoke smell and new room had zero water pressure in guest bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very co ##zy and well maintained hotel in a great location . I have stayed at several hotels in the vicinity in the past few years , this is our second stay this year and we will return . Recently renovated and it shows . The staff is very friendly , court ##eous and helpful . A very good value in this location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had an absolutely amazing stay . The staff , the food , the room , everything was exceptional ! I highly recommend anyone visiting Chicago to book their room at the So ##fit ##el . To top it off they allowed me to bring my dog inside which made the visit even more memorable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and hotel . Stay ##ed for 3 nights and couldn ’ t ask for a better location . Within walking distance to everything , a block or 2 to Macy ’ s , target , c ##v ##s , museums , the river , restaurants ! ! ! Room ##s are small but really clean and well equipped . Star ##bu ##cks on site . The bar has the most amazing ceiling , literally a work of art ! ! Give the flat top g ##rill a go , less than 2 minutes walk delicious food and great value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was clean and quiet . The rooms are darker given the older , but beautiful architecture of the building . The building itself has a classic 1920s feel ( with modern convenience ##s ) , which I like . I am giving four stars instead five because some layers of the bath ##tub in the bathroom were p ##eel ##ing . Breakfast b ##uff ##et was very good . The pool is beautiful , but busy on the Saturday evening we decided to swim . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a pleasant stay . The hotel is very clean , the staff court ##eous and the hotel is central ##ly located . Too bad we missed the compliment ##ary wine at the designated hours . But we had compliment ##ary coffee and it was excellent . Oh , we also love the window seat . We will definitely book at this hotel the next time we ' re in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Really enjoyed my stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago downtown , The staff went out of their way to make me feel well and comfortable . The bar staff was exceptional as well , with great cocktail selections . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is located in a residential ups ##cale neighborhood , near plenty of great restaurants , and only a half a mile from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It had a parking garage with a private door and v ##alet parking for $ 35 ( cheap by Chicago standard ) . They recently reopened after 10 months of CO ##VI ##D shut ##down . the hotel restaurant / bar are not open yet but there are places that will deliver if that is what you need . We were a group of eight and everyone praised the hotel selection . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went for the weekend and stayed for four days . Overall I ' m so happy I chose this hotel , the interior is themed like Monaco , very clean and co ##zy . The location is right in the middle of everything , right in the downtown of Chicago . The staff ##s was so nice and helpful , we enjoyed our stay very much . I highly recommended to stay at the Kim ##pton Monaco Chicago . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will come back to stay when I visit Chicago again : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at hotel on our wedding night 50 years ago . Staff surprised us with a bottle of Champagne and chocolate covered straw ##berries . So happy to see that H ##ya ##tt has restored the hotel to original grand ##eur . Staff absolutely professional and welcoming . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a good stay . Very friendly staff . And a really beautiful lobby . Room was nice . But not the clean ##est . Was just for a quick stay . Got a very good deal and so I suspect did others . Women throwing up in hallway at 2 am is not the hotel ' s fault . And the steam clean the next am is what I would expect . But I got what I paid for . Might try again because I love older hotels . Not a deal break ##er but have enjoyed other stays better . Worth a stay . Great location as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent location , but you ' ll pay for it . The a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s were nice , although they do not have a swimming pool for use . Very close to the Bean , and nice eat ##eries . Con ##cier ##ge was great . We got discount for our dinner reservations which helped . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose this hotel to spend our 40 th Anniversary . First ##ly it is difficult to find . . . GPS will take you to Lower W ##ack ##er Dr . And you need to be on Upper W ##ack ##er . So , ask for directions in advance . There was quite a long line at check in . . . probably a 20 minute wait . We had reserved a Corner Life ##style Suite , which we were told was not available . My husband spoke with management and we were finally given the correct room type . The views on Navy Pier and the Chicago River were amazing . Room ##s are very clean but almost s ##ter ##ile in de ##cor . We were not expecting the minimal ##ist feel , but enjoyed the 2 bathroom ##s and the space . Location is good too . Thanks to the staff for the compliment ##ary champagne and straw ##berries : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent service , location , food . hi quality hotel for great price . Easy access to Miracle Mile . Great view from restaurant . Excellent br ##unch ; Staff very at ##ten ##tive . Don ' t let 20th floor lobby con ##fuse , [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel in an excellent location . You can walk everywhere . Staff is beyond nice . Room was beautiful and comfortable . Re ##com ##men ##d it highly . I was given an upgrade , as per my H ##hon ##ors level , before I even asked . Really liked the compliment ##ary water and soda in the room . Great amenities in the bathroom . Very comfortable beds and a H ##U ##GE television . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are only using the hotel to sleep , rest and then go for business or to the McCormick Exhibition centre , this is a good one to stay at . It ' s clean , w ##if ##i in room works well . Really close to centre of town . Easy 15 - 20 ##min walk to Millennium Park to get the train to McCormick centre . Con ##fi ##rm it is dark due to the d ##é ##cor , I had all lights all to see the laptop . Restaurant for breakfast was good . Good at ##ten ##tive staff . I was able to get breakfast within 10 ##mins of ordering . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You are steps from Michigan A ##v and a few blocks north of the river at this central ##ly - located hotel Park ##ing is v ##alet , but more reasonable than many garage ##s . A full breakfast and weekday evening cocktail hour is included . Each room has a separate living area with a fully - functional kitchen . Even if you do not plan to cook , it is pleasant to have the room to spread out when you have coffee or a drink in your room . The views from the higher floors are great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first Kim ##pton hotel and it was great ! We really enjoyed our stay and our room . Kim ##pton hotels are all amazing and you can ' t really go wrong with any of them . They are all fun , clean , decorated well , and a free evening wine hour . This hotel is in the heart of the theatre district , so it ' s a perfect option for a night out at the theater . Even the staircase to the lobby makes you feel like you are in the lobby of a theater ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] the front desk person was very polite and court ##eous . The room was a let down . Very small bed was uncomfortable , a king bed but only 2 tiny flat pillows , the room smelled like someone had been smoking bad weed , a star ##bu ##cks cup was in the refrigerator , the room was not well appointed at all , very tire small and smelled awful . Would not recommend and would not stay again even if paid to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have been there for 2 weeks , pretty well located in the Loop and close to my office . Room ##s are smart and well furnished . . . cleaning is ok . . . bathroom perfect ! Just a minor : no breakfast . . . just tea and coffee freely provided . . . but Star ##bu ##cks is almost in the hotel : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here at the beginning and end of a 4 , 000 mile road trip around the Midwest and Northwest in May 2014 . It ' s a lovely hotel , well located within walking distance of Millennium Park and the awesome AI ##C . Staff were pleasant and helpful , the rooms were clean and well appointed . On the second visit I booked a river ##front room , which had a great window - s ##nu ##g overlooking the river . De ##fin ##ite ##ly worth the additional cost . I ' d be tempted to use the same hotel when I return to Chicago , which isn ' t something I usually do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here 3 nights in October on the executive level which means that you get a free breakfast and w ##if ##i and a few ni ##bble ##s , past ##a , soft drinks in the evening but the alcoholic drinks are quite expensive . The room was huge with 2 bathroom ##s but it was probably in need of a make ##over but it didn ’ t s ##po ##il our stay and the beds were very comfortable . The foyer is a sight to see especially the ceiling which has 21 different paintings on it , The hotel is in a great position for everything and everyone was very friendly and we would stay again . Chicago is a great walk ##able city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! This hotel is within walking distance of many downtown attractions . Except ##ional service . Clean and modern rooms . Del ##icious compliment ##ary breakfast with various food options . I would absolutely stay here again in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] As a first time visiting Chicago and the O ##m ##ni Hotel itself , I had a very fast check In . The hotel was clean and the staff is friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I loved the fact I got a sleep kit which is great . The room was clean and had a great amount of space for myself and significant other . I will like to see USB wall charge ##rs for convenience , other wise it was a great stay at my hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was amazing with great views , plenty of room , H ##U ##GE window seats just gorgeous ! When my husband booked the room he mentioned it was my birthday and we were in town to see a Bears game . When we arrived they had balloons in the bedroom ( Bears colors of course ) and Po ##m p ##oms and a B ##EA ##RS FA ##N ON ##L ##Y parking sign . They had a birthday card signed for me by some staff and Bears colored j ##elly bell ##ies , my husband had no idea they would do that . It was out of the ordinary amazing welcome and I will never stay anywhere else , also we have decided if we travel we will always check Kim ##pton hotels first ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at The Talbot ##t last March and we were impressed enough that we stayed there again this past weekend . We thoroughly enjoyed our stay because of : 1 ) the incredible friend ##liness and helpful ##ness of all employees at the hotel ; 2 ) the clean ##liness of our room and its comfort ; and , 3 ) the very reasonable rate , especially for a fantastic location in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] P ##U ##BL ##IC is one of the nice ##st hotels I ' ve been in . Custom ##er service was fantastic . Upon check in , we were upgraded to a larger room when we told them it was my husband ' s 30th birthday . On check out , we were able to leave our luggage in the hotel since we had a later flight . There was a bit of a mix up with someone charging food to the room but they removed the charge as soon as we disputed it . House ##keeping was good . Only thing is the walls seem a bit thin , and the p ##lum ##bing is ridiculous ##ly loud . I mean , the water pressure is strong which is awesome but we thought it was funny how loud it got when one flushed . Would absolutely recommend staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would recommend everyone to stay at the hotel Public ! The hotel is central ##ly located , the staff is amazing , and I love the modern de ##cor . This was my first trip to Chicago and I thank the con ##cier ##ge Travis H for being so helpful with his recommendations and great service ! I cannot wait to go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel accommodation ##s were as expected . The staff was helpful & friendly ( even the ladies that serviced the rooms ) . The staff accommodate ##d us when we had everyone trying to use the elevators . My view was amazing from my room [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed at many nice hotels in Chicago , but put the Intercontinental at the top of the list . The location on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile is perfect , close to many excellent restaurants , shopping and the major sites . Staff is friendly and helpful . Room ##s are very clean . The pool is very nice . Fitness center could use some help . The bed in the room was one of the most comfortable I ’ ve ever slept in . Overall a great stay . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location on Michigan Avenue , close to plenty of museums , restaurants , and shopping . If you pay extra for a lake view and choose a high floor , daily sunrise ##s and seasonal fireworks at Navy Pier are easily visible . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were well sized and the location was great . We were right across the street from an event we were attending so it couldn ' t be beaten . The lobby is stunning , but the rooms are definitely in need of a re ##vi ##tal ##ization . The bathroom ##s are small , and the shower ##s are like shower ##s you ' d find in a starter apartment . The blow dry ##ers also were sub ##par . That ' s something small but was expecting a nice ##r one for the price of the room . Otherwise , the beds were comfortable and the rooms temperature was well regulated with in room the ##rm ##ost ##ats , which I am a fan of . Would stay again for the location alone , but if the weather is expected to be nice , I ' d probably go a couple blocks away somewhere else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked th ##ru E ##gen ##cia and received a separate " resort fee " of $ 25 / night from the hotel . While it was in the fine print of additional fees in the E ##gen ##cia it ##ener ##ary , it is truly an addition to the room rate displayed on the site when I booked a room . This seems a s ##hady business practice for such a class ##y and nice hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had only one night available in Chicago and the location of this hotel was prime . The service was excellent . The room felt and look high end . I was able to cover all downtown in that one day . If I were to book again , I will choose this exact hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here twice , in 2016 and 2019 . Very pretty hotel full of history . Value for money . It ' s further than expected from the ' central ' area though , I mi ##s ##ju ##dged the scale on the map , and it was a 45 min ##s walk to where I had to be for the week at A ##on Center . But it was a nice walk , wouldn ' t do it in winter . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##y , clean and comfortable room . Excellent breakfast . En ##joy ##ed the compliment ##ary drinks and snack ##s in the evening too . We were thrilled to check - in early . Nice area , close to transportation and Eat ##aly ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was not cleaned by house ##keeping on a recent stay . The front desk told me at check out that they would deposit 20 , 000 points in my Hilton Honors program as an apology . . . . . which hey have never done . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago was awesome . The Room was beautiful , toilet was clean and spacious . I had a wonderful view outside from my window . The staff at the hotel were all very polite and friendly . I would love to stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved this hotel and we will definitely be returning . The staff was superb , the hotel clean and comfortable , and the location was perfect ! And they have a very nice wine hour in the late afternoon for all guests to meet and enjoy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got a great deal on this hotel on Ex ##ped ##ia and really enjoyed my stay there . Staff is very friendly , Lots of guests would hang out in the lobby just to enjoy the atmosphere and free coffee and cocktail hours . Free newspapers including NY ##T and USA today [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , staff and spacious rooms . Every staff member was nice ##r than the next from house ##keeping to the front desk and everywhere in between . Service was excellent . I think this location is perfect . . . so many things to do and places to eat within walking distance . I just loved the open lobby and many sitting areas to encourage guests to meet . I also like having a host at the door available to answer questions , give direction etc . Well done H ##ya ##tt ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed here to celebrate like tourists in our own city . We loved our room , the bed , amenities and bathroom , plus the super - friendly front desk staff . Good location for walking . Steps away from Michigan Avenue . It was winter , so we did not get a chance to visit the roof . We will come back during the warmer months to do that ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Palmer house in Chicago for the first time . Cho ##se it because the off - season rate was ridiculous ##ly low . Because of the rate , did not expect too much . Turn ##ed out to be incredibly nice facility . Room was nice , all of the service is been wonderful , the breakfast was very good . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will stay here again next time . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago for 3 nights on our first stop on our USA Holiday and it was the best hotel we stayed at our entire holiday . The check in process was smooth , the staff were all so lovely and helpful and they offered to upgrade us for a small price which we happily accepted as we knew we were going to be jet la ##gged . We ordered room service on the first night and it was delicious . We already want to come back and yes we will be staying here again ! ! Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a situation we we had river cruise tickets but no where to put our luggage . H ##ya ##tt extended our check out time by two hours to help us in our time of need and we didn ' t even have to ask . Des ##k manager heard us discussing our problem and simply offered to help . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a a G ##RE ##AT location . Very central ##ly located . The rooms are com ##fy and of good size . Matt ##ress was a bit hard for our liking , but might be good for others . There were a few parties we could hear but considering the room stayed pretty quite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Location ! No car needed for us . We used the v ##alet Park ##ing and left it sparked for our 2 Days of touring Great Service . Q ##ua ##int and Historic feel . Craig was a Friendly and We ##l ##coming Help ! Room was clean and Bed ##s were comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a wonderful location - Eat ##aly is literally around the corner , and it was a great base for us during a conference at the Mar ##riot ##t on the next block . The staff were friendly , and the hotel is up - to - date and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the Fair ##mont for work . Te ##rri ##fic location - easy to get anywhere in Chicago . De ##fin ##ite ##ly worth getting the Con ##cier ##ge level treatment . Easy coffee etc in the AM and wine and sweet ##s in the PM . Mu ##gu and the other con ##cier ##ge staff were extremely helpful in helping to book a few fun things too . The rooms are a bit dated and could use an upgrade but overall very clean and great spot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was wonderful , great location , easy to walk to everything , yet not noisy . The room was amazing , spacious , comfortable bed , beautifully decorated and , best of all , the most incredible views ! Very friendly staff and want to especially thank Di ##met ##re who went out of his way to help us and make us feel welcome and appreciated . Only wish we had been able to stay several more days but look forward to returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I think the rooms can be s ##pruce ##d up a bit . The rooms don ’ t match the name . Otherwise everything is top notch . Great guest services , they welcome and accommodate wonderful ##ly . Prime location , close to E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING . We were there for our anniversary and they took care of us with compliment ##ary wine and a beautiful card . A very pleasant surprise . We would love to stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing hotel ! Such a ch ##ic design and wonderful amenities . The rooms are lovely and spacious . The lobby , bar , and restaurants are all f ##abulous . I really can ' t wait to be back . Also — the hotel ' s rich history is super cool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel room was large and comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful , including contact ##ing us as soon as they found we had left our passports in the room safe ! Happy hour with compliment ##ary bubbles was an added feature in the spacious lobby area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Sur ##prise ##d to see the negative reviews of this property , as I was generally happy with it . I had good quality furniture that did not " sink " ( though how much furniture " sinks " can sometimes also be because of the person seated on it ) , I really enjoyed the am ##bian ##ce lighting , and think this would make a great couples hotel for anyone looking for a romantic weekend . The view of the city was fantastic , the location was spectacular , and the room was on point . Would absolutely stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at this hotel while visiting Chicago . It is a very nice hotel though the rooms are a bit small . Still , it was a great visit . The hotel was very clean and the employees were extremely at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chicago offers a number of bout ##ique hotels and many mainstream hotels . So ##fit ##el Water Tower is one of my favorites . Friendly , warm , helpful staff and a comfortable el ##egan ##ce not found many other places . Le Bar is a great place to eat . You can order from the restaurant dinner menu and eat at the bar , enjoying the Chicago crowd . Food is always excellent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A quiet and spacious room in the heart of a r ##itz ##y neighborhood - great food , shopping and the lake ##front all within a few block radius . The hotel featured a great bar and the restaurant served lovely food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently spent 3 nights in this hotel . The room with a King bed was very large . We were pleasant ##ly surprised as the hotel said that we would have to pay for w ##if ##i , we would have to pay for a refrigerator and none of that was true . We had free w ##if ##i and a refrigerator and robes and a great view of Millennium Park . The items in the refrigerator were extremely price ##y , but we often ask the housekeeper to remove items and then we have room for water etc . We didn ' t care for the wings at the Columbus Ta ##p so we sent them back . The location is good but still plan on walking to get to various areas or you can take the E ##L . This hotel was a little price ##y but Lo ##lla ##pal ##lo ##oz ##a was here ( unfortunately ) and there was also a lawyer convention . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No room service or pool . Room was small but clean . Staff very at ##ten ##tive . A wonderful exposure to Chicago art Decca period . Bed was very comfortable . Over all enjoyable stay . Would book it again when I am in ch ##ica ##go [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is old and needs some up ##dating . Car ##pet was torn at the entry to the bathroom in my room . To ##ile ##t is too high off the floor if you are under 5 ' 5 " tall and the rooms have a mild ##ew smell to them . The front counter people were very nice but when I asked for assistance with problems in my room the other staff were very slow to respond . It would also be nice to have room service option when on a business trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I had the best time staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel over Valentine ' s Day weekend ! We decided to go with a corner suite which had an amazing view and was actually quite reasonable . The room was beautiful , elegant and very clean . The staff was awesome , especially Melissa who recommended some great Valentine ' s dinner ideas for us ! The location is perfect , very close to some of the best restaurants and bars in Chicago ! High ##ly recommend this hotel , it is one of my favorite places to stay in Chicago , for the quality , value and am ##bian ##ce ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was top notch . Hu ##ge wall mounted flat screen , N ##es ##press ##o coffee maker & best coffee I ' ve ever had in a hotel , compliment ##ary water every single day , Fr ##idge in room , lots of convenient plug ##s for electronics , great amenities in room . Bed , pillows - newer furnishings , built in wardrobe closet & drawers . This was really one of the nice ##st hotels I ' ve ever stayed in . The restaurant & bar area were a nice size and the food was very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##elle ##nt location , very nice breakfast , friendly and helpful staff makes this place very comfortable to stay , some of the rooms . are old but if you choose better q ##uil ##ity room it w ##il be in good standard . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve been to this hotel before , and I really liked it . However , this time , before I arrived I already checked in and chose the rooms for both me and my co - workers , but when I arrived , they changed our rooms and didn ' t even inform us till I asked . Also , the breakfast run out really fast , I was in the restaurant around 8 , and there is not even fruit anymore . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is old bottom line ; it needs major updates in rooms , general areas and could be cleaner . Our first room was a King and extremely small and very loud fan . I did ask to switch rooms and the second room was much more spacious . The staff is very nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and great location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am in Chicago regularly for business and this is my first choice . The Ki ##nz ##ie " gets it . " Stay ##ing here is easy . The location is perfect and the staff is exceptional . The way they handle breakfast is absolutely brilliant ! ! I can grab what I need and get back to my room and work or continue getting ready for my day . The night ##ly reception helps me un ##wind or get ready for a night on the town depending on my plans . I love the bout ##ique atmosphere . It ' s exactly what I want . This is truly my home away from home . I regularly recommend this hotel above all others . [SEP]
0	[CLS] You ’ ve probably seen the hidden camera investigative reports that revealed that house ##keeping often just r ##ins ##es and wipe ##s down glass ##ware in hotel rooms . I had kind of forgotten and put that out of my mind . However , it came flooding back when I found a coffee mug in my room with a few drops of coffee stain ##s inside and s ##me ##ared lip prints on the edge . I left it sitting out hoping it would be replaced with a clean one . I came back after my room being cleaned and found the exact same mug on the shelf with the same spots and same s ##me ##ared lip prints . I ##C ##K ! In these days of co ##rona ##virus , this is unacceptable ! Always wash your hotel glass ##ware yourself people ! Hotel was otherwise ok . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a te ##rri ##fic time in the O ##m ##ni for 3 nights last August . It was a very special family time for us travelling from Ireland . The staff were so friendly and helpful . . . thank you Carlos ; the bedrooms were spot ##less , comfortable and trend ##y ; the restaurant food and layout was second to none . Although we did not have time to use the pool it looked so tempting and a great asset to have on a city vacation . The location on Michigan avenue led us to great shops , the Hancock building , The Bean , the river tours , and great food venues too . The compliment ##ary taxi ride was a treat . Thank you again for a memorable vacation [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie is very well located , staff are friendly and helpful , the room was clean and pleasant ( and quiet ) . The breakfast is me ##h but it was set up by the elevators in the middle of the floor ( no need for shoes ! ) and it was really nice to be able to grab coffee and juice to take back to the room . We got a great rate and were very happy with our stay — we will certainly consider the Ki ##nz ##ie again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel over 5 days was generally speaking very enjoyable except for a few hi ##cc ##ups e ##g . the coffee maker was not working and no w ##if ##i being present for some time . However , the response time towards correct ##ing these problems was very swift . The staff were all very friendly and welcoming . As in most hotels of this rating in America , the breakfast ##s are usually of a Continental nature which was very disappointing but i guess this is the norm as described above so . . . . . From 5 - 7 ##pm there are free drinks and snack ##s for their guests in the lounge , which was quite plea ##sing . All in all no serious complaints and except for the breakfast , I wouldn ' t mind staying there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a room on the end . It was so nice and quiet . I could see the Chicago river walk from the window at the end of the hall and a nice view of the city from my room . It was close to local attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So I was forced to stay in Chicago because the winter storm practically shut down O ' Hare airport . So I looked up hotels and saw this reasonably priced one in downtown . Another bonus is that it was one half hour train ride away on the blue line . I walked into a very contemporary and clean hotel with nice service . I pretty much found my place to stay in Chicago next time I come into town . The view could ' ve been better . But I was on the 3rd floor , so I didn ' t expect much . They turned a crap ##py situation into a great night in a great town . That being said . . . GO L ##ION ##S GO T ##IG ##ER ##S GO P ##IS ##TO ##NS GO W ##ING ##S ! ! ! ! GO G ##RE ##EN GO W ##H ##IT ##E ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sign ##ificant hotel . Fantastic location , amazing breakfast ##s with live cooking and great service , nice gym . Room ##s are small ##ish and worn out but everything is functional and you don ' t spend that much time in the room anyway , when you ' re on Ma ##g mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service at this hotel is above and beyond . They use text and respond to any need immediately . The rooms are very new , clean , and extremely comfortable . Breakfast is continental and on every floor so you don ' t have to go far each morning if you are still waking up . Bell staff is the best . View wasn ' t the best but it more than made up for it in quiet ##ness of the rooms and beautiful and comfortable furnishings ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Intercontinental is convenient ##ly located within walking distance to many historic and popular restaurants and sites . The rooms are very comfortable , nicely appointed , and the staff were most helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time back to Chicago since 2012 , we decided to stay here even only for one night and glad we choose this hotel . We had a corner room , and view was f ##abulous When we come back to Chicago we will choose this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Me and my fi ##an ##cé live in the neighborhood and were experiencing p ##lum ##bing problems in our home . Not having any water was going to be a major problem in the morning so we decided to book a room last minute using tonight hotel . When we arrived to the hotel the reservation was not ready . Travis , one of the workers who work over night , was nice enough to buy us a a round a drinks while he looked for the reservation . He noticed we were in rough shape and was nice enough o upgrade us to a larger room for the night . What started out as bad morning turned into a great night . I can wait to find another excuse for a stay ##cation ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed overnight after the Rolling Stones show . Service at check in and out was great . Room was clean and nicely appointed . It was a nice luxury bout ##ique hotel . Co ##m ##fy bed and nice towels . Quiet . It really was a great room for a great price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we walked into the lobby for check - in , our stay at the Conrad was truly fl ##aw ##less and im ##ma ##culate . The hotel staff offered some of the best customer service I ' ve had in a long time , and definitely go above and beyond for their guests . Hospital ##ity at it ' s finest . The hotel is absolutely stunning , very clean , central ##ly located , and beautifully designed . The sleeping rooms were very spacious , high ceilings , top - notch amenities , and very comfortable . We loved every minute of our stay and can ' t wait to return one day ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location - was able to walk to just about everywhere we wanted to go . Fantastic and friendly service . Super clean and spacious room . Wonderful view of the city . High ##ly recommend if you ’ re looking for a top quality hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over a 30 day + period of time ( late June th ##ru early August ) , my wife and I stayed stayed twice at The Talbot Hotel for a total of 18 days . We found the a accommodation ##s to be quite comfortable . Every employee we encountered were a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , pleasant and helpful , when not even being asked . Ku ##dos to Dee , for his special attention to our breakfast q ##ui ##rks and to great guys behind the bar in the evening . If you are lucky you might even hear a solo or two ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service excellence , wonderful experience would stay again and again . Room was quiet and comfortable I was offered an upgrade at min charge . It was a welcome surprise and the food was delicious . Location was excellent [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the Talbot ##t Hotel for a long weekend . It ' s in a lovely neighborhood with great restaurants and bars within walking distance . The staff were friendly , helpful . The room was clean . We enjoyed our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Combined business and leisure travel into a wonderful experience . So ##fit ##el property is convenient ##ly located to business center and restaurant district . Service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble and Le ##B ##ar was a great way to start each evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We picked this hotel because it was a few minutes walk to the Chicago Theater for the Louis C ##K show and had some really nice restaurants nearby . The people at check - in were extra friendly and our room was larger than we expected . We had 6 PM dinner reservations so the early evening compliment ##ary wine bar was a pleasant surprise and we enjoyed sip ##ping wine in front of the lobby fireplace for 30 minutes before heading out into the f ##rig ##id January Chicago weather for dinner . Besides the excellent coffee in the lobby be sure to try the cu ##cum ##ber flavor ##ed water . The hotel W ##i - Fi was around $ 12 . 00 but it looked like if you joined their " club " with your email address it was free . We were not there long enough to bother with it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel with ex ##em ##p ##lary staff and f ##abulous location . Sit ##uated a few minutes walk from the best shopping and the Hancock Building , this hotel has it all . We took a one bedroom suite which had a large bedroom and living room with a huge marble bathroom ( Her ##mes products a bonus ! ) and our views from the 24th floor were phenomena ##l . The staff are friendly and at ##ten ##tive and house ##keeping is the best I ' ve ever experienced . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Talbot ##t for 2 weeks in April because I was performing in a show at the Broadway Playhouse . Since I was there for a while , I had a lot of requests to make my stay more comfortable . Ariel ##le at the front desk was so warm and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting every time we spoke . She was always kind no matter what time of day or night and went out of her way to be helpful . All of my needs and in ##quiries were taken care of with no problem . I would definitely recommend staying at the Talbot ##t and Ariel ##le for making my stay a very easy and enjoyable one ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bed and pillows were all amazing ##ly comfortable . The sitting area and desk were more than adequate . The bath was clean and spacious . Staff were persona ##ble and helpful . We booked through a travel site and had an overall great experience with the O ##m ##ni . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location - Walking distance to Michigan Ave . , the Pier , restaurants , the river walk and more . As far as the accommodation ##s , it was a pretty standard room . I had a nice view of the river but the p ##lum ##bing in my room was pretty loud . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It must be a great place to work , because everyone on staff seemed happy , friendly and welcoming . We were made to feel very comfortable and " at home " . Hope to return soon and stay longer . Chicago is f ##abulous ! Thanks [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here one night while in Chicago for business . It is a unique bout ##ique hotel in a restored old building . As it was only one night I did not get to experience all the hotel has to offer , but some comments I have are that the standard room is very small with a very small bathroom . I did have breakfast the hotel restaurant and I can say the food and service was excellent . The hotel definitely had character . I would stay at the hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would definitely recommend the O ##m ##ni Chicago but only unfortunately there was no working fan or ventilation in the bathroom and the only mirror was positioned in the bathroom ! With 3 females sharing the room this was impossible ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a wonderful experience at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in Chicago . All members of the hotel staff were court ##eous and helpful . Melissa Dr ##iza , the Guest Services Manager and Chief Con ##cier ##ge , provided exceptional customer service . I enjoyed the compliment ##ary Continental Breakfast offered everyday , as well as the Lounge located on the 5th floor . The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is located in a very convenient location , close to shopping , and near very fine restaurants and eat ##eries . My room was very quiet and kept very clean by the friendly hotel staff . Also , the fitness center on the 5th floor is pretty good . When I return to Chicago , I will stay at the K ##I ##nz ##ie Hotel once again ! Thanks again Melissa . [SEP]
1	[CLS] O ##m ##ni hotel was a very nice place to stay . The room was very clean and attractive . The door man was very helpful and knowledge ##able . The location is great to get around the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile to Navy Pier . The br ##unch at 67 ##6 Restaurant was absolutely f ##abulous and the French To ##ast is too die for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff here ( especially Cassie at Re ##ception desk ) made all the difference for our stay . I always choose Kim ##pton when I can , and honestly had tried to book at other Chicago Kim ##pton sites before choosing All ##egro ( based on having stayed in other properties , and on location ) but because of Cassie ' s accommodation of our need to change to a larger room , All ##egro became one of my favorite hotels . The location is great for getting around the city , taking train to W ##rig ##ley Field , etc ; not so good for restaurants nearby on weekends . If possible , I suggest you book a premium / larger room . Regardless , the staff here is amazing and makes the effort to meet your needs . The lobby is a great place to hang out , have a drink , and feel welcome and comfortable at all times . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel in an iconic building has a surprisingly welcoming and even intimate feel . The staff is excellent and the location could not be better , as you ' re right at the junction of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and the Loop , with a Nord ##strom ' s right across the street for any unexpected travel ##er ' s needs like a tie or umbrella . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very spacious room with beautiful views of the city . The reception people were very helpful and helped us choose the places to visit and places to eat out . It was a very pleasant experience . There was a conference taking place at that time and I was told they always have lots of conferences throughout the year [SEP]
1	[CLS] G ##reta city to walk around . State St has plenty of shopping or just window shopping . Get down to the w ##harf as it ' s nice and they ' ve built great structure almost the entire way . P ##lent ##y of tour , museums , and of course pizza . We did it all in 3 full days . I did get pick pocket ##ed at the airport so watch your wallet ! If you ' re a walk ##er , this hotel is fine as class ##y , not a fortune and well located . You can take the train to within a block or two of the hotel and it ' s far cheaper ( unless you lose your wallet ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For a 4 star hotel I feel disappointed there wasn ##t at least a fridge or microwave for left overs . Being on vacation the hotel was the only place to store food . Had to throw away left overs from a 5 star steak house . Called and asked about a fridge and was not offered one . Wine spots on the bed comfort ##er . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel w ##ows you , especially if you are going in from Michigan Ave entrance , it is not in - your - face l ##ux ##uries like so many other hotels these days but luxury in a noble , state ##ly way ( think queen Elizabeth ) . Most employees we encountered were happy , friendly & eager to help , Miss Miss ##y who checked us in was enthusiastic about the hotel as much as a 1st time ##r like me ! You could tell she ( & most employees ) was proud to work in this place . Stay ##ing in Hilton Chicago gives you a very pleasant & kind of “ body & soul ” right feeling . We would definitely come back , thank you & keep up the work ! Oh for a beautiful place like this , I wish all guests learn to dress properly but to the hotel credit , it doesn ’ t disc ##rim ##inate , such a rare luxury yet friendly hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sisters and I came for a weekend with our elderly parents . The service at the hotel from booking to check out was excellent . One of the best hotel experiences ever . The front desk staff were consistently friendly , efficient , and helpful . I can ' t recommend highly enough the gold lounge staff . We took full advantage of the amenities , and the staff were exceptional , particularly the evening team . They were friendly , helpful , and kind , remembering us every time we walked in . My husband and I stayed at the Fair ##mont last May and were impressed then , but now we will look nowhere else when we come to Chicago in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Room ##s were im ##ma ##culate with a great view . Breakfast was fresh and staff extremely friendly . Wen ##t to the evening social and it was really nice . Great food and company . Being a Hilton Honors Member gave me a couple of per ##ks which were a nice surprise . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gorge ##ous hotel ! Excellent service . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed and pillows . Beautiful pool and 2 hot tub ##s . Hu ##ge exercise room with plenty of equipment . Sa ##una ##s in men ' s and women ' s locker rooms . Great location on millennium Park [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice location in northern Chicago with restaurants in walking distance . Not in the loop . Room ##s have poor lighting and insufficient wall outlets . Room size varies . Stock ##ed mini fridge and snack ##s in room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love it ! We really enjoyed the stay . The breakfast and dinner was really good . The room was really clean and spacious . The staff was really friendly and helpful . We really enjoyed our stay . De ##fin ##ite ##ly we come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel in a great location for a great price . It ' s rare to have all three of these criteria fulfilled simultaneously . The rooms are spacious and comfortable . The mini kitchen is f ##abulous for a long weekend or extended stay . The fridge is very large for a hotel and great for left ##overs . The location is f ##abulous for restaurants and shopping . It ' s an easy walk to Michigan Ave . I can ' t think of a better place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently stayed at the Public for one night while I was in Chicago on business . Overall am ##bie ##nce is really cool , clean and modern . I really liked the overall aesthetic of the room . In town for just one night , I needed a place to din ##e at alone and still feel comfortable , Trevor Howard , who works at front desk , recommended an amazing Chinese restaurant that was in a part of town I would not have ventured to otherwise . T ##ruly great little experience . Can ' t wait to be back in Chicago . Will definitely recommend to family and friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Here for a conference . Room was re ##mo ##del ##ed recently it appeared and clean . House ##keeping staff need some training though as they were often yelling back at forth at each other and using pro ##fan ##ity as they were cleaning . This place is huge with al ##ot of elevators but they need a bit better label ##ing on which ones go to which floors as it isn ' t immediately apparent . Overall a good stay and good location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Looking for a great location and places to eat and experience Chicago foods without leaving the hotel ? This is it ! A quick walk to Mill ##eni ##um Park and Michigan Ave . Beautiful views surrounding the hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about our stay was great . The service , the friendly atmosphere , the food and drinks . The rooms are on the small side but I honestly prefer it that way . We don ' t need a lot of space so for a couple it was perfect . A + + [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently completed Route 66 and started in Chicago . We decided to spend 4 nights here before we picked up our car to explore Chicago . This hotel was superb , great location , luxury rooms , nice food and bar . The only down ##side is w ##if ##i is only free in the lobby but we didn ' t need it much so that was perfect for us . High ##ly recommend . Alex & Ray , England . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a spectacular building in a wonderful location . Every member of the staff I encountered - - front desk , bar , house ##keeping - - was thorough and professional . But there were a few mad ##den ##ing oversight ##s . There were no s ##ter ##ile wipe ##s in the gym . There was no way to clean heads ##ets ( other than replacing ear cushion ##s ) and no place to either deposit used sets or collect new ones . I went to the business center to print a plane ticket and found a ) that the printer was jammed ( I cleared it ) , and b ) that someone who had used the machine before had 50 + pages in the que ##ue , all catalog copy and shipping labels . What should have been a three - minute job became a 20 - minute job . Neither of these was a huge deal , but they ' re surprising oversight ##s at an otherwise wonderful hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautifully maintained , service was friendly , helpful and quick and the location is ideal ! Central ##ly positioned on Michigan Ave in the heart of the shopping , eating and site seeing district . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have to give a big thanks to Rosemary in house ##keeping for being so friendly and asking if I needed extra towels and accommodate ##d me when I asked if room can be cleaned at certain time . The rest of the staff was friendly too . The restaurant was good but was not as good as the hotel , there seems to be a dip in service and friend ##liness between the two . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel stay in the upper level suites that were newly renovated and beyond f ##abulous ! Love ##d the lobby bar as well . The restaurant ( The Palm ) service , food , drinks all 5 star ! The work ##out floor blew me away it ' s so sleek and new with the most modern design and equipment * p ##elo ##nton bikes , interactive spinning classes ! If you stay in the presidential suite for just one night you will be blown away ! Great views of the city . . the general manager Ted Se ##log ##ie is the friend ##liest , most professional smiling person ever ! Great experience . Must stay when I return to Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location , good food in the hotel restaurant Lock ##wood and the on ##site sport ##´s bar Potter ##´s . A green and red line stop are very close by . Millennium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago are in easy walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my third stay at The So ##fit ##el , and my best . Our room was on the newly renovated 32nd floor . The staff is lovely and eager to assist with anything you ask . My only issue , and it is very small , would be that the lighting in our room was so dark . At age 55 , I need a little more light ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had the pleasure of staying at the Fair ##mont Chicago from 5th - 9th December & we were not disappointed . The service was simply magnificent from all in the Gold Lounge which is a ##bly led by the very friendly & professional Cody Cook & his super team where absolutely nothing was too much trouble , it truly was a home away from home . The location is perfect being just opposite Millennium Park & there is so much to see & do in Chicago even in [UNK] Thank ##yo ##u Fair ##mont Chicago & especially Cody Cook & all the staff in the Gold Lounge who exceeded our expectations . The Burns Family Adelaide Australia [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 9 nights in August great hotel clean staff friendly good location just around the corner from the ma ##g mile and an 5 minute walk to the beach and lake front Lincoln park an 20 minute walk away would definitely return when we visit Chicago again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Great location - the hotel was close to shopping and restaurants . We could walk to most everything we wanted to do or see . Our room was average but clean with a nice bathroom that had a tub and walk in shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby was beautiful and all decorated in Christmas s ##ple ##ndo ##r . I felt as though I was transported back in time to the 20 ' s and 30 " s Our stay was during the Thanksgiving holiday . The food was great ! The rooms were old and small , The room service was not good at all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able and clean , this particular location is right in the center of the city and within walking distance of everything necessary . P ##F Chang ##s right at your feet when you walk out the door . Star ##bu ##cks is also across the Street . The v ##alet service is a little price ##y but they will definitely take care of you . Overall a very positive experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bo ##uti ##que style avant - garde property located in the theatre district . Con ##ven ##ient location near great restaurants , including 312 for Italian on site . High energy lobby bar . Good value . Great customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We made a quick overnight stay here at the end of our long vacation . It ' s comfortable and ideal ##ly located for some sights ##ee ##ing . Friendly and knowledge ##able bell hop ##s , particularly Mike from County Mayo . All in all it ' s typically She ##rato ##n . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of my favorite places to stay in Chicago . The rooms are small , but the atmosphere and service is outstanding . This was recently red ##ec ##ora ##ted and maintains is classic art de ##co style . Close to theaters , the river and walking distance to downtown . Ad ##ja ##cent 312 restaurants serves consistently great food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just attended a four - day event at She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago from 9 - 12 July 2017 and could not have been more happier with the location , as I was traveling from India . I was upgraded by my hosts to a Suite with a beautiful view of the river and lake - it made my trip . Being able to look out at the lake ( rather a sea ) was simply soothing . The slender modern buildings , the s ##tro ##ll on the river ##walk and boats on the lake made the business trip feel like a holiday ! I now look forward to a real holiday at Grand She ##rato ##n Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] You can never go wrong with a Conrad . And the staff here are really on top of things . Had a standard king room this time but standard here is quite satisfactory . I ’ m pick ##y about bathroom ##s and I love their bathroom ##s . I ’ ve stayed in a sky ##line suite here , and if you get the chance , you should . It ’ s a great view , a beautiful room ( s ) and nice ##r than my apartment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were so pleased with the treatment by the hotel staff . We felt like valued customers . From the moment we went to the 20th floor we felt welcomed . Never had to open to door to come in the building or leave for the day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was a little older but that ' s not a criticism ; part of its charm . A great location right on Michigan Avenue on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Nice top shelf amenities in the rooms which were clean and con ##fort ##able . A V ##ER ##Y friendly and helpful staff . Access ##ible to wherever you might want to go . Dec ##ent , if typical hotel dining options including the Michael Jordan St ##eak House . Would stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel and very convenient to everything . Front desk customers service was very helpful and very nice . They ’ ve answered every question I had asked and they were awesome . Room ##s were very clean and spacious . House ##keeper was very pleasant and she did an awesome job cleaning the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room I was in definitely needed up ##grading - - the carpet was stained , the paint job in the bathroom seemed un ##p ##ro ##fe ##ssion ##al . W ##orse , the room was dirty : wiping down the shelf in front of the TV left a black ##ened hand ##print on the c ##lor ##ox wipe . The bathroom was also dirty , including in the tub . I wouldn ' t recommend this place , except for the front desk staff , who were always pleasant and helpful . Wait until it ' s refurbished , which in my opinion needs to be done soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are H ##hon ##ors came to c ##el ##bra ##te our anniversary we got a tiny room no view tiny bed and p ##eel ##ing doors f ##au ##ce ##ts old f ##ac ##ilt ##y , nice old building poor customer service and no welcoming . . . . Just ask for extra for everything just no - simply don ##t go there ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visit Chicago every year at Christmas Time and always stay at the Talbot ##t . The staff is the best , especially D ##wayne and Charles . The location is very near many fine restaurants and Michigan Avenue shopping . Al ##way a nice way to start the Holiday ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Written this twice and app crashed so will be brief . Outside of hotel - P ##lea ##sing to pull up to especially after long travel , people on the ball to help with bags . They don ' t take them to your room though . Staff - Fantastic and nothing too big or small to deal with . Girl noticed we were on honeymoon and upgraded our room for free . Inside of hotel - Quite stunning with cocktail bar inside ( happy hour too ) . Room was great , lovely view and a safe to keep your stuff in . One of the elevators broke down though so sometimes we had long que ##ues ( I ' m not walking up 11 floors ) . Free w ##if ##i . Great stay over all ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First , great hotel room . The Royal Suite was spectacular ! Two big rooms , a little spread out . . . . but nice . Bath ##room was huge . Nice separate soaking tub with amazing view of downtown . No issues with physical property . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ing side was on the human front . Overall customer service was average to poor . Just never felt like they had the back of a Hilton Diamond member . No personality at the front desk . Too ##k our number to let us know when room would be available . . . . . and never received a text or call . When we finally checked in later that night . . . . . person at front desk said bags were in the room . Nothing in room ! I travel all the time . . . . . so it takes a lot to push me over the edge - i was over the edge ! Unfortunately , will not return . Maybe we caught them on a bad day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed overnight at the Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco Chicago on March 7th . I was in town with a childhood friend who had never been to Chicago . Gwen at the front desk made sure that his first trip to Chi - Town was memorable . We stayed on the 11th floor with a river view and a window seat big enough to sleep on . The room was very clean and spacious . The door ##man and bell ##hop were very friendly and court ##eous . I ’ m definitely looking forward to bringing the Mrs . back for her birthday in a few weeks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The girls at the front desk were great ( Cassie , Michelle Leah ) . They did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable . They made the check - in process easy , they were willing to help secure the things I forgot to pack , The hotel is very convenient to the River area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We came to the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for the weekend and had a pleasant stay . It is close to everything including great places to eat ! The staff is super and loved the happy hour . The breakfast is a continental one so we did go out for a . It bigger . It ’ s to eat but it su ##ff ##ices to get you going . We will be back . : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay here every time we visit Chicago , which is often . Best value in town . S ##pect ##ac ##ular feather beds . Top floors have been renovated and are very nice . Staff is superb as is the bar and the restaurant , especially breakfast . Great location and now A T ##ru ##luck ##s across the street ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This corner room was amazing . I really liked the style , way furniture was placed . Absolutely felt like a queen . The view was spectacular . I did find it strange to come into the hotel , then need to take the elevator to a different floor to check in . The hot tub was very nice , as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Palmer House and was woken up in the middle of the night with this bed bug on me . I called security and the bug was still there when they arrived . They treated my luggage in their bed bug station and moved me to a second rooms which had blood on the wall . They moved me to a third room . By this time I was incredibly upset because I had a job interview the next day and had no sleep . I filed a claim for re ##im ##bur ##se ##ment with the hotel and they denied my claim stating that I failed to prove there were bed bugs . Keep in mind that I had a photo , their own employee saw it , and they hauled off all of my luggage and treated it . I went through hell and wasn ' t even apologized to or re ##im ##bur ##sed . I will never stay at a Hilton again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice older hotel with quiet rooms and excellent staff , especially Craig . Could not do enough to help us . Excellent location for shopping and access to Millennium Park . At ##e a ta ##sty and high quality breakfast in the Nix Cafe . We definitely plan to return . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first visit to the Talbot ##t Hotel in Chicago . I was there for business and my reservation made by meeting coordinator . I plan on using the hotel for my trips I make to Chicago for social reasons . D ##wayne was exceptionally helpful , not to mention cheerful , at both check in and check out . My only suggestion would be go get more comfortable beds . . . not terrible but not a pillow top type bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice . Conference rate not bad considering . For personal nights used third party site for reasonable rate . Location is great for Navy pier , river area , park , theater . Easy access to train for trip to W ##rig ##ley , Long walk to museums . Room was nice , view was nice . Hotel nice and located close to some shopping and restaurants . Staff friendly and helpful . Would go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely amazing location and the staff is very helpful . I just think that this place needs some love as the rooms look like they are from the 80s . The rooms were clean but boy , the furniture is well worn . Likewise with the bed ##ding . Overall , the location makes up for the very average rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location . No issues with service . Looks good on the outside and lobby . But badly in need of a re ##mo ##del . Not very clean . Car ##pet ##s were awful . The vent in my room had at least an inch of cake ##d up dust . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although I did not see a lot of familiar faces from my last visit a year ago , one did stick out from last Summer . Travis , the manager of Guest Relations went above and beyond to make sure my family and I were more than comfortable . The rooms are better than ever and it feels like the hotel was " brought back to life " from the condition it was in last year . Thank you so much for everything , Travis ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First trip to Chicago , stayed 7 nights and I loved it . Very central to everything . Staff were ultra friendly , everyone had a smile from door ##men to house ##keeping . Room ##s are large , great that it has both a bath tub and separate shower cubic ##le . My tub however had a sand ##paper bottom ! I know it ’ s a non slip surface but mine was extra - rough ! I know this because my niece and nephew also stayed there , in their own rooms , and theirs weren ’ t so a ##bra ##sive : ) didn ’ t worry me too much though . Restaurant ##s are expensive like most hotels , but there ’ s plenty of places to walk to . Fr ##idge and co ##ff ##fe ##e maker in the rooms were welcome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] . . . unless you want to be sick from the over ##powering fake pine smell they somehow feel is f ##estive . In this day and age where people suffer from all ##er ##gies and respiratory issues , this is just down right ridiculous . It ' s so strong , you can literally smell it outside of the hotel . Talk about over ##kill . Factor in rude front desk , uncomfortable beds and me ##dio ##cre house ##keeping , for what they charge a night ? Not worth it . If you want to be close to shopping and attractions , this is a good location . That ' s the only positive thing I can say about it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Whenever I stay at a Kim ##pton hotel , I wonder why I don ' t look for them in other places . This one ( as they all are ) was sleek , modern and comfortable . The room was a nice size . W ##if ##i is free if you sign up for their rewards program ( also free . ) The bathroom amenities are nice . The yoga mat in the room and compliment ##ary wine happy hour are great extra ##s . This hotel is convenient ##ly located . Service is friendly . They seemed a little overwhelmed by all the people at check ##out but the woman behind the desk was quick . Nice job . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this location , only place my family and I stay at downtown . From the front desk , house ##keeping , helpful engineers and food & beverage team , every single encounter they ' re willing to help . The views from our room are hard to beat . The location is clean & near so many restaurants . The front desk had helped us book reservations at Eddy V ' s which the live jazz & mouth water ##ing food was just what we needed . Thank you Home ##wood , can ' t wait to be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] We was to a point of separation and we decided to take a get ##away and it ' s been like a hole new start . . we r back to being a team and a family . . the room was amazing the view was the hole reason we enjoyed it and the bed was so ##oo ##o comfortable and the pillows was like clouds of amazing ##ness . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is so well located , you can take the blue line from the airport straight here and it ’ s a 4 min walk , with no changes . You are also so close to the river and next door to Les Mi ##ser ##ables show at the moment , it ’ s easy to get around by walking or on the bus from here . Room ##s are nice and free pro ##sse ##co goes down well every day at 5 ##pm . Great Art Dec ##o feel High ##ly recommended [SEP]
0	[CLS] 10 / 10 . The Talbot Hotel delivers comfort and style with a small hotel feel , while still being professional and efficient . My Chicago choice of a ##cco ##mo ##dation , as it is fair value for the level of service and facilities available very comfortable ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very nice hotel that is currently under a ' be ##aut ##ification process ' ( they are de ##cor ##ating at the moment ) . I have certainly been to a number of hotels that are in far more desperate need of decoration . The room was very minimal ##ist in its style , everything is white . The amenities are were all there with a great shower and a heavily stock ##ed mini ##bar if required . The public spaces were stunning , well worth visiting if you ' re in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just love this place ! I ' ve been staying here for many years and always enjoy it . Great rooms and very comfortable beds . The staff is amazing . . . from the door ##man that greet ##s you when you get out of your cab / U ##ber to the cleaning staff they are all top notch ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n is a beautiful hotel in a great location , but some things fell short with me . I ' m personally just not a fan of how more expensive hotels don ' t include many amenities . Be prepared to pay at least $ 50 for self - parking and no continental breakfast as with most ups ##cale places . The interior of the rooms are also in need of an update . Our room at a Hampton Inn in Kentucky had a much more updated bathroom at a fraction of the cost . However , the views are amazing & room service is good albeit extremely expensive ( again , this isn ' t uncommon for a hotel of this caliber ) . We were able to get some nice pictures in front of our window with the city ##sca ##pe in the background . I would stay again , but only if I found a good deal on a room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff made the stay so special ! They were friendly and so happy to serve their guests . Staff went above and beyond . . . when I realized I had forgotten my coat in my car that the v ##alet had parked the day before , they went to get it for me and had it to me within minutes . At ##e at the restaurant once and it was great . Location is super close to theaters , restaurants and shopping . Room is spacious and decorated beautifully . I could occasionally hear street noise ( ho ##nking ) and floor noises from next room but couldn ’ t hear TV or conversations . For the most part , very quiet . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a great value . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Chicago , Illinois magnificent mile Home ##wood Suite ##s was not up to my standards for heating and being better off comfortable emotionally and for moving with joy and strength for my spiritual health too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is f ##abulous . Perfect location to get around . All staff was outstanding and so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Very professional . Chris at the front desk . D ##wayne the Door ##man really made my stay even more perfect . I can ##t say enough good things about this place and staff . Thanks Talbot ##t for an outstanding stay . The C ##rain ’ s [SEP]
0	[CLS] Alfred Bat ##io provided very court ##eous service during our departure from Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago . We had a small hang ##up with house keeping , but he made it up to us with a ta ##sty lunch . This kind of service will keep us returning to your hotels . The hotel is lovely , modern ##ized , and in a great location . Have a wonderful summer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt has a awesome app that allowed me to check in , check out and have my key all from my phone . It was super easy to use which made my stay very easy . The app had other features to see what amenities that location offered and learn about the area I was staying in . GE ##T THE AP ##P ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has great beds and pillows ! ! ! ! Every thing about this hotel was excellent . Great breakfast and you get a lot for the money . Location was perfect . Will be back to stay again for another get ##away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing per se wrong with the establishment , but I wouldn ' t say it truly ex ##cel ##s in any area either . Room was clean , but quite boring and lifeless . Hang ##ers in the bathroom weren ' t tightly screwed and they were dangling from the wall as if the light ##est load will be too much for them . Show ##er head was funny and hard to operate . Breakfast was quite terrible ( if you are staying there , go to the 3rd Coast which is just 100 ##m away ) . Staff is indeed helpful . Nevertheless , an average hotel with an average experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Management and staff were great at addressing any concerns , in a professional manner . I would suggest if you are considering the Ma ##gni ##fi ##que Breakfast , that you go ahead and skip it . Personal ##ly , the savings does not e ##qua ##te to the value . For instance , the menu items seemed to be a con ##den ##sed version of the full breakfast menu ; the coffee tasted one step above F ##ol ##gers and the fresh squeezed juice ##s may have been fresh squeezed when put into their respective cart ##on , but were by no means fresh squeezed at the hotel . Take a note from the So ##fit ##el in Montreal or Manila . Being a holiday , the hotel was also extremely short - staffed in the restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , although many of the sights are around or below the river . We took a suite but this was a lot smaller than Hilton suites that I have stayed in , in other cities . But it was clean , and the staff were friendly . We had pretty much the same room maid for the week and she was awesome - always made sure that we had towels and sheets , despite our random diary ! Good hotel and very central - highly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had such a great time . A friend met us and brought some wine , and we realized there was already glasses and a bottle opener in the room which was smart and convenient . The room was on the top floor with the most amazing view and came complete with a little living room area that was nice to hang out in . They even included extra sheets and a pillow in case anyone decides to crash on the couch which I thought was a nice touch . For the am ##ent ##ities , the pool was relaxing and not over ##crow ##ded with kids and I had to call v ##alet to grab a pair of heels I forgot in my car and they did so politely and with super speed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast and free drinks at happy hour ! Our room was nice , large enough , and clean . The bathroom was large and had a lot of counter space . Great location , walking distance to many sites , restaurants and bars . Staff was very friendly . We would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very q ##ua ##int bout ##ique style hotel . The service is amazing . The Sweet Water restaurant and bar area is comfortable and delicious ! The service is fantastic . The rooms are large and very clean . The location is perfect . Excellent value for your money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t book this hotel . I booked a night and same day just one hour after i ' ve canceled it because i had an accident . Book ##ing was 5 days after ! ! They refused to re ##fu ##nd me , to change my date , and they re ##sel ##l my room to another person ( They win 2 times money on this room ) . Not professional , ego ##ists , if you have a problem they don ' t care , they could change my reservation for another day , but no , they prefer ##ed keep my money and re ##sel ##l my room to win more . Di ##s ##gus ##ting ( and i just read on Google I ' m not the first client to have this problem ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fair ##mont ' s are almost always my hotel of choice but this one was nothing but disappointing . The service was rude and s ##not ##ty . We were a family with two kids and had to ask numerous times for the pack and play , among other things . Breakfast was included in our room rate but they didn ' t mention it , I had to make sure to ask about it and then got attitude cause I wanted free breakfast . S ##pen ##d your money somewhere else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was excellent : the amenities , the sheet count , the am ##bian ##ce all great . If you are a diamond member : the credit is $ 30 for breakfast . The cost of a simple toast p ##latter , juice and coffee is about $ 35 ( this is not what I think about with Conrad ) . The breakfast restaurant seems separate from the hotel : so the service is really NO ##T great . I was there for two days , and you have got to wait , and be nice to the waiter ##s to get service . No pro ##active service . R ##oof ##top restaurant is nice and has good food : Japanese inspired cuisine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful room with 3 windows . The hotel is in a wonderful neighborhood near public transportation and a lovely Cafe . The staff are amazing ##ly friendly and kind . Kay at the front desk is the B ##ES ##T ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed their with our family of 4 a few times now and have never had any complaints . Room ##s are always clean , the help from the front door till the day you leave is always super friendly . Location is always perfect for the activities we have planned . They have a strict quiet policy which is great . . we have never had the crazy kids running around down the halls or in the room above us screaming . I would recommend the hotel to anyone [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was lovely and large . We had a suite that included 2 beds and a separate room with a pull ##out couch and table . The view was great . A little bit of the city to the right and straight ahead was the lake . All staff was very friendly and helpful . A ##wes ##ome stay . I will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All I can say is that this hotel went out of their way to make our stay very memorable and enjoyable . . Hat ##s off to Alice ##a and Melissa for making sure our stay was A G ##RE ##AT ONE . . text ##ing us through out our 3 day stay . . to make sure everything was Perfect . . They even made sure we got home ok . . we felt like they really had our best interests at hand ! ! So Thank You . . We will be back soon ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights while we were in Chicago for a conference . The hotel is in a great location . Easy to walk to major attractions . The staff was excellent . Very helpful and at ##ten ##tive . The room was lovely and clean . We slept very well . The only down ##side was that we did not have a nice view or window seat , but that was expected as we did not reserve a river ##view room . The free wine hour was great and was the free w ##if ##i if you sign up for their rewards program . We also took advantage of the free bikes you can borrow . They give you a helmet and lock to use . We took a wonderful bike ride along the lake . I would definitely stay here or at another Kim ##pton property again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My children ( 13 and 9 ) , my mother and I spent a long weekend at this hotel . We found the location super close to the wonderful shopping on the magnificent mile to get us to great food and shops quickly , but far enough off the mile to avoid the chaos and noise . The rooms were comfortable and clean , albeit a ta ##d smaller than I ’ m used to . The staff was wonderful and kind , even with a full house due to a Star Wars convention taking place . Only very small negative was v ##alet as the staff didn ’ t communicate the status to the line leaving everyone a ta ##d put off , but using the text services meant my car arrived quickly despite being 7th in line . We did not eat or drink at the hotel because there were so ##oo many ta ##sty options within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Conrad - Chicago over Labor Day weekend . The hotel is beautiful , not even a year old . Very spacious room , great bathroom with double sinks and a large shower . The location is wonderful . Michigan Avenue , Rush Street area , and all of River North are around you . We tried the restaurant for lunch and had a great b ##urger . We stopped at the roof top bar after dinner . What a beautiful spot . Good views of Michigan Avenue and the city . There was a nice gas fire pit seating area too . We brought our bikes with us and they glad ##ly stored them for us . Only negative was $ 70 for overnight parking . We skipped that and used Spot Hero to find another lot nearby and paid half the cost . We will definitely come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent a week in Chicago and stayed at the O ##m ##ni . It was money well spent : the mini - suite we occupied was very comfortable . The bed was super good - I haven ' t slept so well in a long time . The water was always hot . The TV had all the channels we wanted . The view down to Michigan Avenue was great . The black ##out blind ##s worked great . Our neighbors were loud in the corridors and the cleaning staff were a little too eager to get going early in the morning , though . The door staff were always very friendly and helpful with directions . The reception was very helpful and efficient . The O ##m ##ni is in a great location and very close to two Metro stops . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was great and in a convenient part of town . The hotel was not too f ##uss ##y with a nice contemporary feel . It felt efficient and not stuff ##y . However , a couple of minor points : The amount of cushion ##s on my bed was ridiculous and I had to sweep them off to get in , suspect my wife would would have liked it but for me they just got in the way . The shower was lacking a little pressure as I always like a good strong flow . Would stay again as the room rate for central Chicago was reasonable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the time you enter to the time you leave , every aspect of this hotel is five star . The rooms , the staff , the restaurant and the newly refurbished bar all are excellent . We feel the staff treats you as family ! ! All good ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Older grand Hotel right in middle of all action of Chicago ! ! Good holiday get away great time and weather was good ! ! We have done X - mass trip with Kids for 5 years now always stayed at Inter - continental ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is two blocks from Hancock tower . The building itself has an architecture design that makes the hotel a very attractive place to be . The location is perfect , the staff is very friendly and I would recommend this place to everyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friends had stayed at this hotel before on business and highly recommended it . Very competitive rates . Central . Very nice rooms with views . Re ##com ##men ##d getting a room on higher floors . Great free coffee in the morning , and free wine with small bites between 5 and 6 PM . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On the Chicago river the She ##rato ##n Grand is a good spot to stay . Close to the Navy Pier and walk ##able to many downtown spots . The hotel has 4 levels and 34 floors . You arrive on level 3 with level one being the river walk and 2 and 4 being primarily meeting rooms . The hotel is the home of Shu ##la ’ s which has great steak ##s and is connected to the lobby . At check in they seemed to expand as traffic increased so never was there an excessive line . Charlotte was my agent and she was fantastic . Except ##ional ##ly o ##bs ##er ##vant and friendly , she handled my check ##in very professionally . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pick ##ed this hotel due to location and room quality . Central downtown location close to shopping bars and restaurants . Very good service from the bell ##boy to the room service . Room ##s are big , clean , very functional , quiet with comfortable bed . Good bathroom , only shower could improve . Bar is OK , ta ##sty bar food . Overall very good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted in the cold month of January the Bell man are amazing the front desk staff care . This will the only Hilton I have stayed at . This was a business decision but the lobby is s ##ty ##lish and it can get overwhelming so be careful where u wonder [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at the Fair ##mont Millennium Park was a tale of two trips . In Chicago for business and the hotel was directly next to the conference . The staff were friendly and helpful and the restaurant was perfect for breakfast every morning . Unfortunately the building and rooms are in serious need of an upgrade . I also had an important package sent to me at the hotel and paid for shipping only to find out I had to pay an additional $ 10 fee just to the hotel business center for them to release my package . Twice the delivery charge I paid to Fed ##E ##x . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ing to say the least . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently had occasion to stay at your property at the time of the 2019 Chicago Marathon . We assumed that the bottle ##d water available in the room - since it was clearly marked " Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary " was in fact , free or n / c . Mark ##ing the water as : compliment ##ary and then having the gal ##l to charge $ 15 / day for it is ta ##cky , di ##sing ##en ##uous , and une ##thical . we will not be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great size rooms and service . Central location is perfect for theater and park . Just a hike to Navy Pier . Very at ##ten ##tive staff . Fitness room had P ##elo ##ton bike . A ##wes ##ome opportunity to experiment with system . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We upgraded to a Business room and it was well worth it . We were on the 19th floor and had plenty of space and were able to keep our window open at night for fresh air . the feel of the hotel is elegant , and the lobby is im ##ma ##culate . We could always stop at the bar for a drink or just to lounge until our next activity . Location is great for just about anything sight seeing you want to do . We would definitely stay here again ! Staff and con ##cier ##ge are extremely helpful ! ! thank you for a luxurious and comfortable stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in a perfect corner where the r ##ive flows and a block from Michigan avenue which is the best to shop . . . It is clean , quiet , very comfortable , and above all , the rooms are funk ##y . . I love the windows , the si ##ll is a huge padded area where you can bring the bottle of wine and watch the outside world go by . . . Perfect romantic platform . I was here for New Year ' s plus one . We never left the room ! ! ! Much recommended . V ##isi ##t Macy ' s down the block on state street for some great ##s sales . It ' s a bit price ##y but worth it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , only a two block walk to Millennium Park and the Bean . Nice River view . Friendly staff , clean and ups ##cale . Found the P ##ed ##way accessible right from the hotel so didn ' t have to get out in the rain to have dinner . Very happy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this hotel for my family of 4 and it was terrible services . . . Forget about early check in it ' s never available . . . I asked for extra towels when we first checked in never got them until when we came back to the room after 10 ##pm . . . asked for a co ##rks ##cre ##w to borrow never received it . . . asked for paper towel received toilet paper . . . not to mention the beds are terribly low and uncomfortable . . . we booked this room for 3 nights needles ##s to say we left after the first night and went and spent money else where . . . I don ' t see how this hotel is considered a 4 star at all [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had to move rooms two times , until they got it right . . . and they did . The rooms are getting to be run ##down and may need an overhaul soon . If I get a room with a view , not sure why they decided to move the furniture around so that the back of the head ##board faces the window and the view . It is a very busy hotel with very high prices for drinks and eating , but in a great location that is close to everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wasn ' t sure what to expect since we got this hotel room at the last minute but were pleasant ##ly surprised by the modern look of the room . It was small but very comfortable . The bed was comfortable and the sheets were crisp . Nice touch screen monitor in the room that directed us around the area . Love ##d the sliding glass doors of the bathroom - - nice touch ! ! There is a parking garage across from the hotel at 42 . 00 a night ( which we didn ' t know ahead of time ) . only negative was to have to pay for w ##if ##i . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have really enjoyed my short stay at this hotel . Although it is still under renovation on the outside , the inside of the hotel is gorgeous , clean and co ##zy . The room is comfortable with ample space and the shower is beautifully tile ##d . Dec ##or aside , I am especially pleased with their customer service . A big shout out to D ##wayne , their bell ##man : ) he ’ s always at ##ten ##tive , friendly and enthusiastic and is always happy to suggest things to do , places to din ##e , etc ! A smile and a high 5 really help boost morale and really go a long way ! This was my first time to Chicago and I certainly would like to come back for longer next time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved this hotel ! From the personal ##ized service at check in to the little extra ##s everywhere - the happy hour , a y ##um ##my breakfast , coffee in the room , a refrigerator - this hotel cannot be beaten . The bed was comfortable , the couch / seating area by the window was nice , there was plenty of room for our things and good availability of plug ##s . My only complaint is the shower . The water pressure was ok , but could have been better , and it seemed a little under ##si ##zed for as luxurious a room as this was . The staff make the hotel very special . Everyone I saw had a smile and a kind word , and the ladies at breakfast ( Georgia and Ke ##ish ##a ) even helped me with my diet ##ary needs . People like them are what make a hotel special . I ' ll definitely stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie again the next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for my sisters birthday and it was amazing ! The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly . I would stay at this hotel again . We had a total of 3 rooms and the hotel went out of their way to make sure we were all next to each other . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 5 nights on a city break to Chicago . The location was ideal for us so I ’ m pleased we booked this as we nearly booked a hotel slightly further out of the city . The room was small . NYC small . But you ’ re in a city so it ’ s expected to a degree . The bathroom had a bath and a shower over it which is a bonus as sometimes it ’ s shower only and I am a bath person . However getting hot water was a challenge . We discovered if we let the water run for approx 10 min ##s we got hot water from the shower / bath however we didn ’ t achieve hot water from the sink . The hotel was clean , a little tired ( wall ##paper was p ##eel ##ing for example in room ) but the price we paid , the location and it was just a room with a bed for us it fitted our purpose . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sleep ##er sofa bed ' s were H ##OR ##RI ##BL ##E ! Staff was friendly , great breakfast food items . Use Spot Hero for parking , the lot is right across the street and was $ 25 . 00 per night ( no in and out ) but a huge savings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You won ' t believe what happened to us . We stayed 2 nights from 14th to 16th . We put a negative feedback the 18th for 2 main reasons : room was not ready at 2 ##pm and they check us at 4 ##pm only , second reason the luggage guy A ##rna ##ud told me " you don ' t give me any tips " like he was astonished ! ( He did not put the luggage inside the room , just brought the cart that ' s it ) . And coincidence , my credit card has been charged a second time the 19th of au ##gus ##t , just after my negative feedback ! Also read other reviews about te ##ir tactical to try to upgrade by pretending the room is not ready . S ##nea ##ky methods and weird behaviour for a 4 star hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hilton is in a great location on S Michigan Ave and is located in a historic building . What a grand entrance ! But then it does downhill from there . As you enter the reception desk ##s are tucked away down the hallway to the right , and since the hotel is so big , there may be long lines . So be prepared to wait . I will say that there are plenty of elevators to deal with the crowds . The walk to your room may also be quite the hike . Once we got there , we found our room to be of good size and nicely updated . Typical Hilton fare ( i . e . , quite good ) . So I think this is a good choice if you come for sights ##ee ##ing or if you attend a conference that happens to be hosted here . If you ' re here for shopping , you ' re probably better off staying a bit further north . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay at the Chicago O ##m ##ni every year for our anniversary . It ' s consistently one of the best experiences . Nice place , great location , all in all , awesome . The bar food was above and beyond awesome and great service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . No complaints , close to the red line , grocery store one block over , right in the heart of downtown , walking distance to just about everything . Great view from the rooftop pool . Would highly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed many times . Never fails to sur ##pass our expectations location to shopping and food ##ing can ' t be beat . The bar downstairs is worth a visit . walking distance to Golden Triangle and other exciting venues [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is located just off Michigan Ave ( north end ) . Great location for restaurants , shopping and walking ! The hotel is very nice ! Old school el ##egan ##ce in the modern era ! Room ##s are very comfortable . The bathroom ##s are very modern with outstanding rain shower ##s ! I recommend staying at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker when in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Yes the Hilton Chicago is old . Yes , it shows its age in many ways and the common areas are a little dated and in need of a re ##fu ##rb ##ishing . However , it is a great value hotel in an awesome location . The rooms are large with plenty of closet space and a spacious bathroom . The gym area is one of the best I ' ve ever seen at a hotel . The entrance and common areas are very ornate . All in all , a solid value hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed here many times on business . . . . I have never had a bad experience or a complaint . . . check in is always a breeze . . . they bend over backwards to accommodate your needs . . . w courtesy , efficiency and pro ##mpt ##ness . And the continental breakfast ( that is included in your room price ! ! ! ) is a god send on early morning business trips . . . And then the courtesy lounge at the end of the day is a great way to relax , have a little app ##eti ##zer and a drink . . . . all free with your stay ! Again , such a nice per ##k . I stay here every time I ' m in town . . . always consistent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for three days in September , and we were impressed . The staff was very friendly and helpful . We had a suite where the window si ##lls were padded for a reading no ##ok . Looking out over the Chicago River and Marina Towers was a joy . The restaurant downstairs was not bad for breakfast , and they provided wine for an hour or two in the afternoon ##s off the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I tried to spend two nights trying to sleep at this hotel September 9 & 10 . Both nights from around 2 : 30 am until 4 : 30 am I was awakened and kept awake by a pounding vibration - sounded / felt like a bass guitar - and occasional blast ##s of un ##int ##elli ##gible am ##plified voices . I am confident this came from a nearby nightclub , but it doesn ' t matter , I still was awakened and kept awake by this blast of noise . The good news is it did not go on until dawn , but I lost two hours of sleep each night . If you expect The Ki ##nz ##ie to offer you a good night ' s sleep , bring ear ##p ##lug ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in Chicago . Get Gold membership to enjoy the benefits . Good location . Only wish they had somewhere to sit in the front of hotel when you might be waiting for taxi or friends . Bar inside is good as well as the Columbus Ta ##p room for breakfast or lunch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone we encountered at the hotel was so friendly and helpful . The room was comfortable and clean . Some of the restaurants were closed because of Co ##vid pre ##ca ##ution ##s , but the Big Bar was open and the food and service were great . The quality of the food was on par with stand alone restaurants . The hotel was not yet offering daily house ##keeping due to the pan ##de ##mic , but provided anything we needed upon request . Location was convenient and minutes from museums , the Navy Pier , the River ##walk , and the L . High ##ly recommend , and will return on our next trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for an event . The hotel itself has an interesting architecture . The event part of the hotel isn ' t that great . A lot of rooms but barely a bigger area where one could place an exhibition for example . Generally clean . Nice staff at the front desk and bar . Help ##ful guidance around all kind of questions . Located near the beach area . Some attractions walk ##able . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Conrad for four nights : 8 / 19 th ##ru 8 / 22 . The biggest mistake I made was pre ##pa ##ying for the room because it would have been limited to one night . The rooms obviously have some type of sensors in them that are linked to the air conditioning system . Every night we were woken up because the A / C turned off and the room became extremely hot . To get the A / C to come back on , we had to get out of bed and move about the room . If you prefer your sleep to be disrupted by the lack of comfort in the room than this hotel is for you . It was un ##fa ##th ##oma ##ble to me that a so - called 5 star hotel would j ##eo ##pard ##ize the comfort of their guests to save a little in electricity costs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at H ##ya ##tt re ##gen ##cy Chicago for 3 nights . . hotel is good , rooms are ok . . food is above average . . . it is a typical H ##ya ##tt city hotel , however the only concern I had was with House ##keeping . I was a bit frustrated that HK did not clean the room for the first couple of days , more ##over when the cleaned it up in the last day there was a lot of dust everywhere in the room . . apart from that the stay was not so bad [SEP]
1	[CLS] We very much enjoyed our stay . We chose to upgrade to a suite on the 32nd floor after being offered an upgrade deal on arrival . The only problem was that we were switching from 2 queen beds to a king size and were told we could get 3 rolling beds for our kids . After we were settled in our room , we were told fire code only allowed one so my son had to sleep on a tiny love seat . Otherwise the space was perfect , quiet , always cleaned exceptionally well . The location was perfect ! We will definitely be staying there on our next Chicago trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As many below have noted , the Inter ##con is in a great location , and that makes a short stay all the more enjoyable . Our room had an excellent view of the river , and you can ' t beat having the Purple Pig across the street , particularly if is it rain ##ing . We will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable beds , staff was great , good location within walking distance to just about everything we needed to do and see . Easy to get to via train from the airport then a short walking distance . River walk right next to the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Thanks to the very court ##eous and respect ##ful staff and service , the beautiful , quiet accommodation ##s , and the full service restaurant , this was a great place to stay while in Chicago with family . We had dinner in the 67 ##6 Restaurant due to a long day and our meal was delicious and the service very nice . I had stayed at an O ##m ##ni hotel in NYC and was so impressed by the wonderful staff there that I chose O ##m ##ni in Chicago when I needed to book a hotel . I highly recommend this hotel . They understand excellent service and consideration of their guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Inter Continental is such a te ##rri ##fic historic hotel . Great location , great service , comfortable , te ##rri ##fic amenities . The staff is quite friendly and helpful . Breakfast was outstanding ( also great service ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 6 nights good location we were able to walk to everywhere we wanted to visit . Staff very efficient and pleasant throughout the hotel . Room and bathroom very modern and clean . Good value for money compared with budget hotels [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice location - close to the lake and the metro / bus . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . Friendly staff . I liked that they had the option of purchasing late night snack ##s . It was very quiet in the night , do had a great night sleep . Room had a nice view of the lake and the city . Bit expensive , ( e . g . a bottle of water in the room costs $ 6 ! ) but worth it for a special occasion . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very busy hotel - we had to wait 30 minutes to check - in . Big room , good location and excellent breakfast . Well equipped gym and pool a good size / length for distance swimming . Help ##ful con ##cier ##ge who gave very useful advice about transport to the airport . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is convenient ##ly located near Michigan Avenue and the rooms are wonderful . The rooms have electronic lighting controls and a very large TV . The rooftop was not open yet , but sounded like it would be a great place to visit this summer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Me and my fi ##an ##cé spent our thanks ##gi ##ving holiday at this hotel . I am surprised with the hospitality of all the staff . Guillermo , the restaurant manager did an excellent job . Very friendly and hard ##working . We will definitely stay at this hotel again . En ##joy ##ed the evening social , they have a great food selection to the point that we don ' t have to go out to grab dinner ! The room was spacious and it looks new ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my fifth trip to ch ##ica ##go since thanks ##gi ##ving and my third stay at the Conrad . Management has got it down pat at this new hotel . Many of the staff recognized me on this stay , which signals to me they have the right players on their team and they are well coached . Good work . I will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I enjoyed a quick weekend get ##away at the Ki ##nz ##ie . The location is hard to beat , within a block of the river in the heart of downtown . We were easily able to walk to Mill ##eni ##um Park and along the shores of Lake Michigan . We got back to the hotel in time for our compliment ##ary cocktail , and then walked a couple of blocks to a wonderful Italian restaurant . The staff was friendly , the room was comfortable , and we were very satisfied . My only complaint is that we were in room 313 , with the huge Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel sign right out our window , and looking across to a building . De ##fin ##ite ##ly not a great view . Still , no complaints . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A good and amazing place ! ! The Room ’ s are clean and everything ’ s are t ##idy . I loved it here ha ##ha because I remembered something special last year ! [UNK] I will always choose this place to stay during my travels . . . five stars for you [UNK] [SEP]

1	[CLS] I went to a convention and then spent one night in this lovely bout ##ique hotel . It has everything one could need and more . The lobby is intimate and welcoming . The furnishings are wonderful . Our bed was completely comfortable . It will be out go - to hotel when we want to stay overnight in Chicago . It ' s location is wonderful , as well , to all the key attractions in Chicago . Despite living a Chicago Sub ##ur ##b where I could go home to sleep . . . I will frequent this downtown hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a great hotel with great rooms . The staff is friendly and helpful . All resources are accounted for , and you are very close to everything downtown . It is worth the price in my opinion . Would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff and v ##alet were excellent and very professional . The rooms were very nice and clean . The walls must be thin because I heard dogs and children easily in other nearby rooms . However , their bar was excellent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently spent a long weekend in Chicago with my two daughters and we stayed at the So ##fit ##el , which proved to be a wonderful choice . The So ##fit ##el is a sophisticated , beautifully decorated , sub ##lim ##e hotel . Room ##s were clean , comfortable , and had ex ##pan ##sive views . The location is perfect : very near the lake and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and within walking distance of the river and many exceptional restaurants . We loved Chicago , the So ##fit ##el and had a truly memorable three days together . Couldn ' t have been nice ##r ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] This hotel was neat and t ##idy . A ##ble to walk to Grant Park and see a free concert . Walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago . Walking distance to Navy Pier and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It was a fantastic location and worthy of repeat stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Been there in 2011 , the view is just perfect as we were in 21st floor which was facing Lake Michigan . The hotel is in a good location close to Millennium Park and easy access to many places , com ##fy bed , clean room and great staff ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , good location , awesome rooms and wonderful meeting / functions space . I would recommend this hotel for any small , mid - size events . Lots of meeting / function room options . Most downtown locations are easily accessible . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful stay , beautiful hotel , loved the roof top bar and restaurant cannot beat the view of Chicago . Would recommend the Conrad for anyone visiting Chicago . Great location just down the street from Michigan Avenue [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was fairy small and they gave me a room for people with disabilities ( which was in ##con ##ven ##ient for me to use ) , not really sure how they came up with that ! ! I didn ##t have a refrigerator in my room so had to request one and they brought it in long past midnight ! The cleaning staff were really loud in the hallway ##s and once they even had a loud argument in the morning . Though after all this in ##con ##ven ##ience , Connie Alex was really sweet and friendly in the club lounge and made me wrap up my stay with a happy smile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lo ##aca ##tion is great but the rooms are small and cramped . Since I am a Gold member I requested an upgrade but rather than up ##grading , they put me in a corner room which was small , and cramped . Had to watch TV on from an angle . Overall , not a good experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago is one of the main hotels I book when traveling to Chicago . From getting out of the cab and checking into the hotel , to getting a bite to eat at the bar , to the check ##out and cab ride back , the team in Chicago is fantastic . The only thing I had to say was that there was a line in the registration which I am not used to but it still moved fairly quickly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always love returning to the H ##ya ##tt , staff the parking men and house ##keeping all very very nice , hey and don ' t forget to tip everyone they deserve it , and that means maid ##s and bell ##hop ##s , loved the coffee bar and what they had to offer [SEP]
1	[CLS] Need ##ed a good night ' s sleep after a big day in the Wind ##y City . We got it at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . The room was updated , bed comfortable , and bathroom clean . Price ##line provided a reasonable cost for what we were looking for . Would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My best friend was in town and we were celebrating her birthday . I booked on Price ##line and got a pretty good deal . We were given a one room suite , so the couch pulled out to a bed . For 2 of us we had a lot of room . The room was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful ( we called to have s ##cis ##sors delivered , for someone to help with the pull out bed and to borrow umbrella ##s due to the rain . ) Walking distance to the lake so that was fun and then we cab ##bed it to the river ##front . Overall we were really pleased with the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is huge and as such , you don ' t expect really good personal ##ized service but a mechanical , ins ##in ##cer ##e level of service from everywhere . The only staff that stood out were the Events managers , banquet , and A ##V people . The rooms are really good and bed were very comfortable . [SEP]

1	[CLS] This is a regular hotel for me for business travel , it ' s super com ##fy , rooms are spacious and the hotel has a friendly and modern v ##ibe - love the free morning coffee and free evening wine is an added bonus . And how can you fault a hotel that has the option of a gold ##fish in your room ? ! Great breakfast in the connected diner / restaurant too . [SEP]

1	[CLS] We stayed here with our two - year - old to celebrate my husband ‘ s 40th birthday and everything was superb from start to finish ! The room was ideal for our family and the service was exceptional . The extra touches that were done for my husband ‘ s 40th birthday as well as for my son was very impressive ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely loved this Hotel . So much history and staff were lovely . The location couldn ' t be any better , just off Michigan Avenue and so a 5 minute walk to all the shops and restaurants . I recommend the Hotel Tour , this is so interesting and adds to the appreciation of the Hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was attending a conference and I can ’ t stress enough how impressed I am with hotel ’ s design and r ##ustic charm . It was re ##f ##reshing to see the gym facilities that are imp ##ec ##ca ##bly clean , also benefit of having a sa ##una and a large indoor pool ( all included in my stay ) in downtown Chicago hotel are definitely a win . The absolute pin ##nacle of my stay were very pleasant host Ms . Din ##a , my server Agnes who anticipated all my needs and absolutely charming manager Bo who gave me some valuable insight on hotel ’ s history as well as few facts about the city of Chicago as itself . I will definitely try to visit again when I am on vacation … and hopefully when weather is a bit better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was here for a conference and love the property . Great location and beautiful . Close to mi ##chi ##gan avenue and clean and court ##eous all around . Would come here on leisure travel and would re ##c this to future bi ##z trips and personal . On site there are two patio restaurants that while we were here were not open as it is April and they are open in May , but the location would make those 2 spots awesome to go to ! Inside there is a breakfast / lunch pat ##tis ##ser ##ie which was good , a coffee shop which has to go sa ##mmy ##s and salad ##s , both good and then Shu ##la ' s for dinner and the Chi bar which is the lobby bar which has beautiful windows overlooking the river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Al ##bei ##t a short weekend stay , we were thoroughly impressed with The Talbot ##t . There was a slight g ##lit ##ch at check - in due to a 3rd party vendor we booked through ( should have known better ! ) but D ##wayne greeted us and helped my 4 year old & pregnant self find a comfortable seat until all was resolved . Front desk provided free drink v ##ou ##chers while we waited & our quick bite at 20 ##E was delicious ! Our room was clean , cold during the 90 + degree weather & everyone we encountered was wonderful . Thank you for employing such friendly staff & make sure D ##wayne is your face of the hotel . . . . . what a great impression he left ! ! Will be back during our next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel in the heart of the Gold Coast . The hotel knew we were celebrating a birthday . They upgraded our room and provided us with beverage coup ##ons for the bar . They also sent up a bottle of champagne with flute ##s to our room . Great service and friendly people . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Palmer House for a 4 day weekend with my two teenage daughters . I had stayed at the hotel many times for business over the decades . The look on my daughter ' s face as we went up the es ##cal ##ator to the lobby was price ##less . They were in awe and I was in heaven to see this great beginning to our Father / Daughter trip to town to see Hamilton . The hotel upgraded us to a double sized room and the con ##cier ##ge was brilliant in all his recommendations for br ##unch and shopping - two important things when traveling with teenager girls . Great great hotel choice for our weekend . The girls didn ' t even care that the pool was closed for repairs in the end . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency was the host hotel for the conference . It ’ s an A + place to stay . The conference layout was a bit trick ##y because of the two towers . It was easy to get turned around when trying to find a meeting room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently went here for a conference and was very pleased with the hotel , the room and all amenities ! Nice bed , bath ##tub , and t ##v ! The staff were pleasant and very helpful . Great access to the city and local food ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Staff was great ! You are greeted with smiles at the door . Very helpful . Check ##ing experience good . Everyone is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Hotel rooms are all newly re ##mo ##del ##ed and look amazing . The breakfast and dinner ##s are the best around . [SEP]

1	[CLS] This beautiful hotel is central ##ly located , and I was there for a conference . What really impressed me with the staff - despite having checked in , my key was unable to open the hotel room door . Two housekeeper ##s on the 16th floor saw me , and Sandra , the housekeeper went out of her way to call Security to let me in to the room - rather than have to go all the way downstairs with my bags and get a new key . Jim , the Director of Security couldn ' t have been nice ##r - he checked my ID with a call to the Front Des ##k and let me in . Another housekeeper on the floor , a beautiful lady with silver hair , was extremely pleasant each morning and night . They all made my stay that much better , and I appreciate all they did to go out of their way to assist me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is doing good in various aspect . Good location near magnificent mile Close to bus and metro station Overall speaking it ’ s clean and t ##idy O ##cca ##sional voice from ambulance outside . Only draw ##back is they just provide continental breakfast but not a b ##uff ##et breakfast . The hotel is simple without fancy design . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Work ##ed a booth the Star Wars Celebration and booked this hotel through the event center . We were very pleased with the hotel and the price . The staff was wonderful , it was very quiet , there was a market just around the corner . We would absolutely stay there again if we are working an event at the McCormick Center . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was spacious , clean , comfortable , but most of all the staff was amazing . We were given great tips on where to eat and fun things to do . . Charles , David , and Than were top notch with customer service . We will definitely stay again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Although the hotel was beautiful and in an incredibly accessible location of Chicago , we experienced an issue at check in that set the tone for our stay . When we arrived , we were told that the hotel was experiencing an issue and that we would have to stay at a different hotel down the road for the night and check into our original hotel the next day . The Talbot ##t did give us an upgraded room and were able to check us in right away the next day ( although a day later than booked ) , but the n ##ui ##sance of having to walk to a different hotel , check in there , check out the next morning , and re - check into the Talbot ##t did not seem properly acknowledged by the Talbot ##t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very helpful and friendly . The hotel was modern and super clean . Breakfast was good and different every day . Social hour was great . The roof top indoor pool was nice and warm . Would come back next week if I could ! ! ! Location was great walking distance to everything you might want to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bar staff was great at the P ##ump Room . Library staff , dreadful . Des ##k not very helpful . No one even asked to help with my bags . The experience wasn ' t completely bad but would have been better if staff was more a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Room ##s were ok , device plug ##s didn ' t work and no USB slots . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would highly recommend this hotel . From check in to check out , the staff was exceptional and the room exceeded expectations . My 2 adult daughters and I shared our huge room as we were celebrating a 30th B ##day . The oversized bathroom with 2 sinks was definitely a plus [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was recently here on business . They were extremely busy and my room wasn ’ t ready . The nice young lady at the desk made a quick call and I was upgrade to a suite . That was service . They are in a good location . Within walking distance of several excellent restaurants and shopping . The river walk is across the street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was beautiful , could have maybe had a little better collection of store within the hotel . gifts etc . maybe a book on the hotel since it was an older one . Coffee maker in the room or a place for compliment ##ary coffee . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our bed was very comfortable and we slept well . The water was nice and hot . The entrance is lovely and the architecture impressive . The view was awesome of the water . You will have to ask for this . The hotel is a bit worn and a ta ##d s ##tin ##ky but it ’ s not bad and probably a good value . I enjoyed the j ##ac ##uz ##zi . It was clean and the perfect temperature . It was nice to be able to pick up a healthy salad in their little shop . One note : my booking went hay ##wire . I booked a king suite but wound up with a double bed . I never in a million years would book a double . Somehow I booked through an East Indian booking company called Can ##cel ##O ##n . Be careful . I don ’ t think this is the hotels fault however . Still b ##af ##fled by this . Review and K ##EE ##P all your booking re ##ceipt ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve spent one night on a business trip . I arrived late at night , and the reception personnel was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . The room was upgraded to a beautiful room . I will return , a great location and view . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had an extremely nice stay at he O ##m ##ni hotel . The service and clean ##liness was great , the only de ##tract ##or was that the Air - conditioning was a bit loud when going to sleep . However it would definitely not keep me from booking again . Fantastic amount of room and the gym was great too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nicely updated hotel in north river ##front area , walking distance to Michigan Ave . Small ##ish lobby and I didn ' t notice a restaurant , although we were out most of the time . The room was comfortable and bathroom was re ##mo ##del ##ed , although the left the dual Speak ##man shower heads . Haven ' t seen those in a while . They set up breakfast in the lobby of every floor across from the elevators . There was a nice selection of past ##ries , yo ##gu ##rt , cereal and some fresh fruit . Be aware that they do have a resort fee , however , I found a great rate even with the resort fee added . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very helpful staff during a pleasant stay . Suite ##s were spacious and comfortable . Location , just off Michigan Ave . cannot be beat . In general , O ##m ##ni Hotels are first class . Did not get a chance to check out the hotel bar or food , but it looked attractive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My time at this hotel was magnificent ! I spent my time celebrating with friends . The location was great . Close to great dining and entertainment . The room was beautiful . The bed was comfortable . The staff was pleasant and took care of all my needs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great time celebrating my wife ' s birthday . Hotel upgraded us to a suite , and also put a birthday " surprise " in the room for my wife ( cup ##cake , sparkling water ) . Staff was excellent and caring , and the facility is unique and beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I spent 4 nights at the Ki ##nz ##ie and were thoroughly impressed . The location is great , the prices reasonable and the staff was outstanding . Gerry and S ##pen ##ser were quite at ##ten ##tive and helpful . Happy hour drinks and a b ##uff ##et breakfast were included . Both were great - - - much better than average . The breakfast b ##uff ##et was set up on each floor by the elevator landing and was quite convenient . The coffee was really good which is important to me and I was quite happy with the food . The Ki ##nz ##ie was re ##mo ##del ##ed three years ago and still looked brand - new . My wife and I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an excellent time . The location of the hotel was perfect . We used the gym , got massage ##s and ate at the hotel and everything was amazing . The staff was court ##eous and re ##sp ##ons ##ive when we needed them to be and gave us our privacy when we asked for it . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed staying at the She ##rato ##n on business . It was an easy walk to the Ma ##g mile and other things . I had a beautiful view from the river ! The lobby was pretty dead with the main bar closed , but overall a good stay . I ' ll see myself back here next year I think ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First of all , I loved the location . There are plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood to choose from , including Eat ##aly , which is just around the corner . For those who want to use the en suite mini kitchen , Whole Foods is two blocks away . The room felt a bit out ##dated but has a great layout and everything you need for a comfortable stay . Hotel lobby , located on the sixth floor is nice and spacious . Hotel front desk service was superb . OR ##D airport is about 45 min drive away , and I paid about $ 32 for a L ##y ##ft ride . I would certainly come back to Home ##wood Suite ##s on my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at this hotel for the service we received and value for our money . Location is excellent - all major attractions at a walking distance . Restaurant and the Market place was really great added feature . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a room overlooking the street and it was so lovely . It had a little al ##co ##ve with a twin size mattress and you could read or watch TV feeling like you were out over the street . The room was a nice size , bed very comfortable , nice bathroom and g ##rac ##ious staff . I would definitely stay here again in fact , did try to the next week , but it was fully booked . Location is great for walking the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Really old mattress ##es that suck to sleep on . I would avoid this hotel simply for this reason . The hotel service was spot on and great , but couldn ' t really make up for a poor night ' s sleep . The walls were pretty thin and the hotel loud at times . The de ##cor was pretty tired and out ##dated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Year after year this hotel and staff is one of the best in Chicago . Great location for shopping , and great restaurant selection . Radio and Pius will greet you and are always a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Guest reception is another plus . G ##rab a beverage a ##bs a snack before going out on the town . Don ' t miss this one ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was f ##abulous . I had my bachelor ##ette party at Ki ##nz ##ie , the room was beautiful and the view was great ! We had a personal ##ized hand written card from staff welcoming us with a bottle of champagne . So special . The rooms were clean and smell ##d great . We headed to the bar on the 6th floor which was fun , good app ##iti ##zers ! Then went to private room for a painting party for 16 people . We had a blast and every staff member was helpful , kind , and welcoming . Will def ##inate ##ly have to stay again . I would recommend this hotel to everyone . Dean ##na was so helpful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location - we walked everywhere we wanted to go . The only negative - we arrived very early ( 7 : 30 ##ish ) so of course we had no room . Which was fine but when you ’ re told they ’ ll “ priority ” clean your room and text you when it ’ s ready and it ’ s 3 pm - regular check in - not so priority . I wasn ’ t expecting a room at 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 or even 1 but just say we can hold your bags and if something comes up we ’ ll let you know . It obviously didn ’ t ruin our trip and we ’ d stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Part ##ici ##pate ##d in a conference this past weekend and overall it was fine . The staff are very welcoming and work hard . The Cha ##gall conference room has windows and it is a great set up . Not a dark room but floor to ceiling windows . The Van Go ##gh room was small , with pillars and not great for a lunch time speaker . They were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting with modifications to the menu ##s to make it ve ##get ##arian friendly and less heavy . Room ##s seem a little tired but were clean and house ##keeping was friendly . Cold - and the extra blanket was not too much help . Warm ##er blankets would have been a plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is my second home . The best food and service at Lock ##wood . Top management team as well . I visit at least twice a week . From the door and bell staff until I stuff myself with chef Jason ' s creations and drown myself at the bar this is the place to be . Marty the bar mix ##ologist is number one . Try room 23 - 120 . Wet bar and a great view . Top security team and Ken Price can give you the history of the hotel . I am Kevin Major ##s and you can e mail me and I will reply . Kevin ##ma ##jo ##rs @ ya ##ho ##o . com [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly luxury hotel . Had a big 2 double bed room , bathroom well away from the beds with a huge walk in shower and separate toilet . Spa ##cious dressing area with wardrobe ##s . F ##av ##our ##ite feature was the electronic blind ##s and curtains you can control from the bed ! In a great area of Chicago , you can walk out of the hotel and you ' re in the mix of it all . V ##isi ##ted the bar which had a nice am ##bie ##nce . Really friendly , helpful staff on the downstairs front desk and he upstairs reception ( wish I could remember names ! ) High ##ly highly recommended , cannot wait to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed on a Friday night as we were attending a charity event in the downtown area . Un ##ex ##pect ##edly upgraded to a room with a view of the Chicago River . Nice window seat that made it easy to kick back and enjoy the view . The staff was super friendly and the rooms were well - appointed . There was a wine - tasting for guests that night at 6 pm in the lobby and we stopped by before leaving for the charity event . The other guests were shocked to see three couples in t ##uxe ##dos and evening gown ##s at the wine tasting – we joked that we had been told there was a dress code ! The location is in the ” loop ” or the heart of downtown Chicago – easy walking distance to shopping , restaurants , museums and parks . An all - around superb stay – highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I were at Swiss ##ote ##l on the same weekend as Chicago marathon . Even with the crowd , service and friend ##liness were top shelf , with both the Con ##cier ##ge staff and lobby bar staff earning special praise . I like visiting Chicago , but it was even better because of Swiss ##ote ##l staff . The room , the people , and the mood all were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was very modern and right on the water with amazing views of the lake . The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable . You couldn ' t ask for a better location which was right on the edge of the park and the start of the Miracle Mile . The only negative was all the construction going on at the time around the hotel ; however , it was a minor in ##con ##ven ##ience [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Bed ##s are very comfortable . Had a junior suite - - small area with a couch and chair ; half a wall separated the bedroom from the " living room . " If you can get a deal - - go for it ! Bart ##ender ##s are friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed the restaurants as well as the convenience of being able to access the stores and restaurants through the P ##ed ##W ##ay attached to the hotel . You don ' t even have to go outside . The bed ##ding is all feathers but since I ' m all ##ergic the staff quickly changed them out . The bell man quickly jumped in and helped me by putting my luggage in the bay of the bus ( going to the convention ) in the rain with out me even asking . The walls were a little then . You can hear when the person next door gets up to use the rest ##room in the middle of the night or when their alarm goes off et . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##hare ##d the room with one person and it was plenty of room , co ##zy lighting , nice heated bathroom floor , great water pressure in the shower . The bed was really comfortable and overall I had a great trip . D ##wayne was especially nice - go to him for great service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location was very convenient and close to magnificent mile and shops at Nord ##strom . Really easy for u ##ber / l ##y ##ft pickup . Friendly hotel staff , clean rooms , good compliment ##ary breakfast and decent evening social / dinner which I honestly was not aware of so it came as a welcomed surprise for me . Suite ##s are very co ##sy and private . Very ideal for a business stay . S ##light ##ly price ##y but so is everything around that area , so it ' s competitive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location within walking distance of restaurants , shopping and Lake Michigan . Staff is at ##ten ##tive and very helpful . Room ##s are small , but clean and bed is com ##fy . Limited window views so rooms can feel smaller than they really are . El ##eva ##tors are slow , so don ’ t be in a hurry . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Conrad over Memorial Day weekend and thought it was a great hotel in a very convenient location for shopping / dining on Michigan Ave which is all we were there to do . Staff is great . Hotel is not even a year old so very new , clean rooms with up to date amenities . Big TV ' s . The rooftop bar and indoor bar are both very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location right along the River . Good proximity to Michigan Ave . Average accommodation ##s . Below average breakfast b ##uff ##et which was ho ##rri ##bly over ##p ##rice ##d . Clean room , good fitness center but just an average stay overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , great amenities , great location , great food ( I wish there were more options for healthy eat ##ers , like a juice ##r where you can make your own juice . I see this at many Hilton hotels worldwide ) , comfortable beds , good bedrooms . Logistics need improvement . I needed the re ##ceipt of my payment at the moment of check ##out since I travel for Business . The lady at the reception said their system was down so she couldn ' t give it to me but she would email it . I gave her my email but I never received anything . Now I need to contact them again ( I am back in Europe ) . Otherwise a very nice hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Ki ##nz ##ie on a business trip . Not your typical hotel a bit eclectic . . . from the check in ex ##per ##ie ##ce sitting at a desk , to the happy hour on the 6th floor , it was a nice stay . Clean rooms with plenty of space . Each floor had continental style breakfast centralized by the elevators which was nice to not wait in line or worry about a crowd . . . just grab some food and head back to your room . Good location to several popular rest ##ura ##nts like Harry Cara ##y ' s , Public House and Rock Bottom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was very clean and has a lot of character . Location is great . Am ##eni ##ties are great for the cost . My room was near the train which I could hear as I fell asleep , but it didn ' t bother me . Very comfortable , and friendly staff . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been to the Am ##bas ##s ##dor multiple times ! The bartender ##s at Booth One are friendly and provide great customer service . Cha ##ris ##se was my waitress and was great ! The food was amazing ( lo ##bs ##ter toast ) and the manager , Nate , came over and made sure everything was to our liking and even engaged with us which was a nice per ##k . The rooms are beautiful and guest services , believe his name is Travis was at ##ten ##tive and planned great weekend activities ! . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Location in the very Center of the City , all major attractions are in walking distance ( Navy Pier , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , 360 O ##bs ##er ##vation ) , the Big ##B ##us has a stop just in front of the Hotel . We spent a week there and were really happy with all . Special ##ly John the Door ##man who was the only one who always carried a smile and was greeting no matter how many times that day you passed him already , great guy . Con ##cier ##ge as also the waitress ##es at the bar were awesome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m definitely coming back . . . In and out parking garage with stay for 50 dollars next to building restaurant for room service near by they are making the best out of there co ##vid situation . I highly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel fulfill ##s everything I expect in a Kim ##pton : friendly staff , exceptional restaurant , funk ##y v ##ibe ; but what makes this is L ##OC ##AT ##ION ! Easy walking distance to the Art Institute and Millennium Park . I wanted to take the South Shore Line to Indiana Du ##nes National Lakes ##hore , and it was a two block walk to the station . Lots of f ##abulous eating options around . High ##ly recommended , especially for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in perfect location . Easy access to Michigan Ave in both directions and near north . Staff was on top of everything and made stay super pleasant Regency lounge in particular was excellent . This hotel is an example of why H ##ya ##tt is our # 1 choice in our travels [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean ##ing service didn ' t rest ##ock wine glasses , wash clothes , shape , or hand towels . For a 4 star rated hotel I felt like I was staying at a discount chain . We did not spend a lot of time at the hotel but the time we did was disappointing . To come back with a bottle of wine and find that the dirt ##ies were removed but not replaced is annoying . To return for a shower after a long day sight seeing and have to wait for wash clothes and s ##ham ##po ##o , also disappointing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hilton was the worst hotel we have ever stayed at in the Hilton line . The one day we were able to get breakfast it was great . Next day we went down for breakfast we could not even get service after we waited 20 minutes and we have the waitress a $ 10 tip day before . At night bar closes at 10 whether they have patrons or not . Hotel room and outside lobby always smelled like marijuana . Na ##use ##ous . You have to ask for clean towels and take it your own trash . This may be due to CO ##VI ##D . Front desk manager Denise was exceptional . Armand ##o was nice at bar also . The elevators had issues 2 days of our stay . One didn ' t work at all the other s ##poradic ##ally . Will stay somewhere else next time [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here as part of a tour group for 5 days . The location is excellent , on the magnificent mile and close to the lake with the great lakes ##ide walking and riding paths . Pit ##y about the lack of restaurant for evening meals , but the bar does cater for snack ##s and app ##eti ##ser ##s which are a decent size and more than adequate for a night time meal . Breakfast was B ##uff ##ett and the wait staff couldn ' t have been more helpful . The beds were very comfortable and amenities typical of USA hotels . Great customer service from the con ##cier ##ge desk , thanks Ta ##ria . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service at this hotel is outstanding . We got a Group ##on deal for our stay so it was also very affordable for a city hotel . The hotel lobby is well designed and a great place to grab a drink and people watch . The only issue was the rooms , though spacious , they had very dirty floors and some things were falling apart . The soap ##s are lovely and bathroom ##s are huge . Finally can ' t beat the location on the Gold Coast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The combination of extreme value , excellent service , and well - located bout ##ique hotel make for a great stay . You will not find a better value for such a comfortable visit . Kim ##pton is a great hotel chain , offering so much How can you compete with a pet friendly , free happy hour in intimate lobby with w ##i - fi when you register ? The stay was a blast ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel for our Chicago vacation . Both Bell ##men we had were wonderful . Our room was wonderful , very comfortable and clean . Lauren at the front desk made my kids day with her kindness . My only complaint was that we had a view of the parking lot and would have loved a better view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I were in Chicago for a quick three day trip . We decided to stay at the millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Chicago . This is a great hotel with a great location and a half block from the miracle mile . Quick 10 minute walk to rush street with many of the great restaurants are . We would recommend to anyone the hop on hop off bus tour as it gives you a great view and the ratio ##n of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location , took advantage of a beautiful summer evening and did the river walk after dinner on the near north side . At ##ten ##tive service , nice rooms and bathroom . Funk ##y designer bath ##robe ##s a nice touch . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the first steps into the wonderful ##ly perfume ##d lobby , to the welcoming staff , to the wonderful ##ly clean and well - kept rooms , there is nothing out of place here . So elegant . And , to top it off ? When my four - legged friend a ##cco ##mp ##ani ##es me , he has the option for a special meal from room service with a special bowl of " room temperature mineral water . " Who could ask for more ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been to two other Fair ##mont hotels and was a bit disappointed in this one . Line ##n was old , the rooms are a bit dated . The breakfast was awesome and the staff working there very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was meeting my brother and his wife in Chicago . It was our first time in the wind ##y city . I booked the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago as it was central to everything that we wanted to see . Hotel is beautiful . The reception ##ist was friendly and helpful and gave us a room on the 21st floor . The views were spectacular of the river and the city . Room was spot ##less and the bathroom was bigger than I expected , which was a nice touch . El ##eva ##tors were fast and staff were friendly . We stayed in the east wing . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a pleasure to work with someone like Crystal Math ##is in the Group Sales Department . She was extremely helpful after I had a major issue with booking rooms through our conference portal . As a Mar ##riot ##t / She ##rato ##n Platinum Elite member it is so nice to know that our patronage and loyalty is recognized during difficult situations and employees are em ##powered to show real customer service . Thank you Crystal ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent experience with all staff we were involved with . I am in love with the All ##egro ! Had not been a fan of Art Dec ##o until my visit at the All ##egro . Beautiful everywhere I went ! The bed was very comfortable , clean room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for this hotel . Walking distance to many downtown sites . Too expensive for what it offers . The clean ##ness of the room was unacceptable . You can hear the noise from the street at night making it difficult to sleep . You have to pay for Internet per day ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Staff were all very friendly ! The market had great sandwiches , they were available at all times of the day ! The Big Bar was great , awesome atmosphere ! ! Dr ##ink ##s were well poured and the pre ##tz ##el sticks were outstanding , we had them 3 times during our weekend visit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed with my boyfriend January 29th , 30th , and 31st . It is in a great location right downtown , in easy walking distance to millennium park , the bean ( of course ) , and some really great restaurants . The king bed was quite comfortable , they didn ##t have a coffee maker in the room or a free morning breakfast , though they had free coffee , and water downstairs . They do have a complementary wine hour from 5 - 6 ##pm . Which is nice , and they are pet friendly . I would stay here again and it was a nice trip . This location and staff only made my trip better . F ##Y ##I the w ##if ##i didn ##t work on my i ##phone but it did on my and ##roid tablet . . . . which was weird . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we were greeted by Ni ##no at Fair ##mont hotel in Chicago , to our room , to the champagne and chocolate covered straw ##berries . . . everything has been amazing . Special thanks to Gail the con ##cier ##ge who helped us with different recommendations on food and entertainment in Chicago . Everything and everyone was wonderful ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This property is very central ##ly located and extremely convenient if you have meetings downtown . Great service and friendly staff and I would recommend anyone that is visiting Chicago for business to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was excellent , easily walk ##able ( weather pending ) to anything you may need ( sights , metro , restaurants , stores ) . First impression is one of a very q ##ua ##int but grand hotel . Staff at the front desk were very interactive and conversation ##al - they seemed to take a real interest in my trip . El ##eva ##tors were really slow both ways ( I was on the 16th floor ) . The room is smaller than I expected , but most rooms in city centers are . Bed ##ding was comfortable and the room did have everything you need . . minus coffee . They do a happy hour in the lobby which I was not able to part ##ake in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was great . Right in the middle of where you want to be at great price . Didn ' t love the room we were assigned , and without much ad ##o , we were given a wonderful suite , same price . Staff was welcoming from the outs ##et . The door ##man D ##wayne is the best , always smiling and interesting to talk with . The front desk staff Mir ##sad ##a and In ##dre addressed all of our concerns with a smile . We only ate breakfast at the restaurant , food was del ##ico ##us and it was always a great way to start our day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location very near everything , a block from the river canal Room was clean and con ##fort ##able beds . Also y ##um ##my cookies and hot drinks in front desk . We enjoyed a lot and plan to come back some day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place for a couple of days for a visit . Clean rooms , quiet atmosphere , and friendly staff . Front door ##men made the experience for the hotel since they are on the front line and can help you with anything you my need or with any place you may need to go . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel , the location is fantastic and everything downtown is within walking distance . Only issue we had was the bed being much in need of an update which management said they were aware of . Other then that I would highly recommend this hotel for a great time in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Hotel and Location . Good staff . Quiet . Clean . Fe ##lt safe . Excellent city view . Reason ##able check out . Fun v ##ibe . Really friendly people . Everyone was helping each other out and felt welcomed . High ##ly suggest . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions were updated , clean , well decorated . El ##eva ##tors were fast . All employees were friendly and helpful . Restaurant was outstanding . Will definitely return and would recommend to anyone looking for a great Chicago experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here while attending Star Wars Celebration and enjoyed the hotel and it ' s a fantastic location . It ' s a short walk to a variety of great dining options . We had our pick of great pizza places ! We also enjoyed the nearby shopping . The staff is friendly and helpful . Vincent from bell services is especially great - - very friendly and he went above and beyond to help us ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Annual visit to Chicago and it never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . Stay ##ed at the Intercontinental and what a wonderful stay it was . This hotel never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . The rooms are spacious and the beds are exceeding ##ly comfortable , I cannot fault anything . The hotel staff are superb , I visit Chicago at least once a year and always stay at the Intercontinental . The staff remember you and go above and beyond . The location is perfect . A huge thank you to Will , Vince and all the other staff I met with whose names I cannot remember . Intercontinental you rock . Wonderful , wonderful stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The lobby was stunning ! Found the hotel room small and could feel that it is pretty old . Though renovated well , the size just doesn ’ t do justice . The staff was court ##eous . I liked the ve ##g b ##urger I ordered from in - room dining . [SEP]
0	[CLS] There is something about older yet distinguished hotels at any time of year and particularly during the holidays . A recent visit to the Palmer House did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint , providing romantic and el ##o ##quent visual aura of holiday trim ##ming ##s and grand ##eur . This was one of those affordable " nights out " with someone special . The fitness center was comprehensive and included in the normal room charge . The only surprise was no coffee maker in the room we stayed in , but otherwise , a wonderful weekend escape . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago is tucked away , but don ' t miss it ! Con ##ven ##ient , lovely , and friendly ! A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions were convenient , staff was friendly and helpful , and there was an air of excitement and belonging - - truly a great representation of Midwest hospitality and big - city v ##ibe ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first time in Chicago with my 7 year old granddaughter . The hotel was easy walking distance to the American Girl Place ( . 4 mi . ) and other sites we wanted to see . Help ##ful staff and we stayed in a suite that was perfect for my daughter , granddaughter , and myself [SEP]
1	[CLS] The v ##alet and bell ##men are outstanding here ! The bartender ##s are experienced , engaging and professional . Michelle is top notch ! ! The room was spacious and comfortable . We called for room service and the woman who took our order and followed up to make sure we were satisfied had a great personality and was thorough on her explanations and delivery . Any food and drink we had on - site was worth the money and the location of the hotel could not have been better for our purposes . A huge k ##udo ##s to your property and staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here for the F ##ab ##tec convention . Hotel was in a great location . Park ##ing was v ##alet and was outrage ##ous at $ 72 a day . Our room was in the executive tower which is not the new tower so our room was on the old side . It was clean and could see the water . Bed was comfortable . Only complaint was the sink had no where to put all my stuff . I would stay here again but would ask for the new tower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room on the 26th floor had an excellent view and offered both bath ##tub ##e and shower . Unfortunately I had to pay extra for breakfast and the hotel bar was closed very early - which account for the quiet part . Last , but not least I was not particularly happy with the location of the elevators . Far away from the lobby , hidden behind the wall didn ' t make me feel safe especially upon evening return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the O ##m ##ni in Chicago for a three day business trip . The hotel was in a great location on Michigan Avenue . The service and food were excellent . Room ##s were very nicely decorated , were spacious , and had nice sitting areas and baths . All of the staff were extremely helpful and nice . I would highly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been to this hotel about 5 times past year , each time I was impressed with the friend ##liness of the staff and each room I got was comfortable and clean , my favorite were the corner rooms facing away from the Ki ##nz ##ie street , Ki ##nz ##ie can be , especially on weekends or holidays pretty he ##ctic till late but being on upper floor does help . . I like the simple breakfast they serve in the main foyer by the elevator , have not tried the bar but every time i pass by it , seemed very co ##zy . . Location is great , easy access to many restaurants , easy walk to shopping and even late a night , felt safe to walk around . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Fun little hotel with nice features . My stay was for the weekend and it suited us perfectly . The window overlooking the city was my favorite part , sitting with my champagne in hand and watching my favorite busy city . Staff was wonderful and I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My boyfriend and I spent a night in the city . This is a very class ##y hotel . The staff is friendly . We had a great view of the Chicago River from our window . It is close to a lot of stuff downtown . You could easily walk anywhere downtown from this hotel . This hotel is very quiet . We never heard doors slam or people yelling or talking like you can in other hotels . The bathroom was actually a really nice size . It is bigger than what you usually get , which was nice . We loved out stay in this hotel ! We would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a must see attraction . It has the giant bean and other amenities which will keep you entertained for a while . After the Chicago River walk I ' d recommend this park as the second must see attraction . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time staying at a Swiss ##ote ##l . It will be my last . House ##keeping was awful - took away all used towels , and never replaced with new ones , I had to call for new towels . There was one day when house ##keeping did not come in to do their job till late afternoon . The house ##keeping manager needs to be fired for allowing service quality to drop to such low standards . Hair ##dr ##yer did not work . No tea sa ##chet ##s available for tea drink ##ers . Front desk staff were rude and di ##s ##res ##pect ##ful . Meeting space in lobby is very small . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was in Chicago for business but decided to stay a few extra days and make the trip both business and pleasure . I am a bit particular ; to my wife ' s s ##ha ##g ##rin . From arrival to departure the staff could not have been more professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They went out of their way in a sincere fashion to make our visit enjoyable . Door ##man , front ##des ##k , bartender at lobby bar to waiter . All made our trip memorable . We have been to other Kim ##pton properties and always appreciate the treatment they extend to their guests . Thanks , Jack and Te ##ri [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago at the end of November 2018 and it was a great experience . The rooms were nice , hotel staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the on ##site restaurant / food options were great . During our stay the bartender at Am ##use , Eddie , did an excellent job and provided great service . He remembered our drink orders and was always readily available to take care of us . Very persona ##ble and a great conversation ##alis ##t to all guests , not just us . Great hospitality ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love this hotel and stay here every time we come . The service is fantastic . We come every year for my daughters birthday and they always go out of their way to make it special . Her favorite person is the door ##man / v ##alet with the curly must ##ache ( I ' m blank ##ing on his name right now ) . They became instant friends . The rooms have so much more space than what you get in most city hotels . We love having a separate sleep area . And you cannot beat the location ! Right on Michigan Ave where all the excitement is ! Can ' t wait to go back next year ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed the stay here , the place is very clean and also safe , I really liked that you can access the rooms with room key only . I enjoyed the restaurant , also the proximity to shops along Michigan avenue , magnificent mile . The rooms are also very clean and quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was great , the staff was friendly and helpful . I recommend that everyone book this hotel . The parking is lo ##vated under the hotel and it is very convenient . Also the rooms have great views and the customers service is top notch . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It ' s my third trip to Chicago and I was looking for a hotel that was close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile but also a bit more hidden . So ##fit ##el Hotel was a great choice . The French v ##ibe was great and I enjoyed my hotel room and the wonderful breakfast each morning . The staff was friendly and helpful . I will come back to it the next time I ' m in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here as a family in a one bed suite which was perfect for our requirements . The hotel is in a good location a short walk or taxi ride from down town Chicago , it offers excellent value and good facilities with polite informed staff . We stayed for 5 nights and the suite was perfect offering spacious accommodation for two adults and two children ( aged 9 & 7 ) . The staff were always and the door ##men were particularly friendly to the family . Would not hesitate to book again if we return to your f ##abulous city ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This historic , iconic Chicago hotel remains stunning ##ly beautiful , with its unique charm kept intact . Love all the photos of the stars who played the Empire Room ad ##orn ##ing the hallway ##s . Hotel staff makes you feel special . The location is great and it ' s very affordable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is in a great location , we had a nice view of the river , staff were all very nice . Food was good . There is a " quick " market in the lobby that always too WA ##Y more time than it should have , so would recommend doing a small run at Trade ##r Joe ' s or something and bringing in food . Lines in the AM just to get a cup of coffee and bag ##el ran about 20 minutes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came up to Chicago to take our kids to their first Cubs game . We usually stay at the Thompson hotel down the street and really love this area of the city . The Talbot ##t is a sister hotel of the Thompson and the service and staff , like the Thompson , did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Everyone was kind , welcoming , and had great energy . The lobby and adjoining restaurant are beautiful and our room was large and fit our family well . We will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What can I say from v ##alet parking to check out , the staff were amazing . American , handle us with care and treat us like family . Michael ensured that our stay and visit was well worth the business h ##ust ##le all week . Thank you all for a great stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly room , we had the standard King . Based on previous reviews , we requested a room high up to avoid street noise and we were easily accommodate ##d . The bathroom had been re ##nn ##ova ##ted recently which was nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our 3rd stay at the Palmer House and we will never stay anywhere else . The beautiful lobby has us hooked , and the location is perfect ! Close to great restaurants , Hamilton playing just up the street , and the Chicago Theatre is also within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bed ##s were not very comfortable , but rooms were clean , and double bathroom ##s came in handy . Pool was great , and con ##cier ##ge was very helpful . Park ##ing was price ##y , but its Chicago , and it was a secured garage on site . Location was f ##abulous , had views of the Lake . Quiet floor , stay on upper floor , and avoid 8th floor , where pool and fitness center are . Never had to wait for an elevator , and always greeted by a friendly smile . Still definitely stay again ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] A great luxury hotel right downtown by the river . Some great views here and well worth the price . The rooms are really nice and new , Be ##ware the v ##alet parking is most expensive I ' ve ever experienced at $ 70 a night . Great rooms and fantastic service . Good food too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this hotel as it was a cheap deal wouldn ' t pay the usual price . When booking were told it had w ##if ##i but that ' s only in the lobby and needed it for booking ##s and work so had to pay $ 11 to use it . Sen ##t them an email and have heard nothing . Staff at check in were rude . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The week before I stayed at the Four Seasons just down the road ; it was rub ##bish and far more expensive . I would choose the Talbot ##t every time . The Talbot ##t is a good hotel , with warmth and excellent staff . My room was big , but without charm and I had a view of a brick wall . Great toilet ##ries though and very clean . Maid service was excellent . Bar and restaurant very nice . What was annoying was that only one lift was working and from the reviews on here it has been that way for months . I was on the third floor and at the suggestion of the staff used the stairwell , but that was g ##rot ##ty and should not be used for the public . I can understand the frustration of people on higher floors . Overall though a good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , y ##um ##my restaurant and very comfortable rooms . And the staff is outstanding , especially the door ##men , D ##wayne and Dave . Great value and an excellent choice ; this will be my new “ go to ” hotel in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is such an old world experience . The rooms are more than adequate in size . I do have to say the one of the best things about the hotel is the bar on the premises . Between Steven , Her ##iber ##to , Mo ##ira , Rafael , and of course Danny . . . . it can get no better . These people make your experience the best time ever . They take care of you from the time you walk in until the time you leave . The Chad Will ##ets is an absolutely fantastic piano player that will feel un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly happy that you came to listen . If you are looking for a place to get a cocktail or spend the evening you can not go wrong coming to this establishment . Thank you from Rick and Chi ##ck ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel . Very quiet and perfect central location . This is my new favorite hotel in Chicago . Room was spacious and bed super comfortable . Show ##er was amazing . Really a great stay . ( And a Du ##nk ##in close by ! ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Out of all the hotels in the area , I would definitely choose a different one next time I travel to Chicago . This hotel is extremely busy ( all the time ) , the staff are over worked and not very friendly , the rooms are very dated and could be cleaned better . The rewards lounge is also extremely busy and does not offer a great breakfast . The evening snack ##s are nice but the bar pricing is the same as if I were to go down to the lobby ( usually they are offered at a discount ) . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a cheaper conference hotel that needs some work . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I encountered the most lovely staff at this hotel . Given that there are 1200 rooms , the attention to the comfort of guests is as ##to ##und ##ing . I was especially impressed by Nicholas at the front desk upon check - in , as well as with front desk manager Taylor . While the b ##uff ##et breakfast was very good , I found it to be very expensive as compared to other top hotels in New York City and Boston ; that is my only modest criticism . In all other respects , your stay here will be a pleasant and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting one ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for business but it was a short sweet and simple . Leah at front desk checked me in with smiles and giggle ##s had me blush ##ing the whole time we were talking . I love the v ##ibes n the entry keep it up ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel nice location , room was com ##fy . Be ##ware though if you need anything extra you will be charged . They said they had a shuttle from airport . This is not free and also not a dedicated shuttle . They do not have room service ! Don ' t understand why . . . You have to pay for w ##if ##i of course . And they have a weird computer in rooms that is supposed to give you info on places to go but I chose what type of place I wanted and nothing happened . . . Let down . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel great location right on the Chicago River . We upgraded to a suite which is well worth doing also had a club room so breakfast was included . The rooms overlooking the river have spectacular views of all the buildings lit up at night . The room has every thing you would need for a comfortable stay . it is only a short walk from Michigan Avenue and a 10 minute walk from Navy pier . The staff on re ##se ##ption were very helpful [SEP]
1	[CLS] Soo ##oo ##o clean and beautiful ! We loved every single moment that we stayed there . . . I must say , it smells AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! The hotel is nicely situated to high end stores and many restaurants My husband and I highly recommend it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for two days over the weekend at the Hilton . I was able to upgrade my room under 100 dollars and was able f ##o have a top floor . The pool is nice , this is not a sponsored review either like the Mar ##riot and such . The employees were welcoming and the beds were so comfortable . The atmosphere was nice and relaxing . The room fit over 3 adults with 2 children . Right in the heart of the city . The only thing that didn ’ t work was the shower ##s where the drains not going down . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at Intercontinental hotels all over the world and this one is top notch . The front desk staff is friendly , efficient , and a pleasure to work with . The rooms are beautiful and well appointed . Another outstanding element is their house ##keeping staff . The rooms are im ##ma ##culate ( I am very pick ##y about clean ##liness ) and you can tell that they care . Every detail is well executed . The location is awesome and there ' s a very good Michael Jordan ' s St ##eak ##house in the hotel . I would H ##IG ##HL ##Y recommend this hotel to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My friend and I spent the night and loved the hotel and location . We attended " One of Kind " at the Me ##rch ##and ##ise Mart , and we were only 2 blocks away . Walk ##ed to restaurants and bars , everything right outside the door . Dan , at the front desk was very helpful and so friendly ! We will return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A pleasure to stay at this extremely elegant , s ##ty ##lish hotel . Rate was reasonable . Staff very pleasant and helpful . Room ##s clean & comfortable - will definitely return . The reception & lobby lounge are stunning . Within walking distance of main attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great staff , great room , recently updated , exceptional breakfast and evening offerings . We have been traveling to Chicago once a year for the past 8 years . The first six years we stayed in different hotels . The past 2 years and all future years , we will stay here . Just an overall great experience send value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I like Kim ##pton hotels as a rule , and this was no exception . It was my first stay at this property and everything was perfect . Staff were very helpful ; room is clean and comfortable ; and location is right near River North / the Loop / Michigan Avenue . It is also a short walk from the Blue line train from OH ##are . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great for a weekend trip . Room clean and pet ##ite but with all amenities ( fridge , coffee , toilet ##ries ) . Great location . Both v ##alet and self - parking nearby . Restaurant ##s a ##bound nearby . Room service available . Lo ##bby a bit cramped at times . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were there for a weekend stay . We were able to walk to Navy Pier and enjoy the boats going up and down the river from our room . When we checked in we were a disappointed that the pool was closed since we had planned on using it with our family . She ##rato ##n had made arrangements with the hotel across the street so we could still swim . [UNK] Great mattress ##es and room was very comfortable te ##mp wise . Close your d ##rap ##es so that the sun late in the day keeps your room cooler ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had heard The Conrad was old and why did I book there but not true ! ! ! From the moment we drove up we were treated like we were important people ! I had a million questions and everyone was so helpful and kind and I didn ' t feel in ##ti ##mi ##dated at all ! Room service was great ! The Lo ##bby desk crew were so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and nice ! ! The Baptiste & Bo ##ttle was great as well as the rooftop No ##yan ##e ! ! ! I W ##IL ##L be going back to The Conrad Chicago ! ! Thank you to all ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband & I stayed for an overnight recently . It was ma ##rve ##lous from start to finish ! The door ##man / v ##alet knew our names & room ; mentioned we had a great room - he was right ! Check - in was pro ##mpt . It was our anniversary & we had a bottle of champagne waiting & g ##ar ##rets pop ##corn ! Such a nice touch . This is our favorite Kim ##pton in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great location and enjoy this hotel ##E ##ver ##yon ##e is very friendly and the hotel is clean and inviting ! Dec ##or is nice for the holidays ! I would stay at this hotel again the near future ! I would recommend it [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this location . Close to magnificent mile , shopping stores , f ##ab restaurants . Breakfast was great and the team there is very helpful . I would stay here again and glad ##ly recommend it to someone . I had breakfast here as well and it was great value and quality . There is a 24 hour cafe 100 m ##ts away which is handy when you looking for something to eat if you are jet la ##gged [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was wonderful . View was pretty good ! I wish the hotel offered free newspaper in the morning . The room was comfortable . Security seemed lacking . The hall to the gym on 7th floor was a scene out of " The Shin ##ing " ; only the cameras made me feel better . I think the elevators should be key card access only like Lo ##ews . Overall good experience . Clean , comfortable and very nice staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , on E Grand just blocks from Michigan Ave Sur ##rou ##nded by stores , restaurants Re ##ception on 6th floor , hotel serviced by just 2 elevators which can get a little busy at times Vale ##t parking only @ $ 59 a day and it takes about 15 min ##s to bring your car . Service was good and as long as you factor that into your plans there are no issues . Good breakfast with the spread changing everyday Room ##s are newly renovated , a ta ##d small for Home ##wood suites . But it is downtown Chicago so what do you expect ? All in all , nice place and would stay there again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was a great bang for the b ##uck . I would recommend this hotel to anyone for a place to stay especially in the Gold Coast area of Chicago . Food in the P ##ump Room ( hotel lobby ) was also quick and delicious which is a plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just held our second meeting in three years and once again the hotel delivered . The facilities a ##r well kept , clean and fun . The location is central to all that Chicago has to offer . The staff goes out of their way to make sure that every need is met . The food , both in the restaurant and banquet ##s was great . I look forward to taking my meeting there again next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check - in was easy , if a bit odd with the lobby on the 20th floor . The staff was helpful and un ##ob ##tr ##usive , the cleaning well done , all the services were well provided in a time ##ly manner . Check ##out was a breeze and the even had a taxi waiting when I got downstairs ! I love when the hotel is the least stress ##ful part of traveling . I had no issues with the hotel , and they handled any questions or special requests with ease and a friendly attitude , even at 3 ##am ! Overall this hotel made an excellent place to stay as I played tourist in one of America ' s biggest cities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The entire family loves this hotel ! Great location , and rooms that are well designed for a family stay . Staff from front desk , to house keeping , to restaurant are court ##eous and understand what good customer service is . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I worked with Veronica to organize a business event . The event was a huge success from start to finish thanks for Veronica & Randy . The staff was helpful , and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We will be back again for future events ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here while interview ##ing for a job . There ' s such a great old feel to this place . The bar is cool and jazz ##y . You couldn ' t ask for a better location . The room was not as memorable as the general hotel and area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a 4 night break a the She ##rato ##n Grand . The hotel is well situated within easy walking distance of most of the local attractions , such as Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue . The room we had was on the 17th Floor overlooking the river and was very clean and everything you needed for a vacation . The pool and gym were very good with plenty of towels etc . The staff were all pleasant , the con ##cier ##ge and door staff being excellent . Although the hotel is huge it never felt crowded and we would def ##iant ##ly stay there again if we were visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we stayed here , everything was top notch . Love the s ##ty ##lish , comfortable , room ##y suites . The staff were very friendly and at ##ten ##tive to every detail . Great location , and lots of amenities . All in all a wonderful spot to stay if you are visiting the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff is very friendly and welcoming Breakfast ta ##sty good juice ##s and past ##ries But a lot of noise in my room due to closing doors at my floor from staff or customers Quite difficult to rest during the day Fitness well equipped [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here a couple of times and will be back for sure . The location is walking distance to most downtown favorites . The hotel is clean , the staff is nice & it is very affordable . You can ’ t beat the quality / price / location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had to cancel my reservation that was paid in pull last minute due to a family emergency . Katie at the hotel was very kind and handled the re ##fu ##nd even though they did not have to . For this I will 100 % pick this hotel when I have a work trip in Chicago next month . Thanks Katie ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our sixth time staying here at Christmas time . It ’ s the perfect location for the Christmas market , theater , shopping and dining . The de ##cor is Art Dec ##o and beautifully done . Happy hour in the lobby is one of my favorite things about the hotel . The rooms are comfortable . We ’ ve stayed in the regular king and larger king rooms . It ’ s nice to have the extra space but the smaller rooms are totally fine . We always get the parking package and it is a good value for Chicago ’ s high prices . All staff at the hotel are friendly . We don ’ t bring pets but they are pet friendly and I don ’ t see that it ’ s ever a problem for anyone . It ’ s rare I love a hotel but I do love this one . I highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve never stayed at a Home ##wood Suite ##s property and I will consider the brand again . This property is in an te ##rri ##fic location in Chicago - walk - able to excellent restaurants and business centers . The lobby is a good space for small team meetings and the breakfast bar was very clean and offered a variety of traditional and healthy breakfast choices . My room was very comfortable . I was only there for 1 night but I could easily imagine being there for several nights and h ##unk ##ering down comfortably . The kitchen ##ette is well appointed , the bathroom and closet are a good size . The room is essentially a high - end studio apartment in the heart of Chicago . Perfect for me . Staff were lovely and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I will absolutely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 5 days towards the end of August . Check ##ing was a breeze , the manager was super friendly and made us feel welcome from the start . Great location as it ’ s near so family attractions . With a one year old it was great to walk or take a short ride back to an afternoon nap / break . View of the river and the city was an added bonus . Look forward to visiting in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel and location . Staff are helpful and at ##ten ##tive . Great view of the lake . The Gold ex ##per ##in ##ce is the way to go . The con ##sie ##rges are helpful and got us into some great restaurants without the wait . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Large suite rooms . Full kitchen ##s , lots of electrical outlets , strong w ##if ##i signal , evening social with real food . Bed ##s are comfortable . Located near a city mall with lots of restaurants and food options nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s too bad this is the only Swiss ##ote ##l in the US ! I stay in Swiss ##ote ##l ‘ s in Switzerland . This property in Chicago is a fine example of their fashionable yet comfortable hotels ( but without R ##ö ##st ##i on the menu ) . Great location too to the sights , restaurants etc . Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful staff ( shout out to the Bell ##men ! ! ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ing at the Palmer Hilton Hotel for NY ##E weekend with my boyfriend and it is stunning ! Beautiful de ##cor , lovely staff , great area for shopping ! Very close to H & M , Sa ##cks off of 5th , Z ##ara , and Macy ’ s . Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel . Great work ##out facility with card ##io machines and plenty of free weights / machines . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was tired and did not want to go out to get something to eat . I called room service and asked if they could make me a p ##eanut butter and j ##elly sandwich . The woman taking my order was wonderful ! Very so ##licit ##ous , asking all f the correct questions . I was shocked when I signed for that sandwich . They had charged me $ 28 . 00 and some change ! ! Hotels need to get a grip . This was ridiculous ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In the City for a family wedding for 3 nights . Excellent location in the City . . . staff ( all inclusive ) was great . . . rooms were clean and comfortable . . . very good experience . Would recommend to anyone . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Palmer House A Hilton Hotel is a f ##abulous hotel . It is huge . There is an interesting history of the hotel , from the great Chicago fire to celebrity guests like Charles Dickens , Oscar Wilde , Frank Sinatra , Louis Armstrong , and many more . The hotel is im ##ma ##culate and the rooms are beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were treated well as a member of Le Club A ##cco ##r , their rewards program , with compliment ##ary beverages and an upgrade together with at ##ten ##tive , g ##rac ##ious service throughout the hotel , bar and restaurant . Location and am ##eni ##tes were first class all the way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here on July 23 - 26 . The location of this hotel is just perfect and right across Mill ##eni ##um Park . My room is bigger than what I thought having big couch . Was ##h / shower room is nice with separate shower and tub . There is a powder table right beside the walk - in closet . The room is equipped with a mini bar fridge . Bed and pillows are very comfortable . Room is very clean with great room and turn ##down service . Check - in and check - out was quick and they checked me in earlier because I came early . Sur ##rou ##nding area is very quiet and peaceful . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , location , location . You pay for it but it ' s also an un ##beat ##able location on N . Michigan Ave , a few blocks N . of the river and a couple blocks south of water tower place . Room was nice , luxury hotel quality , really more of a suite , with a separate living room . Beautiful high def t ##v ##s . As I recall , there was some sort of charge for using w ##if ##i , or at least for getting high speed ( you can look this up or ask ) , which I find annoying in hotels that are charging this much . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Ambassador East for years until it became the Public and then after 2 bad experiences moved elsewhere . The new owners of the Ambassador Chicago seem to be trying very hard - rooms were still sparse , hallway carpet needed cleaning , and hallway walls needed to be live ##ned up . Bed ##s were very com ##fy and really liked the addition of window shades . A / C worked fairly well - you needed to shut it down and then start it back up otherwise it became a little too cold . What was missing ? Din ##ing options in the hotel ( especially for b ##k ##fs ##t or a ni ##te arrival ) , a coffee ##maker in the room , a non ##s ##lip mat in the tub , and an option of a blanket & sheet on the bed vs the lightweight but warm du ##vet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small but not too small . Great rooms and great staff . Very convenient to be able to have breakfast in your own room . Wish ##ed it included some lighter options but good enough . Steps away from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile in the heart of River North . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Another awesome experience at O ##m ##ni Chicago Hotel . Thank you to Hans and Steve for having such a quality group of employees who make customer service the top priority ! They always exceed our expectations . We cannot wait for our next visit ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel makes easy walking access to museums , bean , restaurants , shopping , excellence staff , lobby personnel extremely helpful answering all our questions , food excellent , hotel and rooms great . Historic hotel building . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! Close to everything including public transport . Re ##ception very friendly on arrival , door staff great . Room was clean and decent shower pressure . Bit gut ##ted the pool was closed . Didn ’ t use the gym or go to the bar but both looked reasonable . Bell staff were a bit rude , we could hear them moaning about us tip ##ping . Not all countries do it so it ’ s a bit strange for us especially when the service isn ’ t that great anyway , it should be earned not expected . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Like ##d the most - Good property with very good location . Good staff . Like ##d the least : Not enough in room storage - closet ##s and drawers and van ##ity - the informal dining offer was not good even for breakfast . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been staying at the H ##ya ##tt Regency in Chicago for years for business and they always exceed my expectations . The hotel and staff is clean , excellent service , early check - in , always helpful . This is my go to hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We used the hotel for a business event and we found that both conference center and private areas are of high quality . Room ##s are spacious and well lit , and staff is always ready to help . Also appreciate the 24 / 7 room service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the last 2 years . It is always a great landing spot ; with great service , clean rooms , quiet during evening hours . The compliment ##ary happy hour is a plus . Nice sized work out room [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have recently joined the Hilton Fitness Center and I have been very happy with my choice . It is only a little more expensive than most health clubs but it is an o ##asis in the middle of the city . It has a pool with w ##hir ##l ##pool spa , a track , and all of the equipment that is standard for a well equipped gym . I love the ladies locker room where there are full length locker ##s , a sa ##una , plenty of mirrors , very clean and room ##y shower ##s , and no end of clean , clean towels . Mostly I love Dar ##nell ##a , the attendant who keeps everything spot ##less and is very cheerful and welcoming . It ' s a g ##em ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful historic hotel with a tremendous staff . Everyone , from hotel operator to front desk agent , were very polite , professional and helpful . Made me feel like I was really welcomed . Great location close to everything in the Loop and Gold Coast . This hotel is highly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As expected service and hotel experience for the H ##ya ##tt . Always good customer service . Was upgraded to a room with a view of the river since we were celebrating my birthday . Hotel was pretty low key with CO ##VI ##D still going . Bed ##s are always very comfortable . Overall a great experience as we usually have at all H ##ya ##tt hotels [SEP]
1	[CLS] The whole experience was very good , friendly , helpful staff , clean comfortable room , very comfortable bed , close to many attractions . Walking distance to everywhere . Very happy with this property and would stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very nice stay , which was unfortunately marred by waiting for 45 minutes for breakfast on the day of departure which meant we were then running late . Not the end of the world but could be improved upon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My friend and I stayed at this hotel during a quick weekend trip . This hotel is beautiful when you walk in , it gives you that old classic feel . We had a room with two queen beds and it was still very spacious for us and all of our belongings . The room was very clean and kept up with during our whole stay . The cleaning staff did a wonderful job during our stay ! The bathroom was large and very clean . It ’ s in a great location of restaurants and nearby attractions ! I would definitely return for another stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hospitality . Clean and fresh . Room ##s were small but very adequate . Lots of hot water in a great tub shower . In the middle of downtown on the miracle mile . Walking is so easy . I must say the weather was warm for Chicago February . I ’ ll be back thanks hotel staff [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel met all our needs with reasonable cost . It was clean with com ##fy beds and good size rooms . The staff were all friendly and happy see to you . The location of the hotel is close to everything . The Hop on - Hop off bus is very near to the hotel . The subway train is a easy walk . Great place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We thought we booked a simple room . So we were amazed as we walked into a beautiful suite . What a wonderful place to stay right on Michigan Avenue . The down ##side is parking is a bit price ##y in this part of the city as it is the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been to Chicago many times but this was my first time at the Intercontinental Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Fair ##ly small lobby feels a little he ##ctic at times . Nice ##ly appointed Executive Suite with amazing views of the city and lake and room larger than I expected for an older hotel . House ##keeping service was great and room well maintained . Fe ##lt a little s ##ter ##ile with not much “ personality ” but still nice . Couldn ’ t seem to get room cool enough so shut the heat off and was much more comfortable . Dinner at Michael Jordan ##s was excellent and nice to have Star ##bu ##cks right in the lobby . Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent meeting space and excellent banquet food and beverage . Staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been to Chicago many times , but this visit sincere ##ly was beyond belief ! Gretchen greeted me and immediately I knew this would be my best visit to Chicago ! I have stayed at about every hotel in this city , but never have I received a welcome like this . Not only me , but others in the lobby were all about Gretchen we w ##ll ! She is an outstanding ambassador for Chicago and the entire Kim ##pton chain . I truly appreciate her and her outstanding customer service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every detail was covered at the Conrad and contributed to a wonderful experience ! Each staff member greeted us with a smile and was there to help make our stay the best possible . Thank you for a memorable Chicago stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great team to check me in to the hotel . Clean and inviting lobby . Nice market in the lobby that ' s open 23 hours , closed between 2 ##am - 3 ##am . Stock ##ed with salad ##s , snack ##s and a few Star ##bu ##cks fresh made drinks . It ' s all good . I would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice people . The room was big and very comfortable . But . . . for having over 200 rooms , they have two elevators and one was out of order for the entire two weeks were there . I was told by people who have stayed there before , that it wasn ' t unusual for that to be the case . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this location and the hotel staff are great . The restaurant is great looking out on Michigan Ave . Very nice room and shower pressure was fantastic . Great value . I have stayed there a few times and always get what I expect , a great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The facility was M ##OR ##E than willing to help you with anything you needed at anytime and was very re ##sp ##ons ##ive to any issues that you may have ( Internet connection issue and a sticky door ) . I was here for a conference and therefore couldn ' t really relate on the value as we had a special room rate . The food was very good . I am not a big city person and therefore the location wasn ' t ideal for me , but I can see for someone who like easy walking to many shops and restaurants , this was an ideal location . There is on - site parking but be sure to ask about availability during the booking and reservations for parking if necessary . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is older but well maintained . Room ##s with fans are somewhat noisy . Bath ##room amenities are very good . North ##side of hotel faces construction - f ##yi . Has some great am ##bian ##ce that seems hidden - Second floor for example . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location with Shu ##la ' s steak ##house inside hotel and near river ##walk . The hotel was clean . Rain ##ed one of the days and the hotel lost t ##v signal the entire day . We had to watch the fight on our phones . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel with fitness center including locker ##s and pool on 7th floor . Co ##m ##fort ##able lounge for pu ##rch ##asa ##ble upgrade , with compliment ##ary breakfast ( hard boiled eggs , g ##rano ##la , me ##lons , pine apple , cereal , c ##rois ##san ##ts ) and even snack ##s ( egg rolls , cut ve ##gg ##ies , dip ) in the evening . This hotel was part of conference group offer . Whole Foods 2 blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a special trip for my son ' s 6th birthday and the staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , providing a nice gift for us in our room . The hotel is very convenient to shopping and food . I usually stay at another Hilton property when in Chicago , but will consider this again next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The property is central ##ly located , not on the river , which could have been very nice . Interest ##ingly the lobby was located on the 20 th floor and our room on the 17 th . We had a very nice room , no view which could have made the stay top of the line . The rooms are private and quiet . Electrical blind ##s and sheer ##s which was great . 65 inch flat screen TV which had an amazing picture . The king bed was very comfortable and try he linen ##s and comfort ##er were very nice . The bathroom was outstanding , private toilet and awesome shower with double van ##ities in a nice contemporary design . Coffee machine included with great coffee . Nice robes and slip ##pers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were large and well appointed . Great location , near red line and ma ##g mile . Friendly staff . Breakfast included is a great feature when travelling with kids . The evening social was also a lovely touch that made the hotel seem to have a personal touch [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a incredibly gorgeous hotel . Be sure to check out the Peacock Door , and some of the ball rooms if you ' re able to . The ch ##and ##elier ##s are something to be ##hold ! Hilton , as usual , provides a great hospitality experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room service was as T ##ER ##RI ##BL ##E as you might expect given the other reviews . Wish we had he ##ede ##d them . . My daughter ended up getting sick after eating the food . We had our grandchildren with us and had to wait more than an hour and a half to get food - - and then the order wasn ' t even close to what we asked for . Dec ##ided to get up and see if it would be better to go to breakfast in the morning . After we were finally shown our table , we waited more than fifteen minutes and still no one came to see if we would like coffee or to take an order . And we were the only ones in the whole place . The con ##cier ##ge wasn ' t much better . Lac ##k ##luster and di ##sin ##ter ##ested . Very disappointing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay . The room was magnificent , the staff was even better . We needed a refrigerator and it was brought to our room in less than 5 minutes . There isn ' t a single negative comment to say - thank you for a wonderful stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love this place ! ! We go to Chicago several times a year , and every time , this hotel is transformed a little more ! They ' re going through a complete updated renovation , and is ##t simply my hotel of choice in Chicago ! Maybe I shouldn ' t tell you ? ? The people at the front desk are incredibly a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and always make us feel welcome ! Recently had a big family party in Chicago , and they accommodate ##d us greatly ! Can ' t say enough about it ! Every room is wonderful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This property is a special property . the people that work here really want to make a difference and you see that from the time you get our of the car , check in , your passing through the lobby and your check out . You are truly not a number at the Talbot ##t , but someone that they appreciate and are glad you are staying with them [SEP]
0	[CLS] Am ##ids ##t the the obligations of our work related trip , we were able to un ##wind and enjoy the sites . The staff was friendly and helpful . The atmosphere was warm and welcoming , yet exciting and energetic . Everything from the meeting rooms to the meals provided via our organization was excellent . We especially enjoyed the restaurants and the living room . H ##ya ##tt Regency of Chicago was the perfect mix to be able to relax and un ##wind after business hours . We hope to return someday soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We felt like cattle at this hotel . There was a lack of customer service or personal ##ization to the experience . I ' ve never stayed at a hotel were I felt so under ##val ##ued . We were ch ##ast ##ised for asking for bottle ##d water ( there was none in the room ) , we were charged in advance for incident ##als but there were no con ##su ##mable ##s ( or mini bar ) in the room , the room rate dropped nearly $ 50 from our advanced purchase price but we were unable to negotiate an adjustment . I would not stay here again . This hotel is about the numbers , not the personal experience of its guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed two nights on a family trip and relied heavily on U ##ber and L ##y ##fts to get around the city . The hotel and all ride services won ' t allow pick ups on the Michigan Ave so you have to go south to Upper Illinois to get picked up . Many of our drivers ended up going to Lower Illinois and it ' s a maze to get up to the correct level . The hotel itself is nice , helpful front desk staff , rooms were nice . We had drinks at Michael Jordan ' s bar in the lobby which were good , but bar was very noisy with conversation and the actual staff , making lots of noise behind the bar with dishes and glasses . The indoor pool is historic , but looks pretty out ##dated and the entire room felt like a sa ##una even with windows open . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for 5 nights . I got a great last minute deal on the room . The room was large and clean . Bed was pretty comfortable as well . The location was excellent and within walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars . I would definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cal ##va ##ca ##de of Author ##s book conference was home for this hotel . It is a f ##abulous site with all the staff so friendly and helpful . Love ##d the daily evening cocktail ##s to un ##wind from sights ##ee ##ing , etc . Will definitely plan to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great quality in many respects : welcome , rooms , sa ##ni ##tary , service , breakfast , environment , con ##cier ##ge . Outstanding location for business , visits , shopping , entertainment . Sound - proof ##ing in room is a reality . Worth its price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a conference here for a couple of days and everyone I came in contact with was very kind and professional . Especially David who went the extra mile to accommodate me . He even called to confirm my request . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location great . Lo ##bby amazing . Co ##sts high . Check in great but service otherwise in ##different . Executive floor was a joke . The food and drink on offer was limited and poor and useless for ve ##get ##arians . Room ##s ok but ta ##tty and tired . This hotel is great if your company is paying . I was disappointed thus did not meet Hilton ' s usually good standards . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our stay at The O ##m ##ni Chicago was excellent ! ! We booked the American Girl Pack ##age and it was wonderful ! I would definitely recommend this hotel and we will be staying at the O ##m ##ni again ! The staff was amazing and went above and beyond ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Large attractive clean and well appointed rooms . Good outlets . Room ##s have a small coffee pot . They push the mini ##bar and snack ##s by having them dominating the c ##red ##en ##za . Restaurant ##s include Star ##bu ##cks and Shu ##las . Good gym with small pool and p ##elo ##ton bikes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel which is central ##ly located . The rooms are a good size , beds amazing ##ly comfortable and the help yourself breakfast very convenient . There is also a happy hour where can ##ap ##és and wine , cocktail ##s and beer offered free . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend this great hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Clean and comfortable with great staff . The views were very nice and the hotel was affordable . It is in a perfect location so you can walk to all the great restaurants in Chicago . I would definitely recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great , that ' s about it . The bed was uncomfortable , and the pillows were the worst I ' ve ever slept on . It felt like I was sleeping on plastic , literally plastic . As for the bathroom , the mirror was broke and covered in dust . Extreme ##ly dirty . Very disappointed for a four star hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed here as part of a business conference in Chicago . Location was fantastic - just steps from the river walk and also very close to Michigan Ave , Millennium Park , etc . Staff was extremely friendly as well . The rooms were quite large and extremely clean . Fitness centre was average for a larger hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel in great part of the city . Only negative , is cost - it ' s very expensive . I was there on a conference and so had a decent rate on the room but lots of little charges . For example , I had a package delivered to the hotel ( Amazon purchase ) and was charged a $ 10 " handling fee " . . . ! ! The item ( laptop charge ##r ) only cost me $ 25 to buy ! Also to get a late check - out after 11 am costs 50 % of the room rate at a minimum ! Also heard from another conference attend ##ee that parking was going to cost him $ 70 per night ! Nice hotel - just watch out for all the additional costs . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel Monaco Chicago is central ##ly located very close to the river in Chicago . This is a great location that makes it easy to get to everything in Chicago . I had a great experience . The room was clean , room ##y , comfortable , and had a great view . The w ##i - fi was fast and free . Best of all , they provide free loan ##er bikes ( and helmets ) that are extremely useful for getting around downtown Chicago . Although the bikes are re ##tro 3 speed jobs with coaster brakes , they are more than adequate for riding around the relatively flat areas of central Chicago . As the hotel is close to the river and the lake , there are many nice possible rides that are very close to the hotel . This will certainly be my hotel of choice when I go to Chicago from now on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about this hotel was great , from the rooms to the friendly staff especially D ##wayne , was all so friendly and helpful . He took out the time to check our U ##ber every time we left the hotel . This is a must stay in Chicago ! I will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we stepped foot in the front doors , our experience with the Ki ##nz ##ie staff and hotel was exceptional ! The entire staff is extremely polite and professional ; very friendly ! The Ki ##nz ##ie hotel is in a great location ; in walking distance to the Chicago River , an o ##obe ##r amount of restaurants and bars . . . plenty of entertainment . The hotel is V ##ER ##Y clean and modern . The daily continental breakfast ( offered on every floor ) and happy hour was convenient . . . nice touch ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved walking in to see the hotel still decorated for the holidays ! The check in line was a bit long but the service was friendly . I requested a two bedroom / two bath suite but somehow ended up with three rooms that when connected became one big suite - - four beds , four bathroom ##s , five mini fridge ##s , three coffee pots . For four people , it was plenty of room for sure ! The rooms were pretty standard - - I was surprised there wasn ' t a mini ##bar . We had one cleaning issue - - there was days old pizza in an un ##p ##lug ##ged fridge , pretty gross . We tried to call for room service at 8 ##pm on a Wednesday , but it was closed that day ! ! Still , the view of the lake , the museum campus and Navy Pier was a wonderful treat . The hotel is so convenient to the attractions . Re ##com ##men ##ded . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed there for three nights . We found it an excellent hotel in all respects . The lounge and central hallway ##s were like a classical Paris ##ienne hotel . Wonderful ceilings and columns . The hotel has tonnes of history associated with it as evidenced in the photos and me ##mor ##abi ##lia on all floors . The bedroom was classical ##ly decorated . The inclusive breakfast was more than enough for us ve ##gan ##s . The staff were friendly and helpful . The gym too was well equipped and maintained . And of course the location was perfect in regard to shopping , sites , theatres , restaurants and public transport . 1600 rooms by the way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recommend staying at this hotel but more specifically stay on one of the floors that give you access to the gold lounge . Excellent staff . Sharon , Man ##dan ##a and T ##ip ##hani are awesome . The services was pro ##mpt and the advice they gave on restaurants was spot on . My family is joining me at the end of my trip , and they were very helpful with that transition as well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] There is no particular reason to stay at this hotel . For the price you pay I ’ m certain you could get a nice ##r more comfortable stay elsewhere . We were very disappointed in most aspects of our stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was great , but suites windows and curtains did not block out noise effectively . Hotel is very close to hospital and multiple ambulance ##s pass by the school night . If was disappointing because everything else was great perhaps rooms with fewer windows and facing slightly different direction do not have same problem [SEP]
1	[CLS] 1 . Love ##d location . Rod ##e blue line in from O ' Hare and only had a 7 minute walk to hotel . It is close to everything . 2 . Continental breakfast . The breakfast is on every floor in the morning next to elevator common area and is very nice . 3 . Happy Hour . We were given token ##s when we got there for a happy hour they have every afternoon beginning at 5 . This included any drink you could imagine and great finger foods . 4 . Staff was good for information and assistance . The only criticism is there were bell hop ##s and others in lobby who I thought would open doors and help with luggage but that was not the case . 5 . Room was contemporary and large . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall location and clean ##liness of the room was good . We have stayed at many different hotels in the are . We like this one the best as the proximity to shopping , eating and night life was the best . We would def ##inate ##ly stay at this hotel again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice location within walking distance of many places . Staff was friendly and helpful . Room ##s were ok and , I thought , more expensive than ought to have been . Car ##pet ##s needed vacuum ##ing . While I know hotel rooms are places others have stayed I expect more attention to detail for the price . The rooms were quiet given the city environment and they had nice city ##sca ##pes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s kinda sad . This Chicago I ##con was supposed to be renovated ? ! It has a Fantastic location , but that is all ! Not enough staff . Can ’ t tell what they did to the Grand Old P ##ump Room & it is only open Very limited hours . The junior suit was large enough , but filled with bout ##ique ch ##ic hotel furniture that didn ’ t fit . The bathroom wasn ’ t Clean ; cracked mirror & g ##rung ##y g ##rout . Yu ##ck ! Please try harder guys . This has been a Real Chicago landmark . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary and the hotel and staff couldn ’ t have been nice ##r ! Special recognition to April and Kris ##top ##her who were exceptional . The hotel was recently renovated and the rooms are amazing . The location on Michigan avenue is perfect for dining and recreation . I would absolutely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is older and charming . The attached restaurant is great for B ##runch , Lu ##nch and Dinner . The Bar is lively . I liked this hotel for many reasons . It is a great bargain given the location and style of the hotel . Our room was plenty large and the bathroom were spacious as well . Many wonderful things to do in this great city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 3 nights for a mother / daughter trip to see Hamilton . So happy with our stay . All staff members were perfection - bell ##man , front desk , cleaning , happy hour staff , etc . We appreciate the happy hour and took advantage 2 of the 3 nights . Hotel is right by the river and close to theaters . We walked everywhere , even to Second City which was a little too far for me - took a cab back to hotel . Coffee offered in the morning and water all day . High ##ly recommend staying at this hotel . You will be well cared for and happy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent service at a beautiful hotel . Clean , modern , and very well located in downtown Chicago . The restaurant and bar are also wonderful . Staff is always on point and happy to help . I highly recommend staying here in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great hotel on the Ma ##g Mile . Room on the 19th floor was awesome . Travel ##ing with 2 children was easy . The hotel staff was fantastic . The front desk put us in a room facing the Trump tower with an excellent view . Also , when we were picked up by L ##y ##ft . . . the hotel staff helped with our luggage while the L ##y ##ft driver just sat in his car . High ##ly recommended hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My 1 night stay in the Monaco was a glowing example of Kim ##pton hospitality . The front desk staff were very g ##rac ##ious and helpful , the door ##man was quick to lend assistance with bags , and the sales team hosting the wine hour shared helpful information about the city . Both Eric in the bar and Dana at reception went out of their way to make my stay more comfortable . The room was exceptional . I was upgraded to a corner suite and the view of the river made my day . I believe the room had 4 window seats big enough to accommodate two adults . Very unique and something that certainly contributed to making the stay enjoyable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed At the H ##ya ##tt on Saturday night because we were running a 5 ##K on Sunday morning . The organized 5 ##K runs start a few blocks away from the hotel . The hotel is beautiful and is in a great place in the city [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed staying here . The location is great for walking to the subway , Michigan Ave , or the Lake ##front . The room was great for having the kids sleep on the pull ##out in the living room while still giving some privacy to the adults . Breakfast and evening reception were a great surprise ! We will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for our wedding in Chicago . we organised everything from abroad and the staff was just perfect : dedicated and pleasant . It made it truly special and unique . Thank you very much to everybody . Me ##rc ##i , and me ##rc ##i miss M . T ##rani ! Kind regards . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is a bit out of the way from trains but very close to Michigan Ave . The hotel is huge . I was staying two nights on a business trip . Everything is kind of standard for a name brand hotel . Nothing to bra ##g about and nothing much to complain about either . To be on the pick ##y side , I need to point out that the water pressure in my room was a bit on the high side . I know . I know . Most people probably would only complain when there is not enough water pressure in the room and I am doing the opposite . It is still quite bear ##able but water cannon treatment before bed time is a little out of ordinary I would say . Overall , it was still a fine stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My second visit to Chicago and third hotel in the City . Have to say was absolutely brilliant . Po ##si ##tion ##ed in the trend ##y gold coast area that felt like being in Paris but warmer . Never been brought a cold beer whilst checking in before , nice touch . Room ##s were ok but excellent for the price . Can ' t think why I would book anywhere else in the city in future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great property , location and staff . Food ( St ##ets ##on ' s ) was outstanding ! Room was quite nice with comfortable bed . Staff was friendly and court ##eous at all times . For the conference I attended the location was excellent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed in Santa Suite for the price paid . G ##ar ##bage on all the tables throughout even though lots of employees standing around . This was our first impression . The food consisted of cotton candy , chocolate pre ##tz ##el rods , cookies , and candy . There was a charge for beverages other than hot chocolate , tea , and coffee . An orange juice will set you back $ 9 . Santa seemed to be on hand just for photo op and not to talk to kids . Ex ##pect ##ed more for the money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time in Chicago - want to come back ! This hotel was great in different ways . Room was lovely - it was great to have a separate bedroom and a lounge to sit in . Very clean and quiet . Had the breakfast b ##uff ##et which was excellent - lots of choice , good quality fresh food and you can get your eggs done the way you want . Very relaxing start to the day . Small swimming pool which was good for a we ##e dip ( particularly after a hot day ) - flu ##ffy towels available to use . Small gym too with a variety of equipment and outside a we ##e terrace with some lounge ##rs to relax on . Nice lounge bar with a lovely bar ##man who introduced me to water ##mel ##on vodka - y ##um ! All public areas of the hotel very clean and t ##idy and staff were very polite and helpful . Would not hesitate to stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only stayed one night at the She ##rato ##n Grand , but everyone at the hotel was court ##eous , professional , and helpful . The room was very nice , and it was great to be right on the river . The shower may have been the best damn shower I ' ve ever had in a hotel ; the water pressure was so good it was like a religious experience and sadly ruined me for all other shower ##s . If you do the self parking package , you basically just drive into the parking structure and when you leave you press the " assistance " button and give them your name / room number . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt has everything you need if staying in town . From the food choices to the Big Bar for a few drinks you can get something you want . Easy access time the p ##ed ##way gives you several options to visit outside locations without going outside immediately . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here three nights . The location is very convenient for visit loop . The staff in this hotel very friendly and professional . But the room is very old and facilities need a renovation . The room rate is too high to match the number we paid . The parking price is too expensive so , if you drive during the stay in loops , I would suggest find a lot nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with a friend but on a very good deal from Travel ##zo ##o . We asked to get two singles but because of our deal were quoted an additional $ 30 per night , that was then dropped by $ 10 which was nice . We required a fridge as we were doing a lot of self catering and one was provided with no issues . Bed ##s are super comfortable . . . . I want one . I wasn ' t happy with $ 300 de ##ducted from my credit card for incident ##als for our 4 night stay . That drained my account and after a chat to the Manager , Michael , he was able to sort something for me that re ##ct ##ified my money issues . Very good service from him and the other staff we encountered during our stay . They have c ##rois ##san ##ts ' to go ' complementary early morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 2 nights at this property . The pool is on the 19th floor & offers great city views . Breakfast is hot & a variety of choices are offered . Social hour could be used instead of dining out , but food is more snack than meal . At ##ten ##tive staff , especially v ##alet . All suite property with kitchen makes it perfect for families . One block from red - line subway stop . Short walk to shopping & dining . Would absolutely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is well situated , check in was a bit slow and the bathroom in my room needs a little T ##LC but those would be my only complaints . The rooms are small but comfortable and well appointed . The hallway ##s are like a museum with pictures of all the stars that played the Empire Room . The ceiling in the bar area off the lobby is amazing . A great hotel to stay in , if you want a sense of Chicago ’ s history . They also have a shoe shine stand at street level with a wonderful gentleman who gives a great shoe shine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose to stay at Home ##wood suite this time because the one other time we came to Chicago , we stayed here too . I guess since 2012 , they ' ve re ##mo ##del ##ed , and probably to make more room to rent out more rooms , they cut down on space in the hotel lobby and breakfast area , and to me took away the beauty and home ##y feel of the hotel . We did have a great experience there though . Better than average breakfast . We stayed in a suite , and it was pretty room ##y for all of us . Staff was very friendly and super helpful whenever we needed a ##asis ##tan ##ce . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##zy and s ##ty ##lish room ! A ##pp ##re ##cia ##ted the extra things offered in the room , especially for getting ready . L ##O ##VE ##D the compliment ##ary happy hour ! The only thing I wasn ’ t a fan of was our view . [UNK] Great location to restaurants , bars , music venues , and shopping ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , I was in Chicago for a convention and usually stay closer to McCormick Place . . . I ' m so glad I didn ' t this time . H ##ya ##tt Regency on W ##ack ##er is a better location to see more of Chicago . Location , service , food and clean ##liness was outstanding ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Honestly , so average . The place shows it ' s age big time . With all of the Air ##B ##N ##B ##s , bout ##ique hotels , and more to stay in Chicago ' s cool neighborhoods . . . . I ' m really not sure why you would choose this one . The pool is epic and incredibly but that ' s hardly the focus for a hotel . I ' ve had such a lovely time staying in hotels that truly treat you like royalty . At this one , I asked for bottles of water upon check - in and they said there would be some in the room . ( He ##h . ) On top of that , there are people happy to help ( . . . for a tip . . . ) At every turn . Pass on this one and choose something where you ' ll pay to truly enjoy your stay rather than staying in a box ##y room that feels like a time trip back to 2001 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We only stayed one night but this was our 4th stay at the Palmer House . A great location with friendly / efficient staff made our stay a pleasure ##able experience . Check in was a bit slow with a long line , but everything else was wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful two night stay . Book ##ed a del ##uxe room and was upgraded to a corner suite . Service from everyone ( check - in , restaurant , door ##men , con ##cier ##ge ) was top notch . Room had fantastic views . Bath ##room was very large with 2 sinks . Room ##s were ultra quiet . We never heard a door slam nor any noise from hallway ##s . Love ##d the 65 " TV ##s in living area and bedroom . This property is just steps from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed direct with the hotel for better value . We did arrive late evening due to flight delay issues but offered a discount ##ed upgrade to suite when we arrived which we took . Room ##s were spot ##less and well equipped . En ##joy ##ed the fact that the restaurant opened straight on to the street and the bar was popular . Service throughout was excellent and the weekend breakfast choice and quality was superb . Men ##u reduced during the normal week and less staff but always friendly , welcoming and efficient . Also well located near the Golden Mile . We would stay here again if we return to Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Of course swimming in the indoor pool is an experience in itself . Superior breakfast experience even with hotel full . Here I would especially thank the staff at the restaurant . Despite congress ( RS ##NA ) peak attendance , they were perfect , friendly , and efficient including the " personal chef " who prepares you a good plate and o ##mel ##ettes to start your day ! Con ##gratulations to the staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was im ##ma ##culate . Park on site was handy . Op ##tions for food were good . The little cafe / shop had Star ##bu ##cks and many other breakfast items to eat there or to go . Staff everywhere to help get you where you needed to go . Love the adult hot tub plus family hot tub . [SEP]
0	[CLS] St ##eep price for v ##alet parking which limited other options . Hotel was clean , nice and pleasant employees but the price wasn ’ t worth it . I will be staying at other hotels from now on . Food was available but at a steep cost . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time visiting Chicago and had a great time . The She ##rato ##n is central ##ly located next to everything . It ’ s right next to the river so it has some great views . If you don ’ t mind walking and getting some good fresh air , it ’ s not that far from the Navy Pier , the movie theater , a bowling alley , plenty of restaurants , and shops . T ##ip : make sure you check out the Whole Foods close by . . . it has a full bar with drinks specials [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at this beautiful hotel . The d ##é ##cor was f ##abulous and our room was amazing . The location is about 15 min walk from the heart of the city but if you make your way out of the hotel to the shore drive it is a f ##abulous walk , which takes you past the beach and the famous Drake Hotel . The whole am ##bie ##nce of the hotel was cool and ch ##ic and we highly recommend it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel has a great location in downtown that makes getting anywhere in the city easy . Above and beyond the location is the clean and comfortable rooms and amazing customer service . I go out of my way to stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie when I travel to Chicago for my business meetings due to consistency , quality , and comfort ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall an awesome downtown Chicago hotel and experience ! ! Excellent location and food ! Beautiful views and nice spacious rooms . The entire staff was very welcoming and the nearby shopping is amazing . We can ' t wait to return next month ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful bout ##ique hotel [UNK] . They are very detail oriented . Sen ##t my son a birthday [UNK] slice of cake with straw ##berries and two compliment ##ary bottles of fancy water . They also upgraded us to a king size suite . Would ’ ve liked the street view . Very large room nice bathroom with 2 robes and plenty of towels . Bed was very comfortable . Location is great next to plenty of restaurants and attractions . Didn ’ t get a chance to eat at their 312 Restaurant but the menu looked delicious . Overall a great experience and highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our 3rd stay at the hotel , and while we started out a bit rocky ( issue with our reservation ) , the hotel manager , C ##lar ##ice , was more than welcoming and helpful to assist . As I was searching for our reservation confirmation , C ##lar ##ice worked di ##ligent ##ly to re ##ct ##ify the issue on her end and all ended perfectly well . We no longer felt anxious and concerned about our hotel stay and enjoyed a wonderful week ' s stay in Chicago . Additionally , the breakfast ##s and servers were top notch , as were the bar folks . We will definitely stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker when we plan our next Chicago visit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The restaurant ( Columbus Ta ##p ) added two years ago , makes this my # 1 hotel in Chicago . Also , Man ##dan ##a is always cheerful and quick to help answer any questions , when I visit the Gold Lounge . If you ' re not Gold Lounge eligible , it ' s worth the upgrade . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a great experience staying here , Erin at the front desk was very helpful in giving me a good recommendation to dinner and also writing a kind note wishing me well for my interview . The room was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was able to check in early . The staff was friendly ( especially K ##wa ##me ) and my room was clean and quiet . Breakfast was good , and the bar was a nice place to un ##wind after a long day . The location is great - very close to the Hancock Tower and nice shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I were very pleased with our stay at the Fair ##mont Chicago . The location was perfect in that it was close to the parks , the river for the cruise ##s , the lake , shopping and restaurants . We found the staff to be quite helpful and court ##eous always with a smile . The room was exactly what we were expecting . Nice size , comfortable bed and pillows , a coffee machine and a lovely view . One night we unexpectedly saw fireworks from our room ! A special thank you to the hotel con ##cier ##ge , Gail , who helped us find our way by suggesting tours , restaurants and locations of tourist spots . It was the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary , hope to go back one day ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago truly held up to the Conrad H ##I ##lton name . It was easy to find and so close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent MI ##le as well as many restaurants and shops . The central location made it very easy to see multiple things . The room was gorgeous , made us feel like VIP ' s . Staff was very pleasant . We really enjoyed our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in here in August . The rooms were clean and the hotel was nice . We had 4 adults and two children in one room and it was very c ##ram ##med . The location of this hotel is great . Within walking distance of many shops and restaurants . Would definitely stay here again , but if we had the same amount of people I would get two rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are Kim ##pton fans so when our favorite Kim ##pton in Chicago , The Burn ##ham , was sold , we decided to try out this one located just a few blocks away and still in the Loop . Great location . Quiet . Very comfortable king bed . Room was on the small side and the bathroom had odd f ##rench doors . Everything was great - - just wish there had been a second chair . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here last week for a couple of days with family . Room ##s are excellent and really modern and clean . Location is perfect for exploring Chicago . Walk to She ##dd and Navy Pier . Right on shopping area . However it is extremely expensive at almost $ 300 a night . Too much in my opinion . [SEP]
1	[CLS] O ##m ##g not worth it . S ##pent 221 $ for one night and that was with a wedding block discount . Check in was 3 pm we arrived 330 . Room wasn ’ t ready . Had to stand at the check in for 15 minutes . Lady never even apologized for the wait or wished us a “ nice stay ” . She ##et on bed had a stain on it . Bath ##room wasn ’ t clean . Had tooth ##pas ##te marks on sink . Room is small . So not worth the money for downtown ch ##ica ##go . Way better ups ##cale hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ’ t stay on a cold night you ’ ll regret it ! We paid extra for the corner suite for the extra room and the view . The view was great but the room was sub par for one main reason a study head wind coming through the wall at the head of the bed causing 2 cold nights in Chicago . We I spoke to the front desk they agreed with me and said yes the corner rooms are draft ##y . We love Chicago and will definitely be back just not at the O ##m ##ni . The uncomfortable sofa bed shouldn ’ t be the Best place to sleep in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel but showing some signs of aging . Aside from some clean ##liness issues in our room and noticeable signs of aging ( chip ##ped paint , s ##cu ##ffs , etc ) we had a great stay . Walls are quite thin and noise can be an issue , but they have the most beautiful lobby I have ever seen , their location is 10 / 10 and ease of access and customer service is top notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had such a lovely stay here . Not only was the location perfect for everything that we wanted to do , the staff were friendly , welcoming and helpful . Sheila and Richard were extremely helpful in helping me to arrange a birthday surprise for my husband even before we arrived in the hotel . The room was spacious , clean and comfortable , offering a range of services and little additional touches . This was the best hotel stay I ' ve had in a long time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful service from staff ! I was greeted by pleasant , at ##ten ##tive , and helpful bell staff . K ##wa ##me assisted me with my registration at the front desk . He was very delight ##ful and provided fast and efficient service . The junior suite was fantastic ! ! Very clean and offered up to date amenities . I enjoyed grabbing a bite to eat at the bar . Food was great and bartender ##s were outstanding ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a beautiful hotel ! We had a fantastic time at the Swiss ##ote ##l ; the service was on - point and the staff very at ##ten ##tive . Ku ##dos to Veronica Navarro for making the experience memorable ; her attention to detail and custom ##ized service allowed me to enjoy my weekend without worry . I appreciate having a professional planning partner that feels more like a friend ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed her recently for the weekend , room was a suite and was okay , a bit dated . Bed was AM ##A ##Z ##ING - Co ##m ##fy and co ##zy ! ! Location is okay , but if you really want to be on the " Triangle " - Thompson hotel is closer . Bar was closed - disappointing [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed in around 20 hotels in Chicago . This by far is the best hotel and the location is also the best . The staff at check - in was very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The rooms are extremely clean and spot ##less . The beds were very soft , how I like them . The view was awesome looking at the John Hancock Building . The 18th floor had the hint of a s ##ku ##nk odor . Weird . I will be staying here again . Had a great stay for New Year ' s 2018 ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I went with my family and disappointed with the customer services , problem with the house ##keeping , didn ' t change the towels and beds , no soap , and in addition they charged for everything . The hotel was very nice , but for the services I didn ' t recommend and don ' t comeback . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was clean and gorgeous . People were friendly . Go see the Magic Show . It will be the highlight of your trip . He is beyond amazing . We were able to get on the executive level where we were able to get a free outstanding breakfast and small dinner each day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . great staff , clean room , I was always called by my name so it was super personal . Our con ##cier ##ge was awesome , he stayed with our bags until we got our car and helped us with our luggage . I would definitely bring my family back to this hotel again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent stay . All staff extremely polite and helpful . Booth One outstanding . Service and food excellent . I love a hotel where you can get of the elevator and go right into a first class restaurant and have an excellent meal . I also love the [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would like to thank all the staff for their friend ##liness and professional ##ity and Craig specially for his cord ##ial ##ity and cheerful ##ness . The location of the hotel is excellent : next to the lake , close to landmarks , shops , restaurants , etc Everything within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Te ##rrible rooms and very old and run down hotel . Need ##s an overhaul . W ##i ##F ##i did not work . Too noisy . Show ##er was awful . Tu ##b based BR . A ##w ##ful bed and linen . Would not stay here ever again . Stay away and save your money [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would highly recommend staying at the O ##m ##ni . Location was great to walk all over the city . The staff were very friendly and helpful . The room space was large and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting for larger groups . The conference room was also great for our group of 135 Women . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice ##ly located within Chicago ( i ##e close to the shore and shopping ) it allows you do experience Chicago . Nice and space ##y . Excellent hotel rooms that are very clean . Nice personnel . Also the business facilities are very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel that is in a prime location with beautiful views . Park ##ing is ridiculous ##ly expensive . The charge for parking was approx . 2 / 3 of the price of the room which is outrage ##ous . Try the hot chocolate , it is amazing [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great historic hotel and everything here is old and out ##dated . Personnel was terrible from front desk to restaurant hosts . hotel needs a major renovation . I This place should be a museum and facilities and service seems like they are stuck in time . Only great thing is close to everything . De ##fin ##ite ##ly would not recommend this place to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had to stay in Chicago overnight for our next day business trip . We chose this hotel for the brand and its location . Location was great , just on the river ##walk . However the hotel itself needs serious renovation . There is no laundry bag and no slip ##pers in the room . Breakfast is medium at best . Bed ##s were com ##fy though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a full service facility with multiple restaurant options . The only two major issues I encountered was with adjusting the heat ( took a while for the room to get warm ) and the pillows are much too soft ( took 3 pillows to equal one normal pillow ) . Generally very good service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice , clean , very comfortable bed . Room ##s too small ! Be ready to spend $ $ $ parking an additional $ 63 , bottle water in room $ 6 ! ! Really ! Ch ##ea ##p toilet paper . Coffee in am free ok . Evening drinks nice for those who drink . Ask ##ed for senior discount would only grant if reserved online . . . really . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here during a trip with the high school marching band and choir . No restaurants in this hotel but many local restaurants deliver . Room ##s were clean and quiet . This is considered a bout ##ique hotel and the staff was court ##eous and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a return visit and once again was excellent . We have two boys ( 11 / 12 ) and one has severe all ##er ##gies . The restaurant staff were amazing . We had a separate menu prepared every day which all ##ay ##ed any fears . The room was spacious with fantastic bed linen . The bar is also excellent . The location is also superb . We ' ll be returning again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is well situated to get around town . The rooms are spacious and well kept on a daily basis . My issue was the parking is Vale ##t and after 3 days my new Lex ##us arrived at the hotel v ##alet with a nice chunk of paint out of the passenger door which was not discovered until i stopped to gas up ? Why O ##m ##ni ? Vale ##t Park ##ing should ensure this would not happen ? Please tell me what happened in your Vale ##t Park ##ing G ##ara ##ge ? [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved our 3 day stay . The staff was wonderful . We were walking distance to great restaurants and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . We would recommend if you want a luxury feeling stay here . Be sure to take the hotel tour . The swimming pool is beautiful and the view from the lounge is just un ##believable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A 1920s dream . The op ##ule ##nce began at drop - off . I was greeted by a cheerful door ##man . It was 10 ##pm after a full work - week , so I appreciated that . The lobby is breath ##taking . My room was modern with simple ch ##ic de ##cor . I opted for the breakfast package . The breakfast b ##uff ##et had great selections and creative offerings , like a p ##ear m ##uff ##in . I really enjoyed my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very , very nice suite , meeting room and lobby area . Food was excellent ! Front desk staff were very polite and professional . Very surprised to find my room turned down for the night with music on and sweet treats . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is close to Michigan Ave . , spacious , clean , tech smart , great views , and has my f ##ave N ##es ##press ##o coffee in the room . There are two restaurants , one on the roof . [UNK] The best of all is the bed , very comfortable , got a great nights sleep . A little price ##y but T ##rea ##t Yourself ! You deserve it . Do it up right in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] New ##ly re ##mo ##del ##ed rooms are very luxurious and comfortable . As with most A ##cco ##r hotels , the service is excellent . The location is a bit far from downtown , but great if shopping is high on your list of things to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located right in the downtown , easy access to all nearby business and restaurants . Would recommended for the stay or business activities es ##p you can fully enjoy downtown without being stuck in Chicago traffic . The missing star is the price - with all the convenience I believe the hotel is very p ##ric ##y ( four digits price per night for a king bed room ) . I just stayed at Fair ##mont Seattle a month ago the price there was about one third . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location of hotel is great - easy access to public transport and within walking distance of many venues and great restaurants . I ' ve returned several times when in Chicago . But , the best thing about the property is the people who work there . They really go out of their way to help , make you feel comfortable and remember you . In addition , for the electronic ##ally connected world - there are so many charging ports , outlets , and the internet actually functions ! What a joy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are planning a trip to Chicago , this could be the hotel for you . With an au ##the ##nic " Old Chicago " gangster history , this is an amazing hotel . Great newly renovated accommodation ##s . Super clean . Friendly staff and nice quiet bar area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ki ##nz ##ie for a Bachelor Party . The rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable . The staff was great - friendly and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Manager ' s reception was enjoyable , not overly crowded , and Josh took care of everyone in a time ##ly manner and with a lot of humor . The River North location is perfect for stay in Chicago with plenty to do within walking distance . I plan on staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was beyond exceptional and room was amazing . The only issue we had was getting our car from v ##alet during check ##out . Other than that the room and facilities were exceptionally clean and the food at restaurant was great . Staff was extremely friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and we did not want to leave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed with a group of friends and this hotel suited our needs . It was an easy walk to the river , the Lake and the CB ##D . The reception staff were welcoming and helpful with assisting with tourist advice . Our room was comfortable , good bathroom and free w ##if ##i . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary drinks and ni ##bble ##s on the 6th floor was a nice touch , but be caution ##ed about the house cocktail which was pre ##mi ##xed and poured from a j ##ug . I felt sleepy afterwards ! Breakfast was self help from a b ##uff ##et in the lobby by the lift and take back to the room . Us ##ual processed packet sort of food with di ##sp ##osa ##ble tools . However one morning there was none ! There was no notice of alternative , but went to the next floor and helped ourselves from there . No dining room , and no late bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] i am blown away ! We arrived and someone immediately greeted us . A few minute wait to check in ( it was the Chicago Marathon so it was packed ) - The lobby has a bar , water , beautiful . Check in was great , super friendly woman . My room wasn ' t ready , they text when you when it is . Bell desk very close . The room is spacious , booked the River view and it was amazing ! The best view I ' ve ever seen ! The bed is com ##fy , and even a small fridge ! Room service food was pretty gross . . . but that ' s my only complaint . The location is wonderful , walking distance to Michigan Ave , shops , a du ##nk ##in don ##ut right next door and right by the city walk . I will never NO ##T stay here . Is it price ##y ? Y ##ES . . . but compared to other places i ' ve stayed , the view and service was worth it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s - Bart ##ender was great - good personality Con ##s - Restaurant Coffee - Make the coffee to go in the morning more approach ##able - coffee is easy and has great margins - present it better and have fresh coffee available . It just wasn ' t easy to find / order / and didn ' t taste well . Bell Des ##k - waited almost 10 minutes to retrieve my golf clubs at bell desk , asked a front desk agent ( 1 of 2 ) who was not assisting anyone - he didn ##t bother to walk the 10 - 15 ft . to assist us with getting our golf clubs . . . then go to guest bathroom , only to find the bell desk guy in the guest area bathroom , taking a p ##oop . So we had to wait 10 minutes for our golf bags while the bell ##man was taking a crap in the guest bathroom . Everything else was just ok . Probably not a great representation of the Fair ##mont brand [SEP]
0	[CLS] The service at this hotel is superb , best in class , I have never stayed anywhere where everyone was so at ##ten ##tive to your needs . The location is ideal Everyone is very service oriented and with a smile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I did not like how there was very little surface area to lay out my toilet ##ries in the bathroom . The bathroom barely had space just around the sink to lay out my facial cleaner ##s , tooth ##pas ##te , hair brush and lot ##ions . Had to place items ( i . e . , co ##sm ##etic bag ) on the floor and on top of toilet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location ! It is on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile so there are plenty of places to eat and shop all in walking distance . Star ##bu ##cks on site is a bonus . Staff was professional and helpful from the time you get out of the cab to the time you leave . Room ##s are nice but a little tight to move around in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent stay at Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal hotel . The location of the hotel is perfect , right on the magnificent mile , surrounded by shopping stores and restaurants . Very court ##eous staff and comfortable rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was there for my anniversary with my husband and miss Kay [UNK] she was very patient and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble she even showed us how to catch the bus and the train how to download U ##ber app on her phone but while waiting in line she had a very very nasty guest in front of her and what got me the most was she continue to smile and be professional and polite to the guest even though they were jerk ##s Miss Kay is the greatest of all time . Mr & Mrs Happy Guest [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful weekend in advance of New Year . Actually extended our stay an extra night to enjoy Michigan Ave and all the city of Chicago has to offer . The 67 ##6 Bar was a romantic get ##away spot with excellent snack ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk people are wonderful . Overall staff was good and at ##ten ##tive . P ##ric ##ing @ the " pop up " bar was E ##X ##P ##EN ##SI ##VE . ( Glass of cab s ##v ##g , was $ 22 . Almost returned it ! ) Bed ##ding was good but the hallway ##s need a make ##over even though they were probably painted recently with the name change . Most locals still call it the P ##U ##BL ##IC H ##O ##US ##E . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , easy access to all sites and restaurants . A ##ble to attend White Sox game with easy access to the subway . Close to shopping , across from Nord ##strom ' s and Bloom ##ing ##dale ' s , Trade ##r Joe ' s , many other locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in a great location . Right in the middle of everything , all in walking distance . All of the staff were so helpful and friendly . The rooms were so big for a city centre hotel . Nice leisure club too with a pool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the river front location and there is this Front Office lady ( Suzanne if I remembered correctly ) who knew we were visiting Chicago for the first time , offered us a compliment ##ary breakfast and a She ##rato ##n chocolate ##s . That was so welcoming for visitors who came from over 9 , 000 miles away from Singapore . Well done , Suzanne . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located within walking distance near Millennium Park , the river , shopping , & dining . Great walking adventure w / Chicago ' s 3 levels of streets . Hotel has easy access to P ##ed ##way , Chicago ' s underground city with food options & shopping that connects the buildings & streets at least 5 blocks radius to escape winter chill ##y breeze ##s . Great meeting space for reception . Great views of the city . Room is spacious & nice . Bed ' s comfortable . Nice bathroom w / amenities . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at the Chicago Hilton several times over the past 20 years or so . It ’ s a hotel built in the grand style of the early 1900 ’ s , but mostly updated for today . The location is great , located on Michigan Ave . , not far from the magnificent mile , the museums , downtown , and also fairly close to the McCormick Center . Room ##s are comfortable , several have two bathroom ##s , which is nice . Service has always been very good . Bar ##s are fine , Kitty O ’ Shea ’ s has good beer selection . Restaurant is good , a bit price ##y , plus there are so many other great restaurants in Chicago close by why bother . It ’ s a pretty good deal for the price ; I would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just returned home from the Big ##T ##en tournament in Chicago . A friend had booked his room here , so I did as well . Very class ##y , bout ##ique feel hotel . Small ##er , but just right . Staff were very friendly . Room was awesome ! Only suggestion would be to have a few bottles of water in the room , as there is no ice or beverages . The parking is a shock at $ 58 a day , but I understand that ' s the norm . Would definitely come back . Great location also . Will look for Kim ##pton hotels in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at numerous Fair ##mont locations and this is by far the worst . It does not deserve to be called a Fair ##mont . The room is very dirty and dated . The paint is chip ##ping , mold on the shower head and the bed frames are ta ##ttered and ripped . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for one night . Check out wasn ’ t till noon so we had time to eat breakfast and do the 360 Chicago O ##bs ##er ##vation Deck before checking out . Location is great . We walked everywhere . Wen ##t to Millennium Park , Ma ##gg ##iano ’ s for dinner , Ma ##g Mile . The hotel was clean , comfortable and central ##ly located . Staff very friendly . Would highly recommend a stay there . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Always a nice place to stay . Great location on the north end of the Loop , as almost everything downtown is easily accessible . En ##ga ##ging , helpful staff that is always pleasant and professional . I have stayed here numerous times over the last couple of decades and i have never been disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with a girlfriend for her bachelor ##ette for the weekend . This is a q ##ua ##int , ch ##ic hotel . The food was also delicious ! We had phenomena ##l service all around . D ##wayne our bell ##man was amazing , so friendly and went out of his way to help us . The rest of the staff was also great . I also hosted a party in the Gallery Room and worked with L ##yn ##sey . She was hands down one of THE best catering managers I ’ ve ever worked with . She went out of her way to make everything special ! Thank you Talbot ##t Hotel for a wonderful stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the rooms ! Best ever ! The old Conrad location was more convenient for me , but this location is worth the walk . Great v ##ibe ! Would highly recommend The Conrad for anyone looking for a great hotel with great service in the Wind ##y City . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was fantastic with a great view . The location of the Fair ##mont is perfect and plenty of shopping and sights ##ee ##ing all around . 5 minute walk to " The Bean " . Immaculate amenities with a great gym and spa area . Overall hotel is very large with restaurants in and near by . Would recommend a quick weekend get ##away here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] J ##aw - dropping lobby and fantastic location near the C ##IB ##C theatre in downtown Chicago . That being said , the hotel reminds me of New York hotels , all fancy on the outside and beyond basic on the inside . At least the room was clean , the floor quiet and the bed comfortable . Managing expectations is key ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was easy to find . Staff was fast , Friendly and efficient . . Food was excellent . . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions were very clean and Check our was a snap . . . Our room had an AM ##A ##Z ##ING view . . I would definitely recommend . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great central location even in freezing weather it was easy to get to art institute and lake . lots of shops and convenience stores nearby . Hip and historic bedroom seemed rather dated although very com ##fy bed . Great breakfast and helpful staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our room and the at ##ten ##tive staff . We received an upgrade to a beautiful park view room . They also brought up a little birthday treat to our room , which was a sweet surprise . Our only disappointment was that we were only staying one night ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just okay . Un ##friend ##ly staff , could hear everything through the walls , and you have to sign - up to the loyalty program gain internet access in your room . The blanket wasn ’ t warm enough and the bed was not that comfortable . I would recommend staying elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] never clean floors never clean carpet i am still at the hotel - this is the third night for me every day i ask re ##ci ##ption to send house ##keeping to clean carpet and floor on the studio - i always hear apologize sorry for that studio not cleaned i hear sorry for that - no manager at this hotel - the entrance also very dirty with bad s ##mel - the bath not clean - dust every where i even have ale ##rgy from dust if i fight nobody will hear me - staff is not helpful ##l at all in this hotel should ranked as no star - i wonder how it is managed by hilt ##on - i ##am owner of big travel agency i travel ##l the world never find property managed by hilt ##on with this dirt ##eni ##es [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my second stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel and I ' m so happy that we stayed there again ! The staff was great ; they were friendly and at ##ten ##tive . I enjoyed the smiling and helpful bell ##man , Jeremy and Ra ##fi . Our suite was beautiful and extremely comfortable . I loved the modern de ##cor of the rooms and the hotel . They do a nice complementary continental breakfast on each floor . The location was great and we were able to walk to nearby restaurants and lots of shopping ! I liked that the hotel was smaller and I felt like the staff got to know me a little . . . . they even remembered that I went to She ##dd A ##qua ##rium and asked about it when I returned later in the day ! ! I will definitely stay at Ki ##nz ##ie again and I highly recommend it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed getting out sight seeing in Millennium park and the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le of shopping on Michigan Ave , but we loved that our day started with a cup of coffee or ended with a dessert or a cocktail in the calm open lounge area of our hotel . We walked a lot and this hotel was central ##ly located to a lot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Hotel Monaco for Lea ##p Day weekend . Location was perfect , walking distance to Miracle Mile , Navy P ##eer and Millennium Park . Hotel has a nice little bar with drinks my date loved , very f ##oo - f ##oo . Should be able to book on Price ##line for $ 80 - $ 150 / night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] very nice & recently re ##mo ##lded hotel in downtown Chicago . Near metro and not far from Navy Pier . Our room had a bedroom & bath , plus another room that was a kitchen ##ette and living room , we enjoyed the extra space vs . a regular hotel room . We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go due to location & never even rode the metro . Hotel was clean & lovely . Hotel also offered compliment ##ary breakfast and had available special rate package that included parking when we went , th ##se two things made this hotel very attractive in the budget area . loved the location of this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here with my husband and another couple for a two nights mid - week . What a wonderful find ! This relatively small hotel is really comfortable , our room was spacious , with a ch ##ais ##e by the window and the bathroom even had double shower heads . Love ##d the token ##s we were given for a free drink and app ##eti ##zers for happy hour - food was delicious ! Free breakfast - cereal ##s , past ##ries , fruit , yo ##gh ##urt are placed by the lifts on each floor and there is even a tray provided for you in the room to help carry it all . Location is central , easy to find and staff were very helpful . I would highly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice friendly old hotel , a little f ##ray ##ed around the edges but a close to amenities comfortable place to stay for a few days in Chicago . Extreme ##ly com ##fy beds ! We took the open top bus tour - brilliant ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was here for a work trip . Really enjoyed the hotel . Staff was friendly and helpful . Hotel was very well cared for and very clean . Would stay again for work or pleasure . Close to everything but 1 street off of Michigan Ave so nice and quiet . Ask for a " River View " room [SEP]
1	[CLS] The M ##K is located in the Near North neighborhood across from the Drake Hotel around the corner from the top of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile high end shops . Area itself not too interesting but walk ##able to everywhere else . Hotel was nice , certainly old , rooms themselves were clean and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Tu ##b stopped up , rats running around outside door . Un ##friend ##ly staff . Un ##com ##fort ##able bed . P ##ull out blanket was filthy . I will not be staying again . ! ! ! ! & price did not match the price on the booking . com website [SEP]
1	[CLS] First night I didn ' t get checked in until 6 pm . They more than made up for it the 2nd night by up ##grading me to a massive room with private balcony . The staff is wonderful and will do anything possible to make your experience a plea ##su ##rable experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed as part of a business meeting and found the facilities and staff to be very helpful and very friendly . When my shuttle to the airport did not show up , the Bell ##man stepped up quickly to get me a cab so that I wouldn ' t miss my flight . Would definitely stay at this hotel again - - great location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had to stay an extra night in Chicago due to the weather and moved from another hotel to this one due to over ##book ##ing . The Kim ##pton was one I was not familiar with but the one bedroom suite I had was very spacious , clean and was convenient ##ly located . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had the pleasure of staying at The Talbot ##t hotel for a couple of days in Chicago . First of all I would like to speak about Perry , he gave us the best restaurants in town , and bars ! Mark ##ed our agenda in a great way ! He was always kind and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble every time we saw him and made the Talbot ##t our home for a couple of days and made us feel so special . De ##fin ##ite ##ly going back to the hotel because of their warm & professional personnel . It was definitely a pleasure ! Also R ##ox ##ana Baxter suggestions were great for us ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Where do I start ? I spoke with Erica the day before I arrived , she was exceptional and had the best customer service . When we arrived in the room it was spectacular . Erica left a Birthday Card with treats ! ! The view was amazing . The location is perfect ! The bed was heavenly . Fat ##hy , at the front desk was awesome . He gave me a few birthday treats also : ) Michael at v ##alet was hi ##lar ##ious . Thank you Erica , Fat ##hy and Michael a wonderful experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel is great , walking distance to soldier field , Millennium Park , museums , etc . . The staff were super friendly and knowledge ##able on restaurants , things to do and see , etc . . My one complaint is the dog friendly aspect , first off , they placed us in a room right off the elevator when we were traveling with 3 dogs , secondly , the rooms are not dog / sound proof , the entire night you could hear people outside on the streets , hear people in the hallway and sometimes even hear your neighbors . If you are traveling with a dog ( s ) I would suggest using another hotel . If you aren ' t traveling with a dog ( s ) you might want to request a room not near someone who is as you might hear the dog barking , etc . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon arrival , I was made aware that they had overs ##old the reservations , and I had no room for the night . As a member of their " inner crowd " , known as SP ##G , I was expecting some help . Manager on duty had a extremely used corporate response . I was given a conference room with a co ##d . No towels , no pillows , must ##y smell , worn out furniture . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ing lack of commitment towards doing the right thing . Must avoid this hotel , in favor of an establishment that cater ##s to its clients . After 25 years of traveling for conferences , this was clearly the worse experience . Don ' t let it happen to you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always love this hotel . The pool is really beautiful and the service is great . They even g ##rac ##iously moved us to a different room ( we wanted more windows ) . The bathroom needed a little T ##LC , but overall , the hotel and rooms are very clean . Will be staying here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first visit to Chicago , and I have to say I was not disappointed . The people of Chicago who I had the pleasure to meet was very friendly and helpful . My wife and I walked most of our way around the most of the attractions . The bars and restaurants was good value for money , the breakfast run every morning was great , as we looked for somewhere every morning . We started the day on a very large breakfast which lasted most of the day . I will be returning to this great state , and visit other attractions which we failed to see . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay was nice but avoid getting rooms too close to the elevators . It is too noise and annoying not allowing a proper sleep rest . Restaurant at East side was very good . Good food and good customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for three nights following a trip to DC and booked standard rooms , ours was on the 8th floor . Service was great from check in to check out , bar staff and door ##men , particularly Craig , he was great ! Room was comfortable enough , and had a mini bar and all amenities you ' d expect ! No complaints and a good location ! Would certainly stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] A really great friendly staff , a very neat old building as the Hotel Monaco . The rooms are decorated s ##wan ##ky and s ##ty ##lish . The hotel is moderately priced . It is located in very convenient location with access to Michigan a ##ve and every else Downtown . We will definitely return to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed at this hotel , great great location just off miracle mile , if your a shop ##ah ##olic then this is a great hotel for you , rooms are great bed is so ##oo comfortable if you love flu ##ffy marsh ##mal ##low sleeping on a cloud type of bed [UNK] staff are friendly and like I say slap bang in the middle of all the shops along Michigan avenue , no room service at this hotel however your never too far from somewhere great to eat . Cloud gate " the bean " is about 20 - 30 min ##s walk straight along Michigan a ##ve . T ##h ##x for a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms , service , food and general am ##bie ##nce and caring is first class and I highly recommend . I was there for a business event and it ran incredibly smoothly in regards the breaks and food delivery and how they inter ##twined with the course . . , All the staff were very friendly . . . beyond expectations [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the hotel most recently for the Black ##hawks Convention . You can tell how good a hotel ' s service is when they have a very large group in house . The hotel staff was all top notch and on top of their game . But , the hotel itself needs a renovation quick ! My room felt out ##dated and that was mostly due to the carpet ##ing . It was severely worn and had a smell to it . Besides that , everything else was great ! Their gym is a leg ##it fitness center with a ton of equipment and weights . The swimming pool is large with , I believe , two hot tub ##s . Overall , this is a good place to stay if you ' re looking for a night out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited for 3 nights , hotel is very nice , clean and modern . Great service also . Room was quite small but nice . Only fault not much storage space or drawers . Only a short walk from the main area . Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a long weekend in Chicago and stayed at the Talbot ##t . . Great room at very reasonable rate . Love ##d the location . Was very accessible for walking to a lot of the sites to see in the city . Would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to spend some time in the Wind ##y City . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Rough first night . Too close to alley and trash cans banging . The desk staff moved me the next day . CO ##MP ##LE ##TE ##L ##Y new experience . This is a great hotel . WA ##Y better than the big chains where my colleagues stayed . If you want bout ##ique and super cool stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very close to many tourist sites , restaurants and shops . Also was very convenient to my work as well as train stops making it easy to get around . Park ##ing is expensive , so being near the train makes traveling to and from the airport was cheap and easy . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My 1st time to this comfortable and relaxing hotel to receive training and information about advocacy . The team really showed hospitality and the service was E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##T ! I would definitely recommend this space for future conventions or conferences . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel for fun romantic get ##away and birthday celebration . Unfortunately our child fell ill at home and we were unable to complete our stay . The manager would not work with us whatsoever . Have stayed here several times before but will find somewhere else to patron ##ize in the future . Love staying in River North , but fortunate ##ly there are numerous other options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First trip to Chicago , and stayed at So ##fit ##el ! Love ##d it . Great location . Wonderful staff . Lu ##x ##uri ##ous beds . Within walking distance of all the shops and great restaurants ! Will definitely stay there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The only reason I didn ' t give this hotel 5 stars is that they don ' t have any type of continental breakfast for business travelers . I had an 8 a . m . meeting and don ' t have time to sit in a restaurant for breakfast . So , this hotel didn ' t meet the needs of a business travelers . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions were very nice otherwise . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here last year , and it ' s still excellent choice in downtown Chicago . They have wonderful eve receptions , pretty fair morning breakfast and internet all included . Very court ##eous staff and perfect location . At ##e dinner across the street at Harry Carr ##y ' s . Nothing but good things to say about the place . Will definitely stay there again next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Host ##ing a friend from out of state for a concert , we had a 2 night booking at Hotel Monaco . I was surprised we got such an amazing rate of $ 135 a night from Price ##line for a Friday and Saturday stay at a Kim ##pton . The lobby was large and s ##ty ##lish , really welcoming . Staff were amazing . Wine hour great as always successful . The room was on the 11th floor , and very large 2 queen with a nice area for desk and couch . The the ##rm ##ost ##at wasn ' t working upon arrival and they sent someone up immediately to fix it . The door staff were helpful with neighborhood tips and generally every person we met that worked there made our days better . Would absolutely go back . Will be hard to find anything as nice for the price in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the Ambassador Hotel is a really nice bout ##ique hotel , near the lake front , beaches , , parks , shopping and restaurants . the service is good but could be better . we had wall plug ##s that were too loose , the number on the hotel room was a closet and the air conditioning controls were across the room from the air condition ##er , confusing . I would definitely stay here again and give the hotel an extra star , if they would fix these annoying things or at least advice the guests . all in all a winner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were clean , nicely decorated and spacious . Room service was pro ##mpt and the food was hot , the drinks cold . The flour ##less chocolate cake was del ##ish ! Wonderful views of the lake , Michigan Avenue to Soldier Field and a great city night life view from one of our rooms . Hotel restaurant provided great service and a good menu . Overall a wonderful experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband & I had another great stay here . We upgraded to a room on a higher floor which gave us a super view of the river . The staff is friendly & always helpful . Our " warm wool ##en mit ##tens " surprise was very ta ##sty , thank you ! And we love the afternoon wine tasting . This is definitely our Chicago hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed here while I was in Chicago for work last month . The staff was less than helpful when I had water issues in my room , and refused to give me a new room because the only rooms available were upgrades , which they won ' t give away for free . I ' m very disappointed with my stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is very over ##p ##rice ##d and you don ' t get what you pay for . I had to stay here for business , and although it has a great view , I would have much rather stayed elsewhere . Some of the key components that need help : house ##keeping in ##com ##pet ##ence , lack of clean ##liness in the fitness facility , room up ##ke ##ep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I held a two day planning meeting at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . The rooms were new and well done . Cold Breakfast is included at each floor and you get a cocktail each night . The meeting room was top rate . Since they do not have a restaurant , the food is brought over from Harry Carr ##ey ' s across the street and is very expensive . ( ~ $ 34 for lunch ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff ! The room was spot ##less ! It is close to many sought - after retailers , all within walking distance . Chicago is certainly a beautiful city and this hotel made the trip perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was in good location rooms small but clean elevators took too long but all together fine . Ask bell hop before you do con ##cier ##ge as they apparently know more . would recommend this hotel to any in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] The facility and the entire staff were 1st class . We did not speak to any staff member who was not helpful or court ##eous . They went above your request without being prompted . The staff would be rated a 15 on a scale of 1 - 10 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##pen ##sive but good . The hotel is a perfect option to run the ch ##ica ##go marathon . Well located , very big , nice k ##j ##sk ##f ##j ##s ##ñ ##k ##ds ##k ##ds ##k ##d ##ña ##ks ##ñ ##da ##j ##s ##d ##ñ ##ks ##aj ##d ##ñ ##ka ##j ##s ##d ##ñ ##ka ##j ##s ##D ##Ñ ##KA ##J ##d ##ñ ##k ##l ##ja ##K ##Ñ ##LS ##J ##D ##Ñ ##K ##L ##J ##AS ##D ##K ##Ñ ##L ##J ##SA ##K ##D ##J ##S ##Ñ ##A ##K ##LD ##J ##Ñ ##KA ##S ##J ##D ##Ñ ##SA ##K ##J ##D ##Ñ ##KS ##J [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed in the junior suite and it was incredible . The suite was spacious and provided a view of the city that was wonderful . I will definitely stay here again . The hotel is located in a great location with several dining options available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] W ##if ##i could have been better for the lower floors of our conference . I am not really sure how this could be re ##med ##ied as the amount of concrete and steel to penetrate is large . It also may have been my device . There were others that had marginal ##ly better success compared to me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed myself ! The rooms are co ##zy with a stove top ! I love it bathroom ##s are nice the beds are comfortable and the view is great ! Looking forward to coming back as soon as I can ! Didn ’ t make it to breakfast the comfortable bed had us out of it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were well maintained and the service was very good . Excellent location with many points of interest near by that can can be reached by walking . Me ##als and beverages at the hotel were over ##p ##rice ##d . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A lot of other places to stay in downtown Chicago . They will nickel and dim ##e you where they can on room upgrades , in room refrigerator ##s , accidentally bump ##ing an item in the mini bar . The hotel cater ##s to business travelers and not families . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel with superb check in and room amenities . Location was excellent for shopping add ##ict ##s like me . Breakfast was fantastic and you sit down and inform the staff of what you need instead of going around b ##uff ##et style . Love the comfort of the room . 2 outstanding mention - Patty and Diana were great from the moment we check in . . will definitely come back and stay longer in summer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price , the TV can be HD and it is just ok . Room a little bit small , good bathroom . We don ' t need a screen on the desk only to push advertising and ask money to surf the web . Clean and a good bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel well situated in the heart of Chicago along the river which was a unique experience to see the river freeze during - 50 temperatures . Staff very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting for extended business stay and hotel was co ##zy while avoiding the cold . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Time on Ma ##g Mile The staff was very at ##ten ##tive and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . On a call to the hotel before I came , I casually mentioned that it was my birthday celebration and if possible , I ’ d prefer two beds . They said no problem . To my surprise , There were beautiful balloons , a stuffed animal , delicious ch ##oc ##ala ##te candy and a so ##uff ##lé , bottle ##d water and glasses and a wonderful card personally signed by many of the staff ! Who does that ? ! ! ! I was so personally touched ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came for a quick weekend get ##away and cash ##ed in some H ##ya ##tt points for the stay . For a large hotel , the public spaces are pretty cool and the bar food was far better than expected . First room was on the south side of the east tower and had a view of , well , the north side of the adjacent apartment building . Front desk accommodate ##d a switch and what big differences that made . Friendly staff and good facilities . Would recommend it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] There are times when a couple used to certain bed space gets placed in a very uncomfortable situation trying to make do of con ##st ##ricted accommodation , this was my main issue with this hotel . My hotel profile was for a king bed and that did not happen during this stay . I might sound very trivial in this case and i acknowledge that , but during the night , my wife was telling me she was not able to sleep comfortable for fear she would fall out off the bed . Given that situation the staff during check in did not as much try to satisfy our request for a certain bed type but rather gave me the standard " sorry we cannot accommodate your request " and dryly i might add . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am a suck ##er for art - de ##co styling , so I immediately liked the way the entrance and lobby looked . The king room wasn ' t huge , but relatively spacious for a standard downtown Chicago hotel room . Bed was com ##fy and the room was clean with a nice bathroom . It was also a plus that even though the mini - fridge was stock ##ed , it wasn ' t sensor - based , so I could take stuff out and put my own food and beverages in . They have a manager ' s reception as well , but I didn ' t go . Everyone I encountered was court ##eous and professional . If I had one grip ##e , it would be that it seemed like elevators were really slow , or they could have used one or two more of them . Otherwise , everything else was great for even just a quick overnight and I would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A well located , f ##abulous place to stay especially with children in Chicago . Having a suite with kitchen is a plus . Me ##als included is great per ##k . The pool is on top floor ( indoor ) with windows all around to see the city . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 3 nights recently and were extremely pleased . We are Honors members and the total park and stay rate was about $ 900 ( tax in ##c ) . Considering overnight parking alone was $ 59 per night , this is a very good deal . We had a two room king premium suite which was spacious and well appointed with a comfortable bed . The hotel is in an excellent location and within easy walking distance of many popular sites . Good restaurants and shopping nearby were p ##lent ##iful . Would definitely stay here again when back in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suite was not ready until about 7 ##pm but desk person was great . The premium suite with snack ##s was very nice . The pool was clean and well maintained . The locations is great - - near everything - - shopping , restaurants . . . . . . . . . Had a great view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ask ##ed for a lake view room - see attached photo . The building is very old and was undoubtedly something great back in its day , but the public areas could stand to be updated a bit more . The location near parks , amusement , restaurants , and lake is awesome . My room was very clean and appeared to have been updated in the recent past . The convenience store prices were outrage ##s over $ 10 for a 1 Li ##ter water and banana . Foods served during 3 day conference me ##dio ##cre . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful , g ##rac ##ious , and comfortable . This hotel is in a great part of Chicago , within walking distance of many shops and restaurants . The staff is friendly and helpful . Their restaurant , des Architects , is also very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location with superb service and accommodation ##s all with a distinctly European influence and am ##bian ##ce . All this in a good way you . You won ’ t regret staying at this ups ##cale property . Whether walking or using mass transit this is where you will want to be . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Facility has been re ##face ##d , but still old building with flaws in design . El ##eva ##tor congestion is during peak times is horrible . Breakfast area is under ##si ##zed for hotel capacity . Security is a concern with the v ##alet service having doors propped open most of the time with many times where attendant ##s were not present . They have time turning the hotel rooms in a time ##ly manner as well . Stay ##ed on 17th floor , and the noise pollution was the worst I have had with any stay in any city that I have ever stayed downtown in . I do not recommend this hotel . Find another adjacent Hilton property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very large hotel right on the river with amazing views . Close to many hotels and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . They had 5 conventions going on while I was there , but never felt too crowded , just busy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , friendly and helpful staff . Very clean rooms and throughout hotel . The hotel made our trip to the wind ##y city much more enjoyable . We would highly recommend this place to anyone who is thinking of spending time in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came into town for the Lake ##S ##hak ##e Festival at North ##erly Island . The hotel is located about 2 . 5 - 3 miles north . It was a bit further than we wanted to stay but ultimately a perfect location . Nice walk ##able area . There were two adults and two teens and we ended up walking back at the end of the night . As for the hotel , many eating places nearby . The room was spacious and clean , and looked very recently updated . There was plenty of room for all 4 females in the room area and the bathroom . We had breakfast the next day and it was very good . Price ##s were good and plenty of food . I ' d definitely recommend no matter where you are planning on going in the downtown area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here many times in the past and it ’ s been an okay experience . But not this past time . Bad bad customer service and the manager didn ’ t care at all . Will not stay here ever again ( and I ’ ve been a Hilton honors member for years ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] Perfect location on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! Close to everything . Hotel staff were friendly and at ##ten ##tive and very professional . The rooms were spacious and clean and had everything we needed . I will only stay at this hotel for future visits . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a sister ' s stay ##cation . It was a perfect spot for a little get ##away in the heart of the city . Easy to walk to all the local attractions . The rooms were beautiful and clean . The staff was helpful and friendly , going out of their way to help us during the stay . Overall a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a business conference for 3 nights . The bed was extremely comfortable but I felt the rooms were small especially the bathroom . Very nice bathroom toilet ##ries . The bar inside the hotel had great ups ##cale pub food and great cocktail ##s as well . The conference rooms needed to be updated and some of the bathroom ##s on the 7th floor didn ’ t have AC and the wall ##paper was starting to p ##eel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel because the conference that I attended was held here . I was surprised that with the cost of the room ( $ 300 plus a night ) it was not nice ##r . The room really was just a standard room . We wanted to see the water so we paid a little extra but really all we saw was the top of the roof of the hotel at a lower level and way off - approximately 1 / 2 mile we could see Navy Pier and some water . The water pressure was great and the beds were extremely comfortable . All snack ##s have sensors to track if you use them , so don ' t pick them up and make sure to look at your bill so that you don ' t pay for something that you did not eat or drink . We at at Shu ##la ' s which is the restaurant in the hotel . It had good drinks and food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was helpful and friendly . The Con ##cier ##ge was excellent , helping with boat tour arrangements . The staff in the coffee shop was a bit rude . S ##pent 4 nights and it was ex ##tre ##m ##ly noisy , making it difficult to sleep . Location was good and shuttle bus service was provided to and from the event location with few problems . Did not park a car but noticed there was an extra fee for that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a couple of nights and it was a great location for seeing what Chicago had to offer . It was very close to the lake and other attractions . We had the b ##uff ##et breakfast which was $ 20 and it had a good selection of hot and cold food . This is another hotel I would glad ##ly stay in again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m a H ##H member and almost always stay at a Hilton . There is a level of quality and service I have come to expect . I simply wasn ' t impressed ( especially for the price ) . It is a beautiful hotel and the location is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my second stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker and , once again , I was impressed with the staff of the hotel and the room itself . The location is amazing ( Water Tower , John Hancock , Museum of Contemporary Art are but a few of the destinations within walking distance ) and the staff are very re ##sp ##ons ##ive and at ##ten ##tive to guests needs . Craig ( hotel manager ) and Joanne ( house ##keeping ) were incredibly professional , kind and efficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So we are staying here during 4th of July ! Super nice clean hotel . But what made our trip was Sharon Ha ##rms . Sweet girl . Super knowledge ##able . She gave us so many recommendations ! Great restaurants and places to visit . We really enjoyed speaking with her and getting to know this city . Great stand out employee . She made our trip so comfortable and fun . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad is an exclusive , luxury hotel nestled on a quiet street steps away from exciting shopping , restaurants , and the best night ##life . You can also reach the theater district with a short walk , Additionally , the rooms were well appointed with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever experienced . ( I travel about 120 nights per year ; so the reference point is good . ) Also - an amazing bathroom with good lighting ! I did not use the rest ##au ##ra ##unts , but the bar was super ch ##ic and they gave everyone a free taste of b ##our ##bon . Hilton did a good thing by rid ##ding themselves of the old stuffed suit Conrad in Chicago and making this one . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed here . Beautiful de ##cor ! Room was com ##fy . Read the reviews about thin walls . B ##rough ##t a box fan and had no problems . They also have fans you can use if you forget yours . Bar is price ##y but drinks were delicious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Start ##ed bad at registration . Vale ##t staff s ##co ##lded me for driving my car under the canopy to check in and then not using their wildly over ##p ##rice ##d v ##alet service . Regis ##tration staff tried to down ##grade my room s ##co ##lding me for using their computer check in process . Restaurant ##s are cafeteria food , low quality and prepared like a cheap b ##uff ##et . Dr ##ink ##s expensive and cheap house alcohol unless you specify , be prepared to pay more for everything you ask for . Room refrigerator 25 dollars extra . Early check in , 25 dollars extra . This hotel was not always like this . I have been staying at this hotel for 40 years when I visit Chicago , but I have spent my last dim ##e here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything is so close . My favorite was the whole foods & L ##y ##fe kitchen ! Lots of good food near by to choose from . The shopping was amazing every store you can imagine within 10 minutes . Hotel staff all very nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Beautiful hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was visiting Chicago for a concert and shopping . It was a great trip ! I love the location of The Talbot ##t - near shopping and great restaurants . Travel to the concert was easy . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and lovely room . I liked the city parking garage across the street . Bath ##room lighting needs to be added around the mirror for better lighting it is too dark and shadowy for makeup application . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is always a great hotel , but also a tremendous bargain at $ 120 a night . We decided it was cheaper to fly , and not have to pay the $ 80 a night v ##alet parking fee . Be sure to check the v ##alet fees in advance ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second time staying at this hotel . The stay itself was not bad , room was relatively cleaner as compared to the last time . They charged my card separately for parking even though I had paid for park and stay package when I made online reservation . After four or five phone calls to the hotel and an email to Hilton corporate office I was able to get the re ##fu ##nd . They gave me the reason that there was some g ##lit ##ch in their system . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is a very expensive hotel . Ex ##pect to pay for ever ##thing - $ 67 / day parking , I had to pay $ 23 for a coffee machine in my room , and the free internet is extremely slow and doesn ' t work properly ' til 12 : 00 O ' C ##L ##OC ##K MI ##D ##NI ##G ##HT [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small size , but well appointed and functional rooms . Quality and service oriented staff . Located within walking distance of many Chicago attractions and convenient to L . My only complaint is that hotel ' maid staff was del ##in ##quent in replacing soap and s ##ham ##po ##o after it was used . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for 5 nights and my colleague in another room did the same ( not cheap hotel ) . no free w ##if ##i which is already not good , the last day when we asked for late check out ( instead of 1 ##pm 4 pm ) I was asked $ 75 extra , my colleague was asked for $ 50 extra for same request . Is only money important ? we travel to Chicago 2 - 3 times year , but won ' t come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very central ##ly located , especially for the theaters in Chicago , but practically anything in the Loop is within walking distance . I personally liked the art de ##co theme . The happy hour at 5 was a nice touch and something I had never experienced in any other I ##H ##G hotel . Everyone on staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The room had a nice bed and television , and it was very clean . The only down ##side to this hotel is that the rooms are small and bathroom space is practically non - exist ##ent . I would take that trade off any day for all the positive ##s I described . The rate seemed almost too good to be true for the location , but it turned out to be a wonderful stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a worth ##while treat to include the Gold Lounge Service . Staff were very eager to offer their help . We met as strangers and left as friends after a 10 day stay . Con ##cier ##ge offered excellent suggestions and handled our arrangements for us so we could simply enjoy our vacation . Whether a break from the conference , or retiring from a busy day taking in the sites , the lounge offered a nice resting stop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband surprised me for our anniversary by booking a great room , with flowers and chocolate ##s to be delivered to our room ( in which he also called the number for the hotel to verify as well ) . When we arrived we did not get either . We were told that the She ##rato ##n online Book ##ing and telephone service are not their company . SE ##RI ##O ##US ##L ##Y ? ? ! ! My husband explained that he called the number listed on the website and he was still told by the re ##c ##ption desk that it isn ##t associates with them . We will NE ##VE ##R stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful old , class ##y hotel . Fantastic location with attached Star ##bu ##cks and a very good Restaurant " 321 " . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend . I ##dea ##lly would give it 4 . 5 stars with the only fl ##aw being the small rooms . Close to subway for Blue Line to airport . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hu ##bby and I headed to the city from the b ##ur ##bs for a quick overnight and were beyond pleasant ##ly surprised with this hotel . From being greeted by an incredibly friendly door ##man to the sea ##m ##less and friendly check in / check out , the service was exceptional . The hotel was beautifully decorated - luxurious - and just down ##right nice . In the morning we ate a delicious breakfast and was again served by an incredibly friendly server . Overall , we were 100 % satisfied with our stay and will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago since it was part of the hotel / flight comb ##o . Couldn ' t have turned out any better . The hotel was in a great location . Walking distance from bars and restaurants including bars and restaurants inside the hotel too . The hop on / hop off bus stop is located across the street from the hotel . Also great if you plan on touring the city . The Navy Pier is also at walking distance from the hotel . The hotel itself is beautiful and very clean . The rooms were big and comfortable . The view was amazing from the top floors . The hotel con ##cier ##ge staff were pleasant to deal with and court ##eous . Overall a great experience here . High ##ly recommend this hotel and location for a weekend get ##away in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a nice room in the H ##ya ##tt on the 33rd floor . Hotel is located convenient ##ly in Downtown Chicago . The room was clean but the lighting situation in the room was poor with only a few lamps in the corners of the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well appointed hotel - throughout the lobby and rooms . Great location for business or leisure . This is definitely one of the nice ##r bout ##ique hotels in the area . The restaurant is trend ##y and the bar area is very nice as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My girlfriend ##s and I come to Chicago every year and sometimes twice a year ! We AL ##WA ##Y ##S stay at the Monaco ! The service is un ##par ##alle ##led ! This is a bout ##ique style hotel ( more intimate than your larger hotels ) , the same staff is there every year and they remember us ! ! They have compliment ##ary bikes you can ride to the river ! The rooms have just been renovated and are awesome ! They have delicious fruit In ##fused water in the lobby ! Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary coffee and wine hour ! Very clean , and just flat out perfect ! Great convenient location overlooking the river ! Super close to Star ##bu ##cks and Mill ##eni ##um Park ( the bean ) and Wild ##berry Cafe ( best breakfast in the city ) ! Ron , Thomas , and our bell ##man ( see p ##ic ) went AB ##O ##VE and beyond to make our stay perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dark and sexy ! Co ##m ##fort ##able beds and smaller rooms . The restaurant and bar are still not open which was a total b ##um ##mer . Park ##ing is very expensive so park across the street in the garage . The lock the door at 11 so you have to call to get back in the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice location . Room ##s nicely appointed with look ##out ledge over the river . Great touches for the kids like personal ##ized robes . Use the hotel bicycle to get around . Con ##cier ##ge really helpful with directions around town . Make sure you come back for evening wine hour and meet other guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was in June for my daughter ' s graduation from college . We had nine rooms blocked for family members here and the experience was wonderful . We loved the bar downstairs , and the rooms were lovely with very comfortable beds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has been recently re ##mo ##del ##ed . The view of the city was beautiful ! Less than a block from the red line and walking distance from Michigan Ave . and restaurants . Co ##mple ##mentary breakfast and light evening meals served with beer and wine Monday through Thursday ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago is beautiful . The hotel staff were friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and truly seemed to enjoy their jobs . Everything is clean and I ’ m in love with the floor to ceiling windows . This really helped to make my first Chicago visit memorable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent an overnight in the Hotel All ##egro . It is a very nice bout ##ique style hotel . It is very close to Christ ##kind ##le Market and all the theaters . We visited the Christmas market and took in the production of Wicked . Even though it was winter , we never had more than a 3 - 4 block walk . The staff is very welcoming and I will return here next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3 day stay at this hotel for my wife and I , and the service was second to none . I ’ d like to thank the team at the gold lounge : Mu ##gi , Tiffany , Man ##dan ##a and others , for making our stay so perfect . You guys were there to answer our questions before we had a chance to ask ! Wow - Sea ##m ##less . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in a suite overlooking the river ##walk . The room was great with plenty of space and amenities . The air conditioning kept up with the 92 degree heat outside . The bell desk and parking attend ##ents were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Things were great ; the view was wonderful ; the room was lovely . Service was excellent . Two small things : 1 ) There were two of us and there was only one robe ; 2 ) The maid knocked and came in without waiting for a response . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel itself was lovely ! Although they didn ' t have my reservation that I had made from Hotels . com back in January of 2015 . This doesn ' t seem to be a fault of Hotel Monaco , rather from Hotels . com . However , the staff at the Hotel Monaco was able to get me and my friend into a room that night ( they were sold out of the room type I had reserved ) and assured me that I would not be charged as I was fully charged by Hotels . com at the time of my reservation back in January . The hotel is in a perfect location on the Chicago River and central to many restaurants , bars , sites , etc . They even have a daily happy hour in the lobby where they serve up delicious wines . And the staff was super friendly and very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have been coming here for 10 years and always feel welcome . Love the de ##cor , the location and the lobby restaurant is fantastic . Can ' t think of any aspect that was less than satisfying . Have stayed in several other Chicago hotels but love this one above all others . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our weekend in Chicago was made all the more special because of the exceptional service from the staff at the Conrad ! We checked in early on a Friday , and stored our bags , as our rooms weren ’ t ready ( but at 8 : 30 AM , we didn ’ t expect them to be ) , while we headed to breakfast and to do some shopping ! As promised , we got a text promptly when our room were ready , and arrived back at the hotel to find our bags already delivered to our rooms ! The rooms were large and very comfortable , with every possible am ##eni ##ty . And the staff even arranged for warm compliment ##ary cookies and milk to celebrate our daughters ’ birthday ##s ! The hotel location is f ##abulous , and we will DE ##FI ##NI ##TE ##L ##Y stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel with a great location , very customer focused with comfortable / quiet rooms . Room ##s were appointed nicely , elevators fast and plenty of them to service at high capacity days and beds comfortable . Note : at the restaurant that serves breakfast they bring around a bread tray that they don ’ t tell you about . I ordered an $ 8 bag ##el not knowing I could get a free c ##rois ##san ##t [UNK] or other type of bread . Another note : if you choose not to have your room cleaned you get a $ 10 credit but it ’ s only towards food and be ##v . I thought in room movies included b ##c I was told that by a staff member but in the end it was not . T ##ip ##s are also not included in the credit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I were lucky enough to find this g ##em of a hotel while traveling through the mid west . Not only was the staff super friendly , but they take pet friend ##liness to an extreme level . The bout ##ique finishes are great ! ! ! Love the window seats ! ! ! The hotel can provide food dishes and pet beds for your fur ##ry friend . We were traveling with our dog and he loved it . The pet agreement is super cute too . . . it had a place for a p ##aw print . You won ’ t be disappointed with your . . . I will warn you , Chicago parking is steep . . . we had to pay $ 60 a day to park at the hotel [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was just at the hotel parking my car and Will came to my door with a huge smile and greeted me . It was very busy but he didn ' t rush me at all and I had a lot things to get out of my car . He helped me and was so patient . I will always park there when I ' m in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is everything for this property . I have to say I would select it again for that alone . The room product is dated , dull and must ##y smelling . Change ##d room 3 times to get the one with the least offensive smell . I understand it is a large property but it ' s time to put some money into the room product . The food product is excellent from room service to bar / restaurant . We ordered room service twice during our stay and both time had the pleasure of speaking with Jill . The second time we called , she was such a bright light on the other end of line . Ask ##ed how our stay was going and if we were enjoying the weather . She elevated the service for our stay . Thanks Jill ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a very nice clean place to rest your tired body . But the staff is what makes the stay memorable . The front desk people : Paige , Leah and Dev ##a were very helpful and very friendly . I also want to mention the two con ##cier ##ges ( sorry guys I didn ’ t get your names ) were very knowledge ##able and helpful . These are the people that make your stay memorable and to have the desire to want to return to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Obviously well trained staff was consistently host - like welcoming and g ##rac ##ious and exceptional ##lly Well - trained staff consistently welcoming and g ##rac ##ious and very pro ##active in anti ##ci ##pating needs . Bring swim ##sui ##t as iconic , huge indoor pool is a true “ take me back in time ” experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We found this hotel to be a great fit for our family . The staff was top notch ! Craig was very helpful from the minute we arrived until we left . He is very funny too ! Ser ##inge was also a big help getting us our car whenever we needed it . We will definitely plan to stay here on our next trip in a few months . Of all of the many hotels I have stayed in along the Ma ##g Mile I found this to be my favorite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Restaurant , v ##alet , and mini ##bar currently closed due to co ##vid 19 . But room was well cleaned on arrival , hotel is in central downtown location with great restaurants and shops within minutes of hotel . Mini ##bar items are available for purchase in the lobby and hotel is very quiet . Have zero complaints about hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] A group of girlfriend ##s heading into the city for a one - night get away and the hotel provided everything we were expecting and more . The location is perfect for shopping , access to great restaurants , spa ##s and really everything the city has to offer . The rooms are spacious , modern and clean . The continental breakfast is out of this world with a full spread on every floor . I ' d highly recommend the Ki ##nz ##ie to my friends , work colleagues and will definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing place , great location in the heart of the Ma ##g Mile . Staff is extremely court ##eous and rooms are beautiful . There is so much thought and detail to ensure your stay is what you hoped for . You can not go wrong with The Conrad ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] El ##egan ##t without being pre ##ten ##ti ##ous . This hotel is very efficient but the staff are warm and friendly . I have never seen such efficient turn ##around of a conference venue from one event to the next . Excellent . I don ##t know what the public facilities are like if one is not part of a conference group . The room was extremely comfortable with excellent house ##keeping . Location just great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is dated and not all the rooms have upgraded TV ##s to allow for Netflix , etc . but the service by folks like John the Door ##man and Bart ##ek more than makes up for the modern aesthetics this property lacks ! John and Bart ##ek are fantastic and made us feel like royalty ! Would stay here again just because of them ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recent stays with She ##rato ##n in Toronto and Salt Lake were very disappointing , and so I was app ##re ##hen ##sive when I learned that a conference that I attend was being held at a She ##rato ##n . No need ! Service was excellent . The facility was lovely . The house ##keeping staff were met ##ic ##ulous . And , the staging of the conference was very well done ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed there again this year because our experience last year was so good . The quality of room and customer service continues to be excellent . The view of the downtown from the room is wonderful . The complementary breakfast and dinner is not only great to eat but the staff make it an enjoyable social experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice despite its age and the food at the conference was excellent . The hotel staff were all extremely friendly . The bed was exceptionally comfortable . The bathroom with a separate tub and shower was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] very central hotel , close to the underground train station , and only streets away from the main shopping area . most of the staff were very helpful , but there ##s always one or two that lets the side down ( maybe it was an off day , we all have them ) . the social event in the evening was a great touch would def ##inate ##ly stay here again if were ever lucky enough to stay in ch ##ica ##go again [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed twice as a stay ##cation - New Year ’ s Eve & later in January because we enjoy the hotel , location , service , and amenities . As well as the staff being very pro ##active to see if anything was needed , they also reacted when we needed assistance . Especially on New Year ’ s Eve when it is crazy busy we appreciated the attention and help . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a wonderful hotel ! Excellent location that ’ s close to everything . Friendly staff , imp ##ec ##ca ##ble service . My second stay at a Conrad property . Can ’ t say enough good things about Conrad Chicago . T ##ruly a 5 star experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great accommodation ##s and perfectly located downtown . Great views from our rooms on the 16th & 20th floors . Check in was fast when though it was a very busy weekend . Several weddings and the Chicago Marathon were going on and yet service was great . Nice places to sit and visit with guests in the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel team is great . Room was clean , everything working . Local ##ization very good . Hotel Restaurant is very good is Michael Jordan ` s G ##ri ##ill . Something to consider is if you purchase goods and ask to be delivered at your room there might be a Fed ##ex fee from US $ 5 to US $ 25 depending on the size . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Una ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and call ##ous customer service ( aside from the front desk staff ) ; I would not stay here again . For the price , you can stay in just as a great of a location and pay a similar or lesser amount any ##how . They say w ##if ##i is free , but it ' s not , you pay a service charge like 10 % of your room fee for the w ##if ##i and gym services . Um , that ' s ridiculous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was friendly and upgraded my room for my family . The staff was helpful and very professional . We ordered food and drinks in the lounge and received time ##ly service . The staff provided good instructions on where the parking garage was at ##l [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good Hotel , a bit on the Mid - high range but it ' s understand ##able considering the location of it . The annoying for me in 2018 is having to pay around 10 / 20 $ for W ##IF ##I when you already are paying 200 + for a room . Other than that , Hotel was very good [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie is convenient ##ly located at State Street and Ki ##nz ##ie , which is the first street north of the river . It has an elegant but relaxed lobby area , nicely decorated rooms with comfortable seating and bed , and court ##eous staff . Un ##ique to most Chicago hotels is their manager ' s reception held each evening where guests receive a compliment ##ary glass of wine and where delicious app ##eti ##zers are served . In the morning , the Ki ##nz ##ie out ##do ##es itself by serving a complete continental breakfast on each floor ! They even provide a tray in your room to carry breakfast back to your room . This is indeed one of my favorite places to stay while in Chicago and is perfect whether travelling for business or pleasure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a very comfortable hotel . The staff went out of the way to be sure we were comfortable . One day house ##keeping missed our room , so they came that evening . They also worked around my work schedule since I was working in the room . Great bed ##ding . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were very impressed with The Ki ##nz ##ie ! High ##ly recommended if you ’ re looking for a good value , central ##ly located stay in Chicago . The staff were also incredibly helpful and friendly . We ’ d happily head there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here for a conference . First , the hotel has very little ' sit down and chat ' space ( chairs , tables , etc ) especially compared to conference hotels near by . Second , however , the hotel and service were great . We definitely felt a personal touch . The room was a bit dated , but clean , com ##fy , and had nice views . We want to make sure to compliment the Con ##cier ##ge , Bernard . He was extremely helpful , thoughtful , and had great suggestions . He was a pleasure to work with . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is just not a great Conrad hotel . The front door bell service was non - exist ##ant on arrival and departure . The rooms are very functional over enjoyable . Food in the restaurant was poor . H ##H ##ono ##rs diamond benefits of room upgrade and late check out didn ' t work . Even the premium internet was difficult to use . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quick check - in very friendly staff . Our suite was perfect . Clean , warm ( - 5 degrees and snow ##ing the night we stayed ) and well equipped . We enjoyed the breakfast , especially the blue ##berries for the pan ##cakes . The hotel is 1 block from Michigan Ave and the area has many restaurants and shopping , something for everyone in our family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this hotel several times and have consistently had a good experience . The lobby is large so even if there are lines of people checking in , you don ' t feel crowded or overwhelmed . Our rooms usually face the river and are spacious and clean . There are several amenities in walking distance ( architectural boat tour , River walk , Whole Foods ) . We were pleasant ##ly surprised to find that the bar has a large selection of wine ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is fine . Nothing more . There was apparently a conference or large group at the hotel during my stay . Check in / out was under ##sta ##ffed and needles ##s ##ly in ##ef ##ficient . The con ##cier ##ge staff , while pleasant , is likely being compensate ##d to make certain restaurant recommendations , as the one they made to us turned out to be ho ##rre ##ndo ##us in a city full of spectacular dining choices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were assigned to an AD ##A room since at check in . The handle that controlled the shower head leaked all over the floor . Stay away from room 1921 East Tower . However , the hotel overall was nice and a great location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location just off Michigan Avenue . Beautiful , newly re ##mo ##del ##ed rooms . Great hot breakfast , all day coffee and evening reception is a full dinner ! Love ##ly 6th floor lobby . Pool and work out room both just enough . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was outstanding . Upon arrival the v ##alet and check in was the fastest ever . Our room with a view was very clean and quiet . The con ##cier ##ge gave us great rest ##ara ##unts for sea ##food and Italian . The bartender was very friendly . The front desk was efficient . I would give this place an excellent rating for everything . Will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly hotel with a fantastic central location on the Ma ##g Mile . All suites which is nice , but the rooms are showing their age . All clean but it is now of an age that really needs a complete re ##furbishment ( not just red ##ec ##ora ##ting ) . The bathroom in particular was quite old fashioned . The swimming pool was a disappointment , very small . But had a nice hot tub . Very friendly staff . I had mentioned on check - in it was a special anniversary for us ( I was trying to get a cheap upgrade ! ) , but there were no upgraded rooms available - we were shocked the next day to have a bottle of b ##ub ##bly , a cake and hand ##written note con ##gra ##tu ##lating us . Very nice touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful am ##bian ##ce in lobby for compliment ##ary prose ##co each evening , which also created a fun opportunity to social ##ize with other travelers ! Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful . Great location with lots of very nice restaurants within walking distance . Only negative was that our room was very small but still an exceptional value . High ##ly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have had the pleasure of staying at Fair ##mont hotels all over Canada and the States and I must say this hotel doesn ' t not live up to the Fair ##mont ' s high standards of quality and service . The rooms and furniture are worn out and in need of a re ##f ##resh . St ##aine ##d carpet ##s and walls . Tor ##n chairs and stained couch ##es . Mini bar fridge that doesn ' t work . I stayed 6 days in a suite and had to call down to have the s ##ham ##po ##o bottles replaced . The only positive note is the Gold Floor & room service staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here recently and was happy with the facilities . Hotel is just off magnificent mile and central to bus and subway . Staff are friendly and engaging . Small but well equipped gym if that ' s your scene . Would definitely return [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the hotel which is close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and Nord ##sto ##ms . Have a room with a separate bedroom and living area - i . e . not living in the bedroom . The separate k ##ig ##tch ##ete allows having some meals in - house . Spa ##cious rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel location is very good . The have good options for drinks near to the f ##ron desk . Good cost benefit but the hotel has old rooms and is not so con ##fort ##able as we were expecting . Clean ##ing was so far so good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a dental conference for my job and it was amazing . The breakfast was a little expensive but it was worth it . They had security at the elevators after a certain our which made me feel safe . They host a lot of event but you do not here it on the hotel room levels . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Hotel does everything right in my eyes . I was supposed to be here for a romantic weekend , but it ended up being a solo trip . Even if you were on a solo business trip , this place does it right with p ##amp ##ering and making comfort part of their regular le ##xi ##con . The location is definitely in an area where you can get access to a variety of restaurants , shopping , and bars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cha ##rming historic hotel with modern services and amenities . Staff are professional and court ##eous . Room ##s are comfortable and clean . Lots of character . It is good to just sit in the lobby and enjoy a re ##f ##resh ##ment . Good central ##ly located close to amenities and tourist attractions [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located at the perfect location . The rooms are big , clean and beautiful . The manager , Travis , is very kind and made me and my friends feel very welcome straight away . He makes sure you have the best experience possible in Chicago . I would highly re ##com ##ment this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about the place was comfortable , welcoming , and fun . The door ##men were fantastic and felt like friends we ’ ve always known . They couldn ’ t have helped us any better . D ##wayne and Charley were their names and they are true ambassador ##s for the city and The Talbot ##t . Jane at the front desk was also superb . I ’ ve never stayed anywhere where the staff was better . I highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly room very spacious and well appointed . It is one of the " older " buildings in Chicago with a nice entrance and lobby / bar area . Staff were very helpful and know ##led ##gable . Location is great just a few steps away from Michigan Avenue near Rush Street and fashionable restaurants / bars , a knockout hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was clean and nicely updated . The elevators are very tiny and antique but work fine , sort of a 1920 ' s feel . The front desk was very small and tucked in a back corner . It stated that there was a charge for internet but while we were there they said they were switching to a new internet service and that we would be able to use the w ##if ##i free of charge . Its not a grand ##ios ##e hotel but it was clean , updated while keeping some of the old charm and certainly met our needs . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our first stay at the O ##m ##ni was delight ##ful . The whole package - the beautiful suite at such a good price which included breakfast and parking , was very satisfying . The door ##men work so hard to give you a welcoming , caring experience . We will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love it . The poll was great . The gym . Front desk staff was wonderful . I did have to wait for too long . Would be nice to have more light in the room but it ’ s a very nice quiet hotel . I ’ m planning to stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed at your hotel several times over the last few years . We always had a nice time . This time we were visiting for our anniversary with plans for drinks at the " tower " bar and St ##ets ##on for a nice steak dinner , but our hearts dropped when we found out both were closed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always stay at a Kim ##pton when we can . I love the Monaco the best . The location is great and the rooms are the largest . Love the window seats ! Staff is great , South Water Restaurant is good and always helpful . Great coffee in the morning and free wine in the afternoon . Mostly clean comfortable rooms ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is always an excellent choice to stay at . The staff are professional and friendly , rooms are very nice and you ’ ll be guaranteed a good night sleep in their com ##fy beds . The location can ’ t be beat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was in a great location with exceptional service and beautiful city views . We loved the rooms . The fitness center was fantastic with very nice equipment . The restaurants on ##site are all top notch ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the Chicago Hilton , and will probably stay again . It ' s a great location , and the hospitality can ' t be beat . The rooms are clean and the self park / AAA option works well for us . We move a college student in and out twice a year , so we bring our car . You don ' t have to wait for a v ##alet to get your car . B ##UT the rooms are in need of an overhaul . The bathroom ##s are cramped and have poor ventilation . There aren ' t enough electrical outlets . The de ##cor is d ##rab and d ##rea ##ry . [SEP]
0	[CLS] the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker helped make our Chicago experience great . The staff were so friendly and knowledge ##able and the location was perfect for the downtown experience we were seeking . I would glad ##ly stay there again when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our first encounter was with our bell ##man and he was very friendly and kind . He loaded up the cart and brought it right up to the room and helped us un ##load it . Check ##ing in was a breeze and we got a beautiful corner suite overlooking the amazing city in 2 directions . I also want to compliment the spa staff . I had one of the best facial ##s ever . Also , if you are looking for a hotel within walking distance of the river and Millennium Park , then this is the perfect hotel . We parked the car at a lot right around the corner , and it was 1 / 2 the price of the v ##alet . We never needed it because we were able to walk everywhere . Also , try Miller ##s Pub right next door to Palmer House . Hu ##ge selection of beer and great R ##uben sandwiches . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay and walking distance to all you need . I would definitely stay here again . It has has a wonderful fitness center . You are walking distance to attractions and great restaurants . There ' s a great breakfast site around the corner , Wild ##berry [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for three days and found it was a very good location . The red line stopped a block away which offers easy access to all the other lanes . Hotel if ##fer ##ed a great breakfast to start our day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed on the Gold floor , and our room was very nice . Extreme ##ly spacious . The hotel is located a stone ’ s throw from several Museums and parks , and our room had a lovely view of the lake . The service in the lounge was decent , and we were especially fond of Pat ##ric ##io who was very kind and at ##ten ##tive . My only real disappointment was that I had specifically stated that I was ve ##gan when we made our reservation , but no accommodation ##s were made . Also , the choice of food in the lounge quite limited compared to other Fair ##mont ##s we have stayed at . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was lucky enough to get an amazing room here , with spectacular views . But the best part was actually the check - in , where Chris and Ke ##enan made my whole day . I ' m so impressed with the staff I ' ll surely be back . My room is on the 10th floor and has a view of the sky ##line and the lake , including the f ##er ##ris wheel at Navy Pier . I don ' t normally stay at large corporate hotels , but it just happened to work out this way . I thought it would be a one and done deal , but the quality of the room and the friend ##liness of the staff are enough to make it my first choice in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel location is great . A couple of blocks from the John Hancock building from which you can get the best views from the city from the top . It ’ s also a few blocks from Lake Michigan and half a block from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ( great shopping and restaurants ) . The hotel is a bit out ##dated but it ’ s charming . The staff is great , super friendly and eager to please . We tried the restaurant downstairs for breakfast and it was rather good . The room has a mini bar you can empty and fill with your store bought beverages . Across the street ( inside the Drake hotel ) there is a mini convenience store although their prices are high but W ##al ##green ##s is about 4 blocks away on Michigan Ave . Overall we had a good time here and will come back when we visit Chicago over the summer . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Just got back from a girls trip to Chicago . Hotel Monaco was a great place to stay . The room were very clean and spacious . All the staff from the front desk to the luggage attendant were really helpful and friendly . You felt very welcomed . They do offer a happy hour , with wine . In the morning they have co ##ffe and tea is available in the lobby , if you want co ##ffe in your room you have to request to have coffee maker to be delivered . The location is so handy to many act ##iv ##ites , yet very quiet when you are in your room . I will remember staff here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great spot next to Grant Park . Didn ' t care for the memory foam mat ##rre ##ss , fees for luggage storage . Some of the meeting facilities are old and g ##rung ##y . The room was nice enough and clean . Service was good . The old building is cool and elegant . Trade ##offs here for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best location , walking distance to all hot spots in downtown Chicago . Friendly staff and nice restaurant with good food , nice bar ! ! ! We had the best room for the price , river and lake view ! ! ! Car garage on the side , you can book separately and save some bucks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The family and I spent 4 days at the O ##m ##ni Chicago over this past Memorial Day weekend and loved it . The location is simply fantastic and the rooms were really quite nice with the small living area separated from the bedroom . We arrived Friday morning hoping to store our suitcase for the day only for them to tell us us we could go ahead and check in . This was a really pleasant surprise . I understand that this is not always possible but we really appreciated it none the less . I don ' t have anything negative to say about our stay . All of our staff interactions were pleasant and any issues we had resolved almost immediately . We would definitely stay at the O ##m ##ni again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was here for a conference with a little personal time . The hotel is in a great location , is well maintained and the staff are extremely helpful and at ##ten ##tive . Up ##graded to the Gold Lounge and have to say it was well worth it to have the access to coffee , beverages snack ##s and small meals . Man ##dan ##a in the Gold Lounge was very helpful , kind and friendly . Will visit again for sure . Will have to say that the only disappointment was the w ##if ##i service - not very good at all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 2 n ##d visit this time with family . Good location , nice rooms . But this Hotel has the best Con ##cier ##ge E ##VE ##R . They make the best restaurant recommendations that are not full of tourists . High ##ly recommend Peter who sent us to the best places [SEP]
1	[CLS] People are awesome . Bar is pretty good . The con ##cier ##ges were out of this world . Location is pretty good , at the end of the golden mile . Nice stores and coffee places near by . If you want to walk so ##wn Michigan a ##ve is a good place to start . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We celebrated my Birthday in Chicago this year . Intercontinental was in a wonderful location , spot ##lessly clean , comfortable and we had a lovely room . They have a friendly and helpful staff who were always asking how they could help . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Anyone staying at this hotel must go to the con ##cier ##ge to pick up an i ##P ##od tour and fact sheet concerning this hotel ’ s history . You will be so glad you did . From the original 12th floor pool when swimming was a s ##pectator sport to the amazing ball rooms and hidden historical Masonic symbols . This hotel was built in 1928 and was called the Medina ##h Athletic Club . The market crash in 1929 caused the Shrine to lose the facility 4 years later . Great staff and nice comfortable rooms especially in the executive tower . The only draw back is they do not have a club lounge . For an inter ##continent ##al Hotel of this size and status , they desperately need a club lounge . Otherwise , great hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Just returned home from a weekend at the Monaco Chicago . I would suggest for anyone visiting Chicago to stay here . The Mediterranean Suite was fantastic . The service was wonderful . The location is perfect for walking to restaurants , shopping , and the river walk is right outside the door . Love ##d the unique de ##cor in the room . En ##joy ##ed cocktail ##s in the evening at the hotel restaurant . Everything was just lovely . Thanks Hotel Monaco for making my Christmas shopping weekend " perfect " . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The accommodation ##s for my son ’ s wedding weekend were fantastic ! What an amazing hotel ! Beautiful ! The wedding suite was so perfect . The location is also ideal and convenient . We had a large group staying at the hotel for the wedding and everyone loved the experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room is standard size but well equipped . Nice lines and clear all around . Large safe is great for a large laptop . Light ##ing is average , could be better . Pa ##id for access to the lounge on the 15th floor , for a nice breakfast and other treats during the day . Lounge staff are very friendly . Sharon was exceptional , always willing to serve . Jesus and the others also nice . G ##ym is small , crowded , and not well equipped , but some basic machines are present . Food served to our group was sub - standard . Do not eat there . Tax ##is always available and the Bell guys are very helpful . Alto ##get ##her , a nice experience , with lounge service being the highlight . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is the grand ##e Dame of Chicago hotels but it has stayed up with the times . Deep in the heart of downtown , magnificent lobby , well appointed with great places to eat . Lots of elevators , lots of help . On the other hand the rooms tend to the small and sometimes the wall ##paper isn ' t attached to the wall . We enjoyed our stay and will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed for a weekend away . Ph ##eno ##men ##al physical product ( our room was im ##ma ##culate — thank you house ##keeping ) , but the service really ups the ant ##e compared to hotels nearby . Can ’ t say enough about the friendly front desk staff . Even the engineer we ran into in the hall was polite and kind . This will be our new go - to hotel whenever visiting Chicago . Extra bonus : Free drink token for a beverage in their lounge every night of your stay . Yes please ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in Chicago for a girl ' s shopping trip . We enjoyed our overnight stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . Great location and super friendly staff . They happily stored our luggage while we shop ##ped all day after check out . Park ##ing was 69 . 00 , but were able to leave the car until 5 : 00 pm after checking out . Great experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a great location . The rooms are nicely furnished and clean . Very quiet because it is an older building , Staff was nice and helpful , The con ##cier ##ge could have been nice ##r but he was probably just having a bad day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed on a Chicago Fire ##works night and had a fireworks view room . We were so happy and impressed ! Sa ##t on our com ##fy chairs and watched the action on the river and the lake and the amazing fireworks . Super com ##fy bed . Great location within walking distance to Navy Pier . Excellent check ##in and luggage storage service . So central . We will be back and we will stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay was sea ##m ##less from start to finish . The hotel was in great shape , staff was kind , and operations ran smoothly and without a hit ##ch . Fair ##mont has once again proven that they are the best of the best ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Within walking distance to Michigan Avenue and River Walk . Con ##cier ##ge service , especially Peter , is really most helpful , with expert advice for everything . Room is spacious and clean with nice toilet ##ries . The gym is good , with range of facilities and compliment ##ary apples . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have been visiting Chicago for 5 days , and we choose to stay at Monaco Hotel . This hotel is just perfectly located , right close to the river , close to the lake , and in the center of all attractions . We were able to walk almost everywhere . Quiet , comfortable and very welcoming staff . A 5 to 6 happy hour , a glass of wine were offered in the lobby . Nice idea ! I would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay here . We had to check in early and although our room was not ready yet , we were able to leave or luggage while we went sight seeing . The cost of the hotel was very reasonable and it was within walking distance and the red lines . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff ##ing at restaurants was poor . Room was complete with amenities . Not enough coffee etc . What coffee was there was horrible tasting . I was there for a convention / conference . The bar , and restaurants were under staffed . The bed needed the mattress rotated , or replaced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I researched hotels and the best area to stay in . This was the best location - Michigan Avenue , River , restaurants , near lake and Pier one ! Nice hotel , service , great breakfast , etc . I would definitely stay again if we ever return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this property before and love it . The staff are very at ##ten ##tive , the rooms are gorgeous and the lobby stunning . For an older hotel , the rooms are surprisingly quiet - no hallway noise at all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This bout ##ique hotel is central ##ly located at the north end of the loop . Many places are within walking distance . The hotel has a super view of the river . Room ##s are clean and well appointed . No room service , but many local options for meal ##time including the house restaurant which serves three meals in addition to a comfortable bar / lounge . If you have questions , be sure to see Rick , the con ##cier ##ge . He does a great job as do the door ##men . The Monaco quickly became my home away from home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love bout ##ique hotels and this one is charming . Room ##s are spacious in an excellent location in the heart of downtown Chicago with tons of restaurants , bars , theaters and other tourist attractions . Staff are friendly , helpful and made feel welcome . They have a compliment ##ary wine and beer happy hour daily as well as com ##p coffee and tea . I loved my stay here and I would return if I came back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I picked this hotel because they would take my dog . Little did I realize it is even more beautiful than the pictures . And the staff couldn ' t have been nice ##r . They don ' t charge for pets AND they give you a dog ##gie bag of treats , with some p ##oop bags , some treats , a new toy ( which she loves and it reminds us of our stay ) and a list of dog friendly parks , beaches , activities and such . Very wonderful stay , although Co ##da doesn ' t like elevators or outside g ##rates , she got used to it in the three days we stayed at the Hotel Monaco . We will be back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Gene Murray was absolutely wonderful ! ! ! He went above and beyond to make our stay at the Talbot ##t the most memorable experience for my family and me . We came in for wedding dress shopping and bride ##sma ##id dresses and this trip will never be forgotten thanks to Gene and all of his accommodation ##s he made for us ! ! I always look forward staying at the Talbot ##t because we get to see Gene ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 3 nights . The rooms are very comfortable and good sized . All different configurations as it is an older building , but very nicely updated . Wine in the lobby at 5 each evening is included , as well as coffee and tea in the mornings . What really makes this place outstanding is the very friendly staff . The door ##man remembers everyone as does the front desk staff . My new favorite place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the location . Right downtown with lots shops . The only complaint I had was we arrived and paid for Vale ##t parking . I thought v ##alet parking meant they go park your car and then when you leave they bring it up to you . That was not the case . . . We had to go down in the basement and they did pack our car with luggage but we had to drive it out of the garage to head home . We were hoping the would bring our car to front hotel but not the case . So lesson learned , they take your car and park it but they do not bring it back to you in front of hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose to stay once again at the Fair ##mont because it ' s a great hotel in an ideal location next to Mill ##eni ##um Park . Lo ##bby is beautiful . Room on the 23rd floor was large , well - maintained , and had great view over Lake Michigan . Staff very helpful . Our conference was in the hotel which added to the convenience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at the Ambassador many times when it was The Public and always loved the cool ch ##ic modern v ##ibe of this historic hotel . So I was curious to see if things have changed . I had a one night stay at the Ambassador in mid July and I was greeted by Maria at the front desk . She was extremely knowledge ##able about the hotel and even told me a great story about a Taylor that used to stay there ; ) Need ##less to say Maria went above and beyond to exceed my expectations a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting my requests and arranging a fantastic room with a great view . Overall I think the hotel is even better now that it is Ambassador again . I look forward to my next trip back to Chicago and plan to stay at the Ambassador again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el is in a great location . The staff is very friendly and helpful . The room was very clean and comfortable . I stayed in Chicago a few months ago , and at that time I stayed at the Virgin Hotel which was ranked higher . I don ’ t understand how that could be as that hotel is a dump . On return trips to Chicago , I will continue to visit So ##fit ##el . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great friendly staff beautiful rooms . Good restaurants . Kid friendly and great location second stay and will stay again . So much fun for adults and kids pool great gym . Good prices Co ##m ##fort ##able beds and nice t ##v ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is probably one of the best places in Chicago . It ' s one block away from the subway ; in front , Nord ##strom and a shopping mall ; two blocks away , Michigan Avenue ; two blocks from the river , a block from great restaurants and night ##life . The room was great too . We had a small kitchen and a sitting area to gather after a long day . I would definitely come back to this hotel and recommend it to whoever asks me for advice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Two days in a row there were no wash clothes placed in my room . Each day I had to call for fresh wash clothes even after the maid service completed . Additionally , there was never an extra roll of toilet paper placed in the bathroom and had to call for that too - after running out . I stayed five days for goodness sake . Last ##ly , the elevator system is ho ##rre ##ndo ##us . The system sa ##rdi ##nes a bunch of people in one elevator while the remaining elevators are dormant . For the money I expected much better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been here numerous times for a variety of conferences and I always have a great experience . Lots space to hang out ( sky bridge and gallery lounge rock ) , great food options , convenient location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was truly disappointed with this Hotel . Despite being a I ##H ##G Platinum Member , I was not even given the option to upgrade my room . In addition to that , my request to extend the check - out time to 3 ##p . m . was decline as well with the reason of " we are running at F ##U ##LL " . . That ' s how they are treating their loyal customer . I think it ' s time to consider to clock - in more with A ##cco ##r Group Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , clean , friendly with a te ##rri ##fic elevator system . Only problem - U ##BE ##R drivers can ' t find the place . 2 out of our 4 U ##BE ##R drivers never arrived . Restaurant and bar were both very good . View from 40th floor spectacular . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very glad that I booked a room at The Talbot ##t Hotel . The room was large and we had plenty of space . We came in from the suburbs for an event and found the hotel in a great spot for shopping and restaurants . It was updated two years ago and is modern yet sophisticated . We really appreciated the compliment ##ary drink coup ##on and used it later to have a relaxing drink in the library . The door ##man D ##wayne was a special delight to have a conversation with . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was in Chicago for business , and it was a relief to come back to this hotel each evening . I ' ve decided to make it my regular Chicago hotel . It ' s very comfortable , clean , and has good amenities . It ' s in a great spot . The best is , the staff is helpful , professional , and friendly . Amir at the entry way recognized me each morning and made sure I had a cab . T ##ruly excellent staff . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The inter ##continent ##al stood up to its reputation beautiful , clean and perfectly placed . What made it stand out though was Gus at the front desk . He made us feel as if we walked into our own home . He took our stay from great to exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel near Michigan Ave shops . Vale ##t and front desk staff provided great service and even changed our room to give our family of 5 a little more space . Pool and hot tub are very small for the size of the hotel , and v ##alet parking is pretty price ##y . A little noisy overnight from the occasional sire ##ns , but great hotel overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel . The service is great - especially the waiter ##s at the breakfast . Today I missed the Philadelphia cream cheese and Jay noticed that I was looking for something special . He asked if he can help me and I told him that I was looking for this special cream cheese . A few minutes later he came back with 3 of them - he just attended it for me . And 10 minutes later my colleagues and I were surprised by 2 chocolate cakes . This absolutely made my day and i wished to have more super friendly waiter ##s like Jay in Hotels ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Chicago So ##fit ##el is perfectly located in the heart of Chicago . Amazing hotel architecture and well designed room . Sur ##rou ##nded by great shopping and restaurants , all within walking distance . Will definitely book again for next Chicago trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel for a city trip . Located in good area with easy distance to most attractions View from the 10th floor up is amazing . Either you get the city or the park Restaurant in the lobby is ok but restaurants in close proximity are better [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister got married at this hotel recently . Everything went great - from check in to the ceremony and reception . Food was delicious , service was fantastic . The event plan ##ner provided by the hotel was excellent . Only a couple knocks : first , most of the guests were able to get better room deals by booking with outside vendors ( ex . Trip Advisor ) as opposed to the room block set up by the bride and groom . Second , the elevators were as old as the hotel ( it seemed ) - they were quite small and quite slow , so it was difficult to move between floors with any sort of speed . Otherwise , great hotel for downtown Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful place to stay . Very clean & comfortable . Staff was friendly & always helpful . Great location just a couple blocks from Michigan Ave & close to an “ L ” stop . Wonderful bar & restaurant with great outdoor seating . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Spa ##cious , comfortable room with excellent beds and nice bathroom / shower . We had 2 adults & 2 grown kids and did not feel cramped at all . Perfect location close to many restaurants ( R ##PM Italian was delicious ) and Ma ##g Mile . Park ##ing nearby was easy . Great happy hour ho ##r ' do ##ur ##ves & drinks in a cool lounge . We will definitely be coming back soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best customer service . Great location . Friendly , at ##ten ##tive staff . Room ##s were im ##ma ##culate and comfortable . I was here for business , but would happily return for business or pleasure . It was great to have a Star ##bu ##cks that opened up to the lobby too . Con ##ven ##ient to shopping and a variety of restaurants . Not far from the lake ##front either . Perfect stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel really met all of our expectations . At the last minute we decided to switch hotels to a more central area and this was perfect . Easy walking distance to everything , great service at the hotel and even better price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was nice and well kept . Service was always pro ##mpt . Overall , great stay for my family and I for a weekend get ##away . Absolutely L ##O ##VE ##D Clive , who is the bell ##man outside of the hotel ! Super nice and an above and beyond helpful guy ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the views , to the old world manners , this hotel offers you an opportunity to get away from their real world and into the rare ##fied levels of service and commitment that we don ’ t see everyday . A ##cco ##r themed beds offer ##er a com ##fy du ##vet , while the views are breath ##taking . Moe in the Brass ##erie is an amazing talent for recommend ##ing dishes and is such a helpful ch ##ap . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel in a great location . Our only issue ( aside from paying for w ##if ##i ) was with the v ##alet parking . It was $ 67 / night and the 2 times we needed our car it took 25 minutes to get it . We ended up being late for the wedding we were attending . When it was time to leave for the airport , we called down early but the attendant was still standing there with my keys in his hand when I went downstairs to check on it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The best bed I ' ve ever had in my entire life ! I slept like a child ! The hotel is ex ##k ##lus ##ive also and you can reach anything what you need after work in walking distance ! For business or a city trip ! You should definitely chose So ##fit ##el in Chicago ! Close to the river for a run and a very good gym at the hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The inter ##continent ##al hotel was decorated beautiful for the weekend festivities ! The entire staff is polite , helpful and knowledge ##able with whatever question you have for them . Every one of them from the front desk , bell ##hop ##s , room service , house ##keeping where so very friendly . The rooms are clean and comfortable . We will return again to Chicago and make this our new Hotel choice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have come to O ##m ##ni Chicago for a get ##away trip for the past 21 years , and this was as f ##abulous as all the rest ! ! ! Top notch service is why we continue to choose O ##m ##ni Chicago ! We look forward to our next years . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located . I stayed here for a conference and the food was excellent , service was excellent , and room was excellent . Love that it was so close to Michigan Avenue shopping and very close to the theater . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone was friendly and helpful and it was a nice stay . I would have liked to been able to have a shuttle to / from the airport . Food was great . House ##keeping did not clean my room on the morning I chose to sleep in and didn ' t leave until 10 : 30 ##am . They were still on the floor , two doors down from my room when I left . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here a year ago on the recommendation of friends who had stayed here . It is a great hotel with a perfect location . We came back a year later for the La ##ver Cup and brought another couple with us who enjoyed this property as well . Would come again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is great . Room was big with everything you needed . Love ##ly staff and a good breakfast too . Great location right next to the Trump and in a great spot for restaurants and bars . Well done guys ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay - cat ##ion ! The location is great , right off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Ta ##sty places to eat , f ##abulous stores to shop , wonderful site ##a to see . The room was nice except the foot bench was in horrible condition - just old . It made an i ##rri ##tating sound . Report ##ed it to the front desk but nothing happened . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All around great stay . Be sure to see the con ##cier ##ge , David . He is dedicated to service and thoughtful care during your stay . All staff is kind , friendly and the hotel has a great v ##ibe . Close to so many sites ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This once super s ##ty ##lish and well oil ##ed machine is showing it ' s age , but it remains a favorite in Chicago because of it ' s size , location and style q ##uo ##tien ##t . A little ni ##p and t ##uck would bright ##en her face . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My son and I were on the ghost / gangster tour which introduced us to the Palmer House . I am a Hilton Diamond member , we were com ##ped a nice upgrade to the executive floor . My only disappointment was with the breakfast at the executive lounge breakfast . I had a much better meal at the Hampton Inn in Milwaukee . Which was surprising . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Chicago is located near numerous restaurants , shops , and public transportation , including the CT ##A Red Line . The hotel is not fancy , and one must use two elevators to get to his / her room , but the rooms are large and service is very good . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I wanted to make last minute plans for my wife ' s birthday weekend . Natalie at the front desk and Is ##hm ##ael at the front door came to my rescue . They went above and beyond to make our night a memorial one at the Ambassador Chicago . Natalie came up with the great idea and Is ##hm ##ael h ##ust ##led to the store to get the ne ##cess ##ities and returned in time ##ly fashion . Upon my departure , they personally made an effort to wish me well and to make sure if we were pleased with our stay . The Ambassador Chicago is now on top of my list when looking for a weekend get ##away . I consider it to be my hotel and will definitely recommend it to all of my associates . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a business trip where our company actually used the Fair ##mont meeting rooms . The room was very clean except for a bottle of shower soap left in the shower from the guest that had stayed there prior to me . ( It was half used but one of the hotel brands so the cleaning staff may not have noticed . ) Otherwise the room and bathroom were spacious and im ##ma ##culate ##ly clean . The service at the bars downstairs was okay but the staff wasn ' t friendly . The hotel staff itself was exceptional in their hospitality and willingness to help . The food served during lunch in our meeting room was b ##uff ##et style and was good . The location is great as you can walk to Michigan Avenue , the Navy Pier or the park within minutes . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . The rooms were very comfortable and the hotel staff was te ##rri ##fic . Craig really made us feel at home as soon as we walked in the door . And the rest of the staff was super a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . We had an issue with the TV and the safe , and they had a know ##led ##gable and nice man from engineering in our room within 5 minutes to fix both . I usually have to sleep with ear ##p ##lug ##s in when I stay at a hotel because of the noise , but I didn ' t have to at all here because it was very quiet . The location of the hotel was perfect for our purposes . We walked to Millennium Park , Navy Pier and the River , along with several other places , with ease . I wouldn ' t hesitate to stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker on my next trip to Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at Ki ##nz ##ie more than once and I always love it there ! It ' s clean , the staff is very professional and helpful . They ' re always ready to answer any questions and to accommodate the customers needs . I ' ll be back for sure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful ! There are restaurants , a cafe , and gift shops all located inside the hotel . Staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful . When I checked into my room the shower didn ' t have a shower curtain on but house keeping came promptly and put one up for us . You can hear noise from the street which was sort of a n ##ui ##sance but the hotel is definitely a prime location to stay when visiting Chicago . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There is NO pool . And if you have kids be warned , the mini ##bar that is locked for drinks and $ 40 to even store left overs in the fridge has candy and snack ##s on top . They are weighted and if they are lifted up , say by a curious and hungry kid , you can be charged ! Otherwise the room is fine and its a very nice lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful ##ly decorated in an art no ##ve ##au style . Bed ##s very comfortable . Bed ##room and public areas are spot ##lessly clean . Staff extremely helpful and friendly . Wonderful location for many of the city ' s attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is really a fine hotel : Good location ( just of Michigan Ave ) , large rooms , new d ##é ##cor , and good service . It falls short of the leading hotels in the city ( e . g . , Peninsula , Four Seasons ) : Breakfast b ##uff ##et is barely average , no turn - down service , con ##cier ##ge service not apparent . But . . . the rooms cost substantially less than the leaders , and these are pretty minor def ##ici ##encies . So while I think it would be wrong to rate the Conrad as highly as some of the other hotels , the hotel does carry a pretty big bang for the b ##uck . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I cannot say enough about the wonderful folks at Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel ! We worked with them for a wedding block for our Chicago wedding in March and everyone who we talked to was so kind and helpful . Janet handled the block , and she kept me updated with booking ##s , reminded me when I needed to book my own room for the night , and checked in afterward to make sure everything went well . She also helped my mom arrange a Sunday morning br ##unch for our guests . She is f ##abulous . Our suite was beautiful , floor to ceiling windows , and we got our wedding night com ##ped for filling up enough of our room block . I will recommend Ki ##nz ##ie to everyone we know , and would love to stay here ourselves again too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] - Good location - Nice view from the room - Although we didn ’ t have the time to use , it the pool seemed very nice on the top floor - Coffee and tea making facilities - Good kitchen u ##tens ##ils - Spa ##cious enough for 3 people - Although it was ch ##rist ##mas day and most people were leaving the hotel , we were refused a late check out - The breakfast is one of the worst I ’ ve seen - The pillows are extremely small and soft - The bed wasn ’ t as clean as one expects it to be [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for New Year ' s and I ' m sure anytime . Would have given 5 stars but the view from the room was not so great however I didn ' t ask for a change . The activity at the hotel was joy ##ful and entertaining watching the 30 and 40 ##ish generation party ##ing at a private event . However , they were very New Year ' s dressed appropriately . Great bar tender ##s and the restaurant staff crew . I would surely go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a nice hotel , located in a great area ; able to walk to everything . However , what set this place out was that every one of the staff we encountered was wonderful , from the door ##men ( yes , all of them ) to the front desk , to the restaurant / bar staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted the O ##m ##ni for a 3rd time from the UK , this is a great hotel , staff are great door staff are great . The location is perfect for everything , The rooms are massive and all have a sitting room . The rooms were cleaned every day to high standard and fresh coffee put in your room every day . We didn ’ t plan to be back in 2019 but we will definitely be back and staying at this great hotel again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for 3 nights while pre ##form ##ing an on site music job . I played for a large event in two of the main conference rooms . The hotel staff and the sound engineer were very professional in the presentation that I needed . I had a great stay , excellent food and I felt re ##f ##resh ##ed for my performance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was not ready upon arrival . We had to store our luggage , return and then we were invited to wait an extra hour at the bar for our room to be ready . No compliment ##ary drink offered . We had no view on the 2nd floor and it was very expensive . No gift shop , no coffee unless you go to the restaurant . No newspaper . Can ##t recommend this property with so many other options to choose from in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I booked a last minute get ##away to Chicago with my kids and it was wonderful . Hotel was in a great location and the staff was exceeding ##ly friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Will definitely be returning again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was great , very close to all transportation . There is a grocery store very close by that offers a large variety of wine and beer and most anything else you would need . The free breakfast was very good . The free happy hour was nice with different things every night but always a good salad and beer on tap and wine . We had a nice view from our window ( we asked to be moved because our first room had a terrible view ) . We had a great view of Trump Tower . We parked at a garage across the street because it was so much cheaper than the hotel garage ( go to spot ##her ##o . com ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in for business . The hotel has an excellent location - the middle of magnificent mile . The staff is friendly . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms including t ##v hair dry ##er and coffee machine . The fit ##nes room was well equipped . Overall a very positive experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] My fi ##an ##cé and I decided to take a quick get away to Chicago to enjoy the Black ##hawks game . That Saturday morning when looking for things to do both reception ##ists Alex and Gerry were extremely helpful . They had a number of suggestions for us to keep us busy and even assisted us with directions . They made our check out effort ##less ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve stayed here several times and would say this was the first time I was not satisfied . Staff is usually great but there seemed to be more issues with this stay than normal . Not sure I ' d stay here for family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel lobby is very spacious , full of co ##sy sofa ##s to hang out in , orange fl ##av ##our ##ed water on tap all day , and there is a scent of green tea f ##rag ##rance in the air . In the mornings you can pick up your choice of tea or coffee from the lobby before heading out for something more filling . Room ##s are quite small but quiet , and the best part is for all yoga add ##ict ##s - there is a yoga mat in every room . Be ##ware - it is also a pet - friendly hotel , so ask for a room far away from dogs or you might have a barking dog next to you . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Couldn ’ t ask for a better located hotel here in Chicago . Located right on mi ##chi ##gan a ##ve amongst great shopping and restaurants . Friendly professional staff , especially the gentlemen who work outside up front . G ##reet ##ed us every morning when we left , and every evening when we returned . They were very helpful with directions , questions , and hail ##ing a cab . The hotel could use an update , rooms felt very dated . M ##J ’ s steak ##house is a must din ##e located right in the hotel . All in all i would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . It is a great hotel with amazing staff . Love ##ly amenities and de ##cor . Most enjoyable stay with friends . Right in the centre of what ##s happening in Chicago you won ' t miss a thing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t to a conference at the H ##ya ##tt . Conference was in the basement and room was on the 28th floor . Had a fantastic view . Had a double queen room . Very large . People who worked there were ex ##tre ##m ##ley friendly . Everyone I meet had worked there 10 + years . Say ##s some ##th ##ng about the management when they keep workers there that long . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A most enjoyable experience on the executive level . Ernest Fi ##zer was the most ho ##sp ##ita ##ble host on this level ! He was persona ##ble , helpful , enjoyed meeting guests and definitely remembered names . The rooms we ’ re comfortable and well appointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I never get tired of visiting Chicago . So much to do , so many places . . . . We loved the Fair ##mont Gold , especially the personal attention of Man ##dan ##a . She made us feel very welcomed and her attention to detail was wonderful . We ' d go back in a second ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Valerie at the front desk was phenomena ##l , she met all of my needs and answered my many questions . People like her make traveling a delight . She is part of what makes this hotel second to none . Thank you ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] For my first visit to Chicago , O ##m ##ni was a good choice . Its central ##ly located in the Chicago Downtown and in a great location if shopping is on your mind . The King Suite rooms are comfortable , though I would have preferred one with a better / open view . The breakfast b ##uff ##et is a good spread and con ##fer ##encing facilities are excellent ( with a nice lunch spread ) . The room access is a bit cum ##bers ##ome as you need to got ##o a Lo ##bby / Re ##ception floor first and thereafter access elevators to the rooms . Nevertheless , a very good experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff exceeded our expectations and was one of the best hotel experiences we ever had . They made our daughter feel like she was royalty and made us feel very welcome and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Would stay here again in a heartbeat . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at this property for a Saturday night out ##ing in Chicago . It was very easy to make the reservation online and the price was great for the location . We arrived at 2 : 00 in the afternoon and unfortunately our room was not available yet . However , they advised us to head to the bar area to wait a few minutes and that the drink was on them ! ! Can ' t beat that for sure . The room so convenient ##ly located to everything that we wanted to do . The room was appointed with great bath products and was quiet during the evening while we slept . I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling to the Chicago area ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is spectacular . The entire staff is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! ! The hotel is very clean as well . We will for sure stay again next time we are in Chicago . The location of the hotel is about 4 blocks from the Navy Pier . Very close walking distance to the area . [SEP]

1	[CLS] The staff and the food in the club level lounge are phenomena ##l ! ! ! Every aspect of this 4 day trip was extraordinary - and I never left the hotel . I had the most beautiful view of the river from my room . Can ##not wait to go back and stay with my family for a tour of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , room , elevator all good . I did not have any food there . Staff were all careful to ask if they could help . Hope they get well paid . Location is excellent . I am adding more to my review because apparently I did not have enough characters . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very happy with my experience at the hotel , everyone was very friendly and welcoming from the moment that I arrived . The hotel is in an excellent location for all tourist attractions and very close to shopping area . She ##ryl in Con ##cier ##ge was very helpful in going through the different tourist options and even saved me from doing something that would have wasted a whole afternoon , which was very much appreciated . The food in the Columbus Ta ##p is excellent and very affordable and the staff are very at ##ten ##tive . The beds are very comfortable and the view from my room was fantastic . All in all , a very wonderful stay and I didn ' t want to go home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here when in town to see " Hamilton . " Can ' t beat the location if you are going to a show at the Goodman or any of the Broadway in Chicago theatres . Quiet despite downtown , and extremely comfortable beds . Room are s ##ty ##lish but tiny , and little counter space in bathroom . El ##eva ##tors very slow and since one of the three was down , they were very , very crowded ( we were on the 14th floor and realized the fastest thing to do was catch an elevator going up , then stay on it down to have a space ) . Park ##ing convenient but expensive . Outstanding hotel restaurant with excellent Italian food . Very good option for a weekend theatre visit if don ' t mind tiny room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] City was fully booked , and we were attending an event at the hotel . The staff helped us get a room and when the trip for extended a few more days the staff was super helpful and got us extended through the week ! A special shout out to Con ##cier ##ge Nicole T . For being such a huge during our stay ! I would highly recommend Swiss ##ote ##l and would 100 % stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location and adequate rooms . Got one on the 30th floor with great view . Friendly staff . Room ##s are little out ##dated . Great TV . Bath ##room , both sink , and bath ##tub had very slow drains . Need to clean a little better . Park ##ing is attached , which is a plus . Co ##sts $ 55 per day with in and out privileges . However overall was a pleasant stay , will be on our list to stay again when visiting Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I received excellent service from Kay she was very professional when I needed assistants and very nice and caring . she has an outstanding personal ##ty and very fun to talk to I most definitely will be visiting again [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at many properties in Chicago and the Intercontinental is my favorite . I like the overall am ##bie ##nce ; staff are friendly and helpful ; rooms light , comfortable and good size ; great location . I enjoy Michael Jordan ’ s bar and restaurant . Overall , it ’ s my hotel of choice for Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel , very convenient to the conference I was attending . Morning breakfast was convenient , but a bit price ##y . Star ##bu ##cks located off the lobby was very convenient for morning coffee , and a nice area to meet up with colleagues . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my second five - night stay for business . My room this time was a ta ##d bigger with more she ##lving in the bathroom to accommodate my toilet ##ries . This was a H ##U ##GE plus . Travel ##ing in the middle of winter , the rates are phenomena ##l for this beautiful hotel and loop location ! I ' m able to easily walk to and from place of business each day . The staff is always friendly and at ##ten ##tive . The accommodation ##s are above average in every way . The bed is extremely comfortable with high quality sheets . My housekeeper was excellent ( absolutely the best I ' ve had ) AN ##TI ##CI ##PA ##TI ##NG my needs . How often does that happen ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Home ##wood Suite ##s was a great Hotel in a great location . It was a little price ##y , but being in a great location inside the loop it could have been a whole lot more . The only problem I experienced is with the elevators . There were only two of them , slow and not always [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was small and un ##im ##pressive . The hallway was dirty and there was broken glass ( barely visible ) in front of our door . House ##keeping cleaned it after I called them . Food from room service to other rooms rot ##ted in the corridor for over 24 hours . The door to our toilet had the paint p ##eel ##ing off and there was a second refrigerator in a corner of our room , broken and not useful . Location good and staff friendly and helpful . Overall OK , but not up to the standard of a Hilton ( and for the price ! ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hilton location is convenient and comfortable . I have stayed her many times within the last 4 years . The bell men are extremely helpful and polite making you feel warm and welcome . Very rarely is their any issues at this hotel , however if there is they are always quick to resolve it . Room ##s have always been great , but recently they where updated and renovated to be even better [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the time of arrival until time of departure I enjoyed my stay . The staff are very friendly and court ##eous , location is great and the rooms are spacious , nice and clean . I will definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was at the She ##rato ##n for a conference and everything was great . The room was clean and attractive and the bed was especially com ##fy . . We were in Room 340 ##9 and it was very quiet . One of the best things was the amazing view from this room - I could have sat there all day and watched the lights of the city . We enjoyed the continental breakfast and the app ##eti ##zers in the early evening . The lunch ##es provided for the conference were delicious . All in all , a very good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location ##1 block from Ma ##g mile , food and transportation . Very good service from staff . Amazing winter room rate and v ##alet parking package booked directly through hotel . F ##abulous hotel charm with live pianist and active bar scene . The big problem is the room . Show ##er was chip ##ped all over with poor ca ##ul ##king ; carpet was filthy with wine stain ##s throughout carpet ; we could hear every word of guests in next room ( and they spoke at normal volume ) ; and we could SE ##E guests through gap between adjoining room door ( which means they could see and hear us ) . Una ##cc ##ept ##able . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sometimes you want your hotel stay to be effort ##less , and this is exactly what the So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile provided us . Easy reservation , easy check - in with the offer of an upgrade . Really friendly and truly welcoming staff . Clean , spacious and well appointed room . Fantastic location near everything in Chicago plus great location to the Red Line - which we used all week . We just booked another weekend 8 / 12 - 14 we liked it so much . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is getting business based on location . The rooms look old and the bathroom needed ca ##ul ##king . When calling the operator , desk for assistance , it took forever to talk to someone . I have stayed at the Intercontinental in foreign countries and those are beautiful hotels . I will never stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Front desk service was very good . 10 of us arrived an hour before allowed check in and they accommodate ##d us . Room was typical size of most large city hotel rooms . Quiet and dark though so good for sleeping . Show ##er leaked all over the bathroom floor and the rain shower head wasn ' t strong enough to remove the soap from you . Overall , the hotel was pretty enough but a little worn . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay at the Monaco frequently for work . It is a wonderful hotel and the service is always outstanding . The rooms are very comfortable and beautifully decorated . The window seats are a nice touch . Everyone who works there is at ##ten ##tive , friendly and helpful . Antonio the door ##man is particularly te ##rri ##fic . Love the per ##ks like " raid the mini - bar " and wine hour . I stay at a lot of hotels and the Chicago Monaco is far and away my favorite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for a conference , we stay in King Room with club access . The breakfast and snack time were good . The hotel is strategically located with protected drop off and access to other buildings . One minor problem , the access key didn ' t work on 2 lifts . We ' ve reported it but no action was taken until we left . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This historic hotel is a delight . The beautiful lobby alone is worth the price of the a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s . The hotel is exceptionally clean and well kept . The location is superb . This is my default hotel when I travel to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a f ##abulous hotel in a f ##abulous area where we could walk everywhere . Everyone was helpful and friendly . The only negative is you have to pay to store your luggage . This is the first time I have ever had to pay for luggage storage . This higher end hotel should not be charging for luggage storage . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very special wedding to attend in Chicago and 7 of us from out of town were attending . I booked a queen suite with an attached king . The accommodation was very nice and it all went off without a hit ##ch ( once I hooked up the kids with W ##i ##F ##i ) . I would not call the rooms luxurious by any means , but only because places like The Canyon ##s in Park City , U ##T and The May ##flower in D . C . have probably spoiled me . Easy access to The bean ( AK ##A Cloud ##gate ) , Buckingham Fountain , Michigan Ave and Navy Pier . The room was very quiet and the bed ##ding was wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After delayed flights , lost luggage , and double booked V ##RB ##O rental I was ready to get back on a plane and leave Chicago . I was able to book two rooms at the Talbot hotel were we were treated like VIP ##s the entire stay . The Talbot ##t staff was fantastic , they were able to get me into 2 rooms right away and offered complementary drinks at the bar after hearing about our awful travel . They even offered to receive my lost luggage for me so I would not have to sit and wait for it all day . The hotel was extremely clean and the serviced was excellent during my entire stay . I def ##iant ##ly will be staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] hotel is in great location downtown Chicago , staff was fantastic , room was more than I expected . Check in online is so worth it . Walk ##ed in and had room keys in about 2 minutes . High ##ly recommend this hotel [SEP]
0	[CLS] we love going to the She ##rato ##n Chicago . we usually stay there every month and Erica at the front desk is always so kind and friendly . she is amazing and that is the only reason we keep going back . This is the only hotel I would recommend to anyone . . the rooms are so comfortable and the service is top - notch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My brother and sister - in - law live right next door the Public , so over ##flow friends and family always stay here when visiting . Great location , can walk to dozens of great restaurants and shopping is off the charts . Hotel is very reasonably priced and has cool bar scene and nice rooms for the money . Will stay here again in a heartbeat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very s ##ty ##lish 1920s style hotel in a central location just 15 min walk to the " Bean " in " Millennium park " or the W ##rig ##ley building and 5 min ##s from the train to O Hare . The rooms were clean and comfortable and the toilet ##ries were really luxurious . There ' s free tea and coffee each morning in the elegant lobby and b ##ub ##by there in the evening at 5 where guests can min ##gle and chat . The only down ##side was it was a bit noisy in the mornings with people leaving and staff cleaning . The doors seem to close with a bang . We stayed 4 nights and found it to be a great s ##ty ##lish central location from which to explore Chicago . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Coffee was cold in restaurant and salad was very g ##rit ##ty . Wait ##ress never came back to check on food or offer hot coffee / re ##fill . When asked for fresh towels from front desk , it took so long that a meeting was missed because of delay in delivery . Finally got dry towels from maid in hall way . Bed was old . Sleeping di ##vo ##ts / impressions very obvious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the Kim ##pton All ##egro for a long weekend in Chicago . The hotel is elegant , but in no way pre ##ten ##ti ##ous . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and kind . Leah R . ex ##em ##plified the meaning of professional ##ism - - thank you for your help ! The rooms were small , but why would you be staying in your room all weekend ? There ' s a whole city out there ! The Star ##bu ##cks on Wells and Randolph is connected to the hotel , which is convenient and slightly dangerous if you have a coffee addiction like I do ! : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Steven the manager , was extremely professional . He accommodate ##d me when I had to change the date and he was very professional in his communications with me . It made the difference for me . The rooms were mac ##ulate and I loved the am ##bie ##nce . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love older hotels and the Hilton Chicago is one of the best . Lots of dark wood and marble with high ceilings and ornate trim . The public areas of the hotel are beautiful . Guest rooms are very nice and well done as well . I have been to this hotel several times for business meetings which included use of the Grand Ball ##roo ##om . If you stay here try to see the Grand Ball ##room and also walk around the other public areas . Well worth the time . In a city noted for great architecture this hotel fits in very well . Great location on Michigan Avenue across from the park and Lake Michigan waterfront . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over ##p ##rice ##d , un ##friend ##ly staff , excessive up ##cha ##rges at every turn , regret on this place , pool was decent , be sure to ask about parking and park somewhere else , just not what we expected , only nice per ##k was 2nd bathroom and pool [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a Business Trip to Chicago and Stay ##ed at O ##m ##ni Hotel . it was a great experience with great location . The Conference was a two days event in the Hotel and all details were cover at all levels . Conference Room ##s , food , personnel and special night event were more than satisfied . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My daughter and I stayed here and had a fantastic time ! The front desk associates were extremely nice and welcoming every time we came and went . They made a connection with my daughter that made her feel welcomed and is now asking when we get to go back to stay there : ) . Very clean and well kept . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel interior is gorgeous ! You guys did an amazing job with the renovations - Restaurant happy hour is perfect ! And Kay at the front desk welcome ##s me with a smile and makes me laugh after a long day of traveling every time ! She is fantastic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel last weekend and it is a great bout ##ique hotel in the heart of Chicago . The staff was so friendly and persona ##ble . L ##O ##VE ##D the 6th floor for Happy Hour and it was packed ! ! fun way to meet new people . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you like good service , you must go to the All ##egro ! We spent a mini - moon there after getting married . Michelle and Ruby were text ##ing us to make sure we had what we needed . While we were out , they delivered a bottle of champagne and cheese cake to our room . Everyone was great ! Room and bed was awesome . There was a bit of work going on on the exterior , but only during normal working hours . It did not effect us at all . If you are a member , you can pay ahead and get a better rate , though it is not re ##fu ##nda ##ble if your plans change . Re ##com ##men ##d ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is really good . We arrived early and were greeted with an upgraded suite that overlooked the Chicago River . The hotel was clean and the lounge was well staffed . We would definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved the location of the hotel , right in the heart of downtown , walking distance to everything . Once I arrived I was greeted by a friendly door ##man at my ride , helping me which I was grateful for . Everyone inside was just as helpful , once at the desk the service was all smiles with detailed information that I did need later . I was glad the room keys operated the elevators , that added more security for me . The room was a nice size , clean and with a view . This hotel is attached to a Star ##bu ##cks which was amazing , if you a coffee drink ##er . This hotel was definitely top notch . And I can ’ t forget it ’ s right next door to Michel Jordan ’ s steak house . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with my wife and w ##ow what an incredible hotel ! ! ! Aside from the great location , ( middle of downtown and walking distance to everything ) it has a G ##RE ##AT GA ##TS ##B ##Y feel / v ##ibes ! The lobby is beautiful ! The rooms are a little on the smaller side but i found out it is because the building was built back 1926 , which makes sense . Now , lets talk about the customer service . The staff is amazing . They are all helpful & funny at that . Sandy and B ##rig ##itte were cracking me up during my check - in process . If you need a good laugh you need to ask for these 2 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice room . People are nice . Room ##s have both tub and shower . Breakfast in the hotel is about $ 35 . You can go to tunnels in basement and eat for a lot less . The tunnels connect a lot of buildings so you can get to a lot of places without going outside . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for thanks ##gi ##ving weekend , and we were greeting with nothing but kindness the whole time . We brought along our two dogs and they were also greeted with pets and love . The hotel is in a great location ! You are minutes away from Water ##town Shopping center and Michigan Ave . They had coffee available every morning along with a full bar attached to the lobby . Perry helped us with any questions we had . The hotel was so pet friendly . There was also a park a block down to take the dogs to walk . We will be back for sure . Like I the whole staff was nothing but kind during our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont Hotel ' s location make it the perfect hotel for business and seeing the sites of Chicago . I was there for a convention that had shuttle bus service . It was nice at the end of the day to come back to my large , comfortable Fair ##mont room . Like ##s : Large room , comfortable bed , big bathroom with separate tub and shower , fast elevators , and proximity to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Only con was AC never really gets the room cool enough for my taste . The staff are friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I would definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stop looking at other hotels and stay here ! A very luxurious room with tons of space . I love having a couch and large TV as well as push button electric everything . To push " black ##out " right from bed to close the blind ##s and then open them in the morning to an amazing view . I was also very impressed with the great prices on food and beverage , especially room service . The room service does not add a delivery charge they just simply add 20 % . You also do not have to sign the check and it is all served in sort of a large bent ##o box . So creative and it arrived hot and fresh . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Yes , it is a beautiful historic hotel . The lobby is f ##abulous . On the other hand the rooms are fair at best and need maintenance . The bathroom ##s are terrible . Li ##teral ##ly no place for anything . If you sit on the toilet , your shoulder ( and I am small ) hits the toilet paper holder . One has great trouble reaching the toilet paper to use it . There is an outlet directly over the sink f ##au ##ce ##ts that should be illegal as it is in a dangerous location . I would not stay there again . I can visit the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel located in great downtown Chicago area for shopping and eating . Nice restaurant / bar on the premises . Vale ##t parking for car was convenient ( but not cheap ) . Up ##graded room was spacious , modern and comfortable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a wonderful time in Chicago at the H ##ya ##tt , the Hotel looks great with wonderful food and beverage options and great service . A great hotel to stay at in the f ##abulous Wind ##y City for business or a shopping trip ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] A wonderful experience . Made to feel welcome from the very beginning . Wonderful suite and the staff were amazing . Travel ##ed for my daughters birthday and I will definitely stay at this hotel again . Close to major shopping and sights ##ee ##ing . Great experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was there for the conference . We were fed quickly and the staff was excellent . Roberto was very friendly and helpful The rooms were clean and comfortable . The v ##alet , D ##wayne , was so helpful too . Will be back to explore the city next time and will stay with you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Si ##mp ##ly . . . luxury . En ##joy ##ed the stay at Conrad Chicago , large , very well appointed rooms where every detail is taken care of , great restaurants , especially il ta ##vo ##lino . Location very central , near several attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] i will suggest everyone who is travelling to Chicago to stay in this Hotel as this Hotel is having is Ancient , Spa ##cious , connected , great view from rooms , nice lobby , nice reception , nice people . . . am short of words for the Hotel . . . so please do stay & enjoy [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came here for the Gala . Wonderful evening ; Park ##ing was a breeze . Beautiful room pleasant seating and great waits ##ta ##ff ! Food was beautifully presented but beef file ##t was tough . Fun evening for a great cause . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed my stay . Spa ##cious room , very comfortable bed , and very at ##ten ##tive and cord ##ial service . For those who work out , there is an exceptional fitness facility . All the comfort ##s of home with a great location to see some of the cool sights of Chicago . I recommend it highly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is now the third time I ' ve stayed here and each time I have been unable to check in at 3 ##pm at the stated time . The front desk staff was rude and explained that check in starts at 3 ##pm and can go ##nal ##l the way to 5 pm . Um ##mm . . I paid almost $ 300 to stay here . The Super 8 let ' s you check in on time and even earlier . They need to hire more cleaning staff and friend ##lier front des ##t staff . I will not stay her any longer or recommend this hotel . Please don ' t book here if you actually need to check in before dinner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This beautiful art de ##co - is ##h hotel , feels both no ##stal ##gic and new . Wonderful bar / lobby area and the quiet rooms feel clean and s ##ty ##lish . It was a very short drive from City Wine ##ry where we watched a concert . Over ##night parking at the hotel is very price ##y ; however garage ##s are nearby for a fraction of the cost . Close to City Wine ##ry and in the Theater District , we hope to be back again soon … . a shout out to Amber for making this bout ##ique hotel a little more special on our night out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the fair ##mont Chicago . It ' s in a great location across from millennium park , blocks from the lake and the river and walking distance to Michigan Ave for shopping . The hotel is fair ##mont standards so clean , comfortable beds and great service . If you have the chance stay on the Fair ##mont Gold floors and you have access to a private lounge with food and drinks . Love this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , well located , friendly staff , clean and comfortable . Would define ##tly stay next time in Chicago . Very close to the Ma ##gni ##ficient mile , quiet room at least on the 24th floor . Fast elevators , nice breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very well run , extremely comfortable and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting hotel . The bell staff was very nice and helpful . My idea of a full service luxury hotel without the pre ##tens ##e that often goes along with such places . I have stayed on business at the g ##litz ##y silver tower on the river with a prominent name on it . I felt that the Intercontinental was much more comfortable , reasonably priced and had more at ##ten ##tive staff . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay in Chicago , even though it was for a short time . The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was very clean , had beautiful views , and great light cancel ##ling shades . Michelle at the front desk was so helpful and welcoming ! She is a g ##em of an employee ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] After doing a lot of research in regards to hotel quality and price in the magnificent mile area , I chose the Talbot ##t , and was extremely pleased with my overall experience . Some of the best restaurants in the city or within a short walk , the staff is professional and helpful , and the rooms are clean and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful accommodation ##s ! The staff goes above and beyond to accommodate you . Clean and spacious rooms . Great location . Stay ##ed here for business . It ’ s connected to many small restaurants and shops through the Path ##way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very impressed with the hotel . Taking the CA ##T blue line from O ' ha ##re to Clark / Lake stop was easy . Then a 5 minute walk to the hotel . Michael at the reception desk was very welcoming . Since I arrived well before the 3 ##pm check in , he offered me a early check in , because he had a room available . I had been traveling since 4 ##am , this gesture w ##ss appreciated . I attended a wedding at the hotel , everything was wonderful . Second to the bride and groom the trains passing by the W ##al ##nut Ball ##room windows were spectacular . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first s ##tat at this hotel ( we visit Chicago 4 - 5 times a year ) . What an amazing hotel ! Great and helpful staff , large rooms , a great view ( we had room 111 ##0 , which over ##look ##s the Chicago River ) ! We must have gotten a great rate ( $ 125 / night ) . It ' s a great place that we will certainly stay at again ! Thanks to everyone there for making it a great experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice hotel in the theatre district . We paid for a room up grade but the rooms are still quite ' co ##sy ' ! The de ##cor is very nice and the public areas are spacious if you do not visit when there are events / weddings taking place ! Unfortunately we only found the details of our hotel amenities hidden in a small drawer at the end of our stay so we had no idea there was a restaurant attached down a small corridor on the way to the rest ##rooms until the last day of our stay ! But now you know there is ! We actually had used the restaurant one evening approaching from the street which is past the attached theatre next door ! It is restaurant 123 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A renovation is a must for an hotel with big names . It is known that all SP ##G hotels are applying the go green policy . The question is how you go green if you save the water but you don ##t save the energy ? In she ##rato ##n grand you can leave your room and all lights are on . We applies sensors technologies to the refrigerator and items but not for the lights and safe . You don t feel safe to use the safe of the room because it is old generation safe . The list of maintenance and renovation is long an action is required [SEP]
1	[CLS] The only reason I didn ' t give this 5 stars was the check in line was ridiculous ##ly long with only 2 employees checking people in . This was a sold out weekend , come on Hilton what were you thinking ? Also our room was to close to the elevators and we could hear them all night long . Extreme ##ly noisy . Room ##s were comfortable , but small . That ' s to be expected in an older hotel in a large city . Besides we weren ' t in Chicago to sit in a hotel room . We I say here again - yes , I would just make sure my room wasn ' t by the elevators . The location of the this hotel is perfect . Walking distance to most main attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel tried to up charge room rate by denying that previously booked business meeting room rates were available at check in . They were available but I then had to move out of my original room after checking in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here for three nights and many plus points I . e . prose ##cco event , location . However the rooms are dark , the interior designer should visit Miami for inspiration for lighter colours . Who wants to stay in a room decorated with black , brown and swirled brown patterns . We could not read in bed , yes guests do like to read ! My husband is elderly and the Sunday morning reception ##ist was quite abrupt with him . Twice he asked her questions and she shot back ‘ I don ’ t understand you ’ . We are English f ##gs . So rude of her . We like the Kim ##pton brand but this was a disappointment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is strategically located in the beginning of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and close to the business district . The rooms are spacious ; have a good spread of b ##uff ##et menu and various eating options . You can walk down to all the destinations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We took a small 3 day trip to explore some of the things that Chicago had to offer . Kim ##pton was a great choice as it was central ##ly located within the Loop and walking distance to Millennium Park , Navy Pier , and the Willis ( formerly Sears ) Tower . Room ##s were exceptionally large and comfortable . En ##ti ##re facility was extremely clean and neat . Hotel gym was about average . The happy hour was an unexpected touch . Staff was extremely polite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Free wine when we walked in to check in ! Love ##d that . Happy hour wine and treats . Cool de ##co in lobby and rooms . Very comfortable beds and great service . Ex ##pen ##sive v ##alet / parking . Location is great , close to the river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 5 nights as my brother was running the marathon , and we couldn ' t fault the hotel at all . The location was great , by the river , and both the parks and Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping just 5 minutes away in either direction . The staff were very welcoming and helpful . The room was spacious and quiet , and the bed com ##fy , although we were both enjoyed the window seat and cushion ##s so we could watch the world go by . The E ##L is close by but we were not bothered by any noise from the 7th floor . The connected restaurant served lovely breakfast , br ##unch & dinner . We enjoyed the daily ' wine hour ' which was free wine served in the lobby area , mixing with other guests and staff alike . They also had ice ##d water available all day , and tea & coffee in the mornings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A must stay ! El ##egan ##t and charm ing atmosphere with an updated nod to old Hollywood ! Love ##d the de ##cor , restaurant & a most friendly staff that work tire ##lessly to make your stay enjoyable ! I will return to this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Po ##sitive ##s : - pet friendly : my little dog got treats and his own band ##ana from the front desk . Very nice . - really unique and funk ##y de ##cor throughout the hotel and rooms - nice continental breakfast . From other reviews I had low expectations , but it was great . You take your tray to the common area and there ' s a great selection of past ##ries , fruit , cereal and drinks . You eat it back in your room . Work ##ed very well . - neighbourhood - lots of places to eat nearby and shopping . N ##eg ##ative ##s : - a 5 minute walk from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . You have to walk up a level to reach it . - our room had a pretty bad view of a back alley . Not much natural light . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My family and I recently stayed here to celebrate our daughter ’ s first birthday . During our stay here , we were treated like royalty . The staff was always friendly , polite , and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting especially for our little baby , who can cause a bit of a mess sometimes as babies do . And the dining staff for breakfast was absolutely amazing . The hostess Din ##ka even noticed when our daughter dropped her p ##ac ##ifier , came over , picked it up , and cleaned it without us even asking . They , also , provided us with snack ##s to take with for our baby . Thank you , Din ##ka and all of the dining staff , for being so ho ##sp ##ita ##ble and making our stay an excellent one . We cannot wait to visit again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Of all the hotels I ' ve ever stayed in , this was the clean ##est room . It looks like there has been some re ##no work and it ' s nice they haven ' t stray ##ed from it ' s bout ##ique charm . I had a 3rd floor room and it was huge . No views , but I arrived late , so no big deal . I couldn ' t hear any other guest regardless of time of day . This was my first time at the hotel and will definitely go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We s ##p ##lu ##rge ##d on two nights at the Fair ##mont Chicago - we stayed at a Fair ##mont in Ban ##ff 15 years ago am ##d remembered it so fond ##ly . However , there is nothing special about this hotel - certainly not worth the price . The $ 20 daily “ am ##eni ##ty fee ” for w ##if ##i and calls is an insult . Next time I will spend my money more wise ##ly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is beautiful . You always see this stunning pictures of the ceiling but they are not going to make you pictures of the bathroom ( way to small ) or of the furniture ##s or lack there off either . Got upgraded to a luxury room . Really ? The lounge upstairs is more “ Hampton Inn “ than “ Hilton ” . They have a Star ##bu ##cks downstairs , obviously it ’ s 30 % more than a regular Star ##bu ##cks . . . . . Will not go back and don ’ t expect the door ##man ’ s outside to help you when you get out of your taxi , they are too busy chatting with each other . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On check in we were told about all amenities and events that were available in the hotel during our stay . Staff were excellent , room was clean , and the only down ##side is it is a bit of a walk ( 20 - 30 Minutes ) from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and Navy Pier [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have just left the Hilton Conrad Chicago for a few days celebrating my birthday . The hotel is very smart and you can tell this is a pretty new place ! The staff are very friendly and the extra personal touches made during our stay really were nice . This hotel is a luxury hotel and as a result the rates are as you would expect for a high - end hotel so don ’ t be surprised . You get what you pay for ! The only improvement I would suggest is the speed of service in both bars / restaurants which was slow sometimes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were incredibly warm , especially when we slept . The last day of our trip our room keys were de ##activated at 9 : 30 AM which almost made us miss our flight . Security was supposed to assist but they never showed up which required us going to the lobby . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been going to Chicago for a week long pleasure trip for over twenty years in December . I always know my trip will be great when I stay in my spacious room atop the O ##m ##ni Hotel . I have every am ##eni ##ty I need , a spectacular view , great food and exceptional service from their warm and friendly staff . When I ' m at the O ##m ##ni . . . it feels like home . I wouldn ' t even consider staying anywhere else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent . The service was Great . The housekeeper left me a note that really made my Day . . just saying have a nice Day . . never expected to re ##ce ##ice ##d a nice note . when you travel away home you appreciate this little details [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is always a nice feeling to enter a Kim ##pton and the Monaco was no exception . Great staff and good facilities matched with an excellent location near the river made my stay here very enjoyable . Ask for a room overlooking the river if available . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first time visiting Chicago and honestly because of how nice the hotel was and how welcoming the staff was we felt very safe and entertained . Clean and comfortable stay . We would recommend this place to stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . My wife and I enjoyed 4 nights at this property while in town for a concert . Always enjoy the neighborhood feel of this hotel , its location , and proximity to over the top restaurants and shopping . We ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] B ##rough ##t my vehicle right up front and walked in with bag service . The front desk was welcoming and had my room ready immediately . The room was updated and very clean with no issues or concerns . I highly recommend when staying in Chicago . Also plenty of restaurants all around . Right across the street from Harry Carey ' s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel for 63 days while our home was being repaired . While we missed our home the large suite with a kitchen ##ette and separate bedroom was very comfortable . The compliment ##ary food was good and the staff at this location was exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is fantastic , right in the midst of shopping and restaurants in downtown Chicago . The rooms are bright and comfortable and the included breakfast was really good ( same quality of b ##uff ##et that would cost $ 20 at another hotel ) . My only issue was that the two elevators were very slow and often full of staff and large cart ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff here are phenomena ##l . They went out of their way to make our stay great . Staff went above and beyond to help with random odd requests . Man ##dan ##a in the gold lounge made my son very happy and really seems to take pride in her job . We enjoyed our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I chose this hotel for its location , and I wasn ’ t disappointed . It is right on Michigan Ave , near shops , restaurants , and the beautiful River Walk . The Millennium Park is just minutes away . The room is clean and well appointed . However , the bathroom is a bit small without a separate shower stall . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was amazing , such beautiful views of the surrounding city . The hotel is very clean , had great staff , and comfortable rooms . One of the biggest plus ##es was the free breakfast in the morning , nice way to start the day . Located close to restaurants , shopping , and entertainment the location is perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here with a conference this week . We all checked in on the same day of course , and even though they knew the group was coming they were under ##sta ##ffed and had an hour wait just to check in . Our mini ##bar was never rest ##ock ##ed in the for days we were there , then upon checking out we discovered even though we v ##alet ##ed our car , they told us they don ' t bring cars around to the entrance . Instead your have to take all of your luggage to their parking garage to retrieve your car . De ##fin ##ite ##ly , not good service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##iara escorted us through this historic property whose owners include Al Cap ##one and Hugh He ##f ##ner . The C ##rist ##al Ball ##room is exquisite and has been restored to its original s ##ple ##ndo ##r . The secret stairway from the top floor pen ##thouse was a ho ##ot ! T ##iara was absolutely te ##rri ##fic ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you prefer a nice hotel ( at a good price ) with comfortable rooms then this might be the hotel for you . Great service and at ##ten ##tive staff during my last two stays . El ##eva ##tors are quick and efficient compared to other high rise hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I were in Chicago for a wedding and stayed at Ki ##nz ##ie . Our stay was excellent . The room was perfect . House ##keeping worked around our schedule . The breakfast was a bonus ; and the evening happy hour was fun . The hotel was great access to downtown Chicago , and very easy to trains / public transit . Would stay here again the next time we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were very good . Staff was friendly . Easy check in / out . Location was amazing and it was easy to get from place to place and see landmarks . Meeting rooms were very large and able to accommodate a very large group . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff were super a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting with our flight issues and made it sea ##m ##less and easy which was appreciated , but the room had a foul odor that was not fixed and the bar staff accused my husband of not paying his ta ##b . He was a ##pol ##og ##etic and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting after but it was off - putting that he was accused and we had to prove we did not steal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my 2nd time with So ##fit ##el and I was not disappointed . The hotel is modern and sophisticated . I arrived early ( around noon ) to store my luggage . They were so nice to let me to do an early check - in due to availability . I consider this an exceptional service . The room is needles ##s to say to be above par . Bath r ##ob , slip ##pers , La ##n ##vin amenities ( w ##ow ! ) . . . everything you need is there . The bed is again super com ##fy . B ##t ##w , great location and super close to name brands for shopping . A ##rgo Tea is just right across the street from lobby ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay at the Talbot ##t post the 202 ##7 re ##nn ##ova ##tion and we really loved new brighter look that has given the Talbot ##t a less stuff ##y , more relaxed v ##ibe . The new restaurant is far more accessible . The staff is as wonderful as ever , most the employees are the same as before the re ##nn ##ova ##tion . All in all a great bout ##ique hotel in a te ##rri ##fic location ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Clean & spacious room and friendly & helpful staff ! It was a very pleasant surprise and I would highly recommend this hotel to my friends & colleagues . Would like to come back and stay here again for my future bi ##z trip to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed my stay . Downtown close to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Top notch service from front door to house ##keeping . My stay was comfortable and without issues described in other reviews . I did stay on a night that the room rate was doubled and not sure why . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Well folks this property used to be my favorite hotel in Chicago . It ' s sadly taken a severe hit in the last couple of months . I ' m a Hilton Diamond member and if my experience is poor , anyone with less status will likely be in the hurt locker ! I went from an amazing welcome upon arriving to " ah you " . . . Also generally a beautiful room to one that needs to be refurbished . I fear that this is the path this property is going down and it breaks my heart . They ' ve also closed the executive lounge which was a great retreat for breakfast or afternoon tea . The people in the lounge were first class . Finally Diamond members or any members with status no longer get executive floor privilege without begging . If I choose to stay again , I will update this review . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My review is for Michael ( the Irish ##man ) door man . He was so very friendly , and helpful . He assisted us with our train to the Cubs game as well as getting us a cab after we told him how expensive the one we booked was . He always greeted us with a smile and friendly conversation but was extremely at ##ten ##tive and fast to help others as they arrived and departed . He was a blessing to us ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent staff . Very court ##eous , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and helpful . Room was clean and updated . Location was convenient for walking to things . Close to the river and the River Walk . Nice compliment ##ary happy hour and continental breakfast . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here over the weekend when we drove into Chicago . It ' s right on the strip of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile which meant we were walking distance from all the shopping and restaurants . The room itself was spacious and clean , although a bit bare bones . Check - in and check - out was a breeze . The pool probably has to be one of the more interesting rooms in the building . Although , it ' s definitely not a pool for un ##att ##ended children . We saw a lot of business folks at the hotel , and most would con ##ver ##ge at the Michael Jordan restaurant in the lobby in the evening . It seemed like this hotel cater ##ed to hosting frequent conferences . We definitely felt a very corporate v ##ibe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This property is outstanding . We extremely satisfied with our room . The staff and the property met and exceeded expectations . We were convenient to stores , restaurants and to the downtown . We would highly recommend staying at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in a king room overlooking the river for St Patrick ##s Day 2015 . It was amazing . The staff are so friendly and helpful , the room was clean and a good size , the bed was comfortable , the food at the restaurant is delicious and the location is perfect . Everything was great , however the view was hands down my favourite part , words an ' t describe so I will add a picture . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ ll have to negatively say that my stay was impacted by what was some sort of drilling and cutting due to some sort of hotel maintenance just next to me early in the morning one of my stays . Surely unexpected and not the alarm clock that I needed unfortunately lost several hours of sleep to this . I ’ m not sure that this is a place I recommend to the fact that this maintenance occurred without me knowing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed three nights and loved everything about it . Location is great for walking to the loop or Michigan Ave areas . Hotel is small , quiet , modern , clean . Continental breakfast is on each floor so you can get your coffee , sweet ##s , etc . and eat in your room . We enjoyed everything about the Ke ##d ##zie and highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location , about a block and a half from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . We walked to the John Hancock Building , the Drake Hotel , and Oak Street Beach , and could have walked all up and down Michigan Avenue if we were younger . There are also several restaurants within walking distance . The room was well appointed , with a fully stock ##ed mini ##bar . The restaurant with sidewalk seating was delight ##ful . Perhaps the best part were the bell ##men , Charles and D ##wayne who greeted us upon our arrival , and remembered us and greeted us every time we returned from an out ##ing . That ’ s the nice thing about a bout ##ique hotel like the Talbot ##t , the truly personal service . I highly recommend this older , beautifully renovated hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel ! Super clean , great location just off Michigan Avenue . Staff is friendly , and check in was quick . Room ##s were super clean ! The only thing that bothered me was their modern toilet . It made noise all night long . Other than that rooms were updated and beautiful ! Breakfast the next day was AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! ! Do not skip it ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] One of my favorite hotels . I love the Conrad and the rooftop . The staff is friendly from the time you walk in until you leave . Very professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I always enjoy myself at The Conrad . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . The staff are always helpful and polite . The d ##é ##cor was new and the view was great . We enjoyed the continental breakfast that is available on every floor and occasionally the happy hour at the end of the day . Great location , River North , and I loved that it was walking distance to just about everything . I recommend the Ki ##nz ##ie and will stay with them again when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice . We stayed over the 4th of July weekend . The rooms de ##cor was nice . We loved the bathroom set up - toilet separate , tub separate , shower separate and then the sink . Love ##d having another van ##ity to use outside the bathroom . They have house ##keeping twice a day . The waterfall shower was awful no water pressure at all . We did the $ 35 upgrade for breakfast , cocktail ##s and dessert ##s . It was nice idea . Just go early and be patient . Small area to sit . The food takes a long time to be re ##ple ##nish ##ed and its very European . Vale ##t was $ 71 with in and out privileges . Only one guy works at night so you might be waiting a while . I enjoyed my visit but would not go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay for a business trip . Everything available that I could need while away from my family . Location , ease of getting in and out of hotel , multiple meal options , always friendly staff . I look forward to coming back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel at 20 W . Ki ##nz ##ie street in Chicago ! Located convenient ##ly in the middle of two of the most highly reviewed and rated hotels in Chicago , The Lang ##ham and Trump Towers . Close enough to walk to almost everything . Very court ##eous and helpful staff . Free breakfast and free hour ##de ##vour ##s and cocktail ##s in the early evening . Love ##d the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent five nights with my wife on a business pleasure comb ##o and couldn ' t suggest anything to make it better . Friendly staff , large well - designed rooms , great beds , free breakfast and even compliment ##ary drinks . Ah ##h , $ 5 - 10 charge for receiving packages ? ? ? ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved with a friendly welcome and token for some bar drinks . Room service was excellent and house ##keeping was on point . breakfast every morning on same floor level . Ash ##ant ##y Barr ##ios was just awesome with us help us out in every way possible . Mr . Ra ##fi the door ##man was so polite and escorted us out and in from every cab we took . highly recommend my number one hotel in Chicago and i travel a lot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two nights here . I really liked the facility & accommodation ##s a lot . The service personnel were so friendly and helpful . Our view from the 25th floor was lovely down Columbus Drive onto the park . They skipped a few beats with house ##keeping neglect ##ing to replace glasses we wanted to use . We called , they brought coffee & cups , yet still neglected to bring the glasses . In addition , they neglected to replace bathroom amenities . Our room service was delicious & quick . The Columbus bar downstairs atmosphere was just okay , smelled of s ##tale beer . We shared a pre ##tz ##el app ##eti ##zer & a flight of beers , which were delicious and our bartender was friendly and helpful . I would truly give our stay 4 . 5 stars if it was allowed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] one of the best location in downtown Chicago . Located at Mi ##chi ##gia ##n A ##v . shops , restaurant and places like The Art Institute of Chicago , Mill ##eni ##um Park are just some of the attractions you can visit just walking in one du ##re ##ction or another . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I have stayed at hotels all over the world and I have to say Hotel Monaco in Chicago was one of the best . The staff is court ##eous and doesn ' t miss a beat . From the time we checked in until the time we left they made sure they went above and beyond to make our trip a memorable one . We had our children with us on this trip and they even brought " good ##ie " bags up to the room for them . The restaurant in the hotel had a delicious br ##unch which we will go back for and the room service was quick . Overall , a great stay . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was awesome . Everyone at the Hotel is super friendly and willing to help if needed . Great location to everything Chicago has to offer . Over ##night rooms are very large and comfortable . Food and Be ##ver ##age at 20 ##E was exceptional . [SEP]

1	[CLS] We are in Chicago to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary . The hotel upgraded us to an executive room - which was a wonderful surprise . Ernest who runs the breakfast b ##uff ##et in the 23rd floor is an absolute joy . He knew all our names . Such a friendly guy . The hotel is ideal ##ly situated for everything . A little disappointed that the pool was closed and our room was next door to the lifts so quite noisy . But as we had free breakfast and non alcoholic drinks and snack ##s during the day we were happy to accept it . The bar has a real buzz about it . Thank you for making our anniversary so special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am not one to post reviews . So for me to take the time to recognize someone , it must be worthy . One of the reasons I stay at this hotel is because of the cheerful demeanor of Man ##ada in the lounge on 15 . At breakfast this morning , I left a $ 20 on the table for you ! Thank you for being sweet and kind . It changes the way people start their busy days . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As always the hotel our room and service were great . The pool and fitness area are top notch . The location is great for shopping and there are hundreds of restaurants within walking distance . This is my go to place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent three nights at the hotel . Located close to dining , shopping and the river walk . Staff was friendly and the rooms were clean . There was a nice restaurant located in the front lobby offering a variety of dining choices and a fine dining establishment with a bar and direct access to the river front . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the Front Des ##k agent who was straightforward but ho ##sp ##ita ##ble and professional to the extremely friendly door staff ; thank you for a wonderful experience while I was in town for a company training . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and honest - much appreciated ! The hotel cafe was excellent ! We had requested adjoining rooms and they were able to find something for us at short notice . And special thanks to the staff man ##ning the street - very kind and helpful - thank you Ash ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel Monaco was the perfect location for our overnight birthday celebration . It put us within walking distance of everything we had planned . Great eclectic design throughout the lobby and rooms . We had a fifth floor room with a north view and it was amazing to sit on the window bench and just watch the city go by . The room was spacious and clean , bathroom had good lighting and a light ##ed make - up mirror , fun animal print robes were available . The staff was friendly and helpful . There was wine served in the lobby Friday evening and most important , a compliment ##ary coffee bar ready by the time I went to the lobby at 6 ##am . Would definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a friend ’ s 50th birthday weekend and we really liked it . We had a one bedroom suite . It was very well appointed , clean , and the bed was comfortable . It was also very quiet at night . It ’ s very convenient ##ly located to Michigan Ave . and nearby restaurants . I highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always an enjoyable place to stay with your family . The staff members are always smiling and ready to assist if you run into any issues . Breakfast is always a treat , with a large variety of choices . Location is very close to free trolley stop to take you to Navy Pier [SEP]
1	[CLS] It has a good location and a great view . There are rivers and splendid buildings right in front of it , so you can see the fascinating night view in your room . Lounge breakfast included is simple , but you can enjoy Happy Hour in the Lounge in the afternoon . The steak at the 1st floor restaurant is totally y ##um ##my . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed only one night in Chicago and found front desk friendly and efficient and was delighted to have been chosen for an upgrade . The suite was so spacious and well designed , and as usual , the bed was incredibly comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location - great view to the river - ample bedrooms with the basic ##s - comfortable beds - interesting elevators - great self parking lot with friendly staff - nice small bar downstairs - all in all a nice place for a reasonable price ( It ’ s Chicago people ) - GPS might be trick ##y between lower and upper wa ##cker so be careful [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room wasn ’ t serviced for one of our three nights . Restaurant is over - priced . Bath ##room is out ##dated . The location is very near tourist attractions . The lobby is a classical beauty from the past . The bed was very comfortable . However the walls are so thin that our noisy neighbors kept us awake later than we wanted . [SEP]
1	[CLS] With a great Breakfast bar and located in the heart of downtown Chicago , you can ' t beat the price for upgraded suites . I look forward to booking stays at the O ##M ##NI hotel downtown Chicago in the near fur ##ture . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A little o ##asis within Chicago . The ch ##rome p ##eanut is the highlight but there are other interesting items like the towers with faces and the stainless entrance . It is in 20 m ##nts walk from the Navy pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in April of 2019 . Book ##ed 2 rooms . 1 was available at check in time and other wasn ' t ready till after 6 p . m . I was suppose to get notified through text that the room was available but never received a text . I went to the room at 7 ##pm and it looked like it was ready . When grabbing a drink I was warned the lady was being very rude they were 100 % right . However the gentleman was outstanding . 1 room the a ##c wouldn ' t work and blew out hot air , was forced to sleep with windows open . Over all it was an OK experience , I just hope this isn ' t their normal way of checking in guest . I will stay again because its near union station and the red line . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful stay at The O ##m ##ni Chicago . Great location and very friendly staff . Close to all shopping and fantastic restaurants . . . so many of them walking distance . The con ##cier ##ge set up a massage therapist to come to the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The people were great and the room was clean but not worth the cost . I won ' t pay that much again for just a place to sleep . The best part was the hotel allows dogs and " P ##ug take Chicago " was going on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our visit was part of a W ##yn ##dham V ##aca ##tion promotion . How fortunate for us that we were able to stay at this bout ##ique hotel . As previous reviewers noted , the location was excellent , which allowed for easy walking to the venues we visited . The staff were friendly , helpful and professional . Our room was s ##ty ##lish ##ly appointed , room ##y and comfortable . The bed was the best feature : firm and flu ##ffy . Sleep came easily . We enjoyed the compliment ##ary wine the first evening , which was a pleasant pre - dinner feature . The morning coffee and tea service was even more welcome . I need my tea to face the day , even on vacation . Although we chose not to participate in the vacation option at this time , we will definitely come back to Hotel Monaco . What a wonderful mid week break . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great central location ( 4 blocks from Whole Foods ! ) . Fantastic bathroom - lots of space , quiet room . Interest ##ing design elements , safe and re ##f ##ridge were in drawers , black ##out curtains and lighting are automated with a button by the beds ##tan ##d . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ##mp ##ress ##ive hotel and offerings . The only issue I had was a cool room that did not come up to a warm te ##mp . The hotel is impressive . The offerings are very good as well as and the top notch staff . I would come back to this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great place to stay near the center of everything in downtown Chicago . Bo ##uti ##que feel . Small ##er friendly and very nice . I would stay again ! The staff was helpful and we had a great time . Close to all the miracle mile offerings and all the great eats ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Swiss ##ote ##l for three nights and honestly couldn ##t have chosen a better hotel . Right by the ch ##ica ##go river the tall hotel stands beside the Pier . The hotel is a minutes walk away from the main street , you have amazing restaurants and bars around . We were extremely happy with all the service we received and would rate this hotel a 10 out of 5 . Ex ##ce ##ede ##d our expectations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was there for 4 nights and enjoyed it very much . Excellent location - walking distance to many sites and tour buses . I highly recommend the bar area - great service , good snack ##s ! Nice breakfast b ##uff ##et on weekends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just stayed 2 nights at Swiss ##ote ##l for my husband ' s college reunion trip . It is a beautiful building , inside and out . Great location , great service , great view . We loved everything about it and would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a college reunion here and loved the location especially . We could walk and explore with ease and some of the best restaurants were just around the corner . The continental breakfast on each floor , night ##ly app ##eti ##zers and cocktail ##s really helped us social ##ize and contributed greatly to our relaxing fun . The staff were helpful and friendly , the de ##cor sleek and modern and the sheets and towels luxurious . I hope to return time and again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked 4 rooms at this hotel , for a family weekend . When we arrived at the hotel the workers were striking . The only thing that bothered me was that I called two days prior to arriving and they did not mention anything about a strike . The rooms are on the very out ##dated , the pictures on the website are very de ##ceiving . The lobby is updated but the rooms are not . When I tried to plug in my cell phone , the outlets were so loose my charge ##r fell out . There was only a battery clock in our room and the the batteries were dead . I realize that you cannot change the architecture of a building but you can make sure their clock works and you can plug in your cell phone . I don ##t know if our family would re ##vis ##it this place . It would be worth looking for a different hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A lovely hotel in the right center downtown . Good for shopping at the Michigan Avenue and close to the loop . Easy Access to all the shops and restaurants . Met ##ra train , and taxi ##s access . Host ##ing the Michael Jordan ’ s restaurant [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was referred to the CO ##NR ##AD hotel , a Hilton Worldwide luxury hotel and resort brand by the W ##aldo ##rf As ##toria as their hotel was booked . Conrad offered high standards of facilities and service during my business trip . Unfortunately , the rooftop was closed ( Oct 26 ) and the food and beverages are a bit price ##y but a great location . My only complaint - - I was on the 9th floor and the street sounds and sire ##ns kept me from sleeping well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great for Chicago activities . The staff is well trained , persona ##ble and at ##ten ##tive . Unfortunately the room I stayed had aged furnishings and carpet . Don ' t give up on the property , simply ask if they have one of the recently renovated rooms available . Reno ##vations were occur ##ing as I was there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great visit to Chicago and The Talbot ##t was f ##abulous ! The stay was very comfortable . . . walking distance to great food and shopping on Michigan Ave ! The staff was so kind ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . Will definitely be back [UNK] [SEP]

0	[CLS] I surprised my wife with an imp ##rom ##pt ##u Chicago get ##away for our 15th wedding anniversary . Our stay at the Ambassador Chicago was beyond my expectations . The class , the service , the amenities were on point . A special thanks to Kay at the front desk . Her knowledge and expertise provided that extra plus that made this get ##away un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have an annual trip to Chicago at the end of February . We usually stay at the She ##rato ##n . Fortunately , the pool just reopened , which is on the 7th floor . The kids love it . However , the club room is being renovated through the end of March I think . Our room was on the 31st floor , and newly red ##one . It had a new carpet and new paint smell . The bar downstairs in the lobby area is a nice place to un ##wind . We usually enjoy our stays here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was the first hotel that we stayed in during our three city trip through the US , and we found it a very good base for the two nights that we were in town before moving onto our next destination . It had such a q ##ua ##int and unique feeling about it , with well - appointed rooms . The room was a good size , and we made it a real home from home during our stay . The staff were great and attended to our every needs with professional ##ism and at ##ten ##tive ##ness . We never ate in the hotel , so cannot comment on the food . The W ##i ##F ##i was fast and free , which was a real bonus with us being thousands of miles from England during a pan ##de ##mic , and wanting to stay in close touch with our family at home . We would definitely stay here again , and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel with lots of history . A little old on the inside , but that ' s what gives it charm . Je ##rm ##el checked me in with a hands ##hak ##e and warm welcome , something that 95 % of hotels won ' t give you . My friend also said it was her favorite hotel in Chicago . Will definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here with the family for 5 nights . The hotel is a perfect location in downtown Chicago . Close to almost everything . A really nice breakfast is provided and so is the happy hour with food and drinks . We all enjoyed our stay and thought it was a really good price for what we received . They have a heated pool and a work ##out room . The rooms are King or two Queens beds . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have visited this hotel several throughout the years and have thoroughly enjoyed each opportunity . The amenities are perfect , the staff is energetic and helpful , and the variety of services ex ##pan ##sive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location with rooms & staff to match . Kim ##pton ' s awesome beds & great black ##out curtains ensure a great nights rest . Can ' t beat the view from this one and anything you could want is close by . Take the Lake / Clark exit from the B ##L ##ine & you have less than a 5 minute walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came to town on business ( a convention at McCormick Place ) and was assigned a room at The Ambassador . Normally we stay closer to the river and a shorter ride to the convention center , but this time we stayed further north . I thought it would be an issue , but this hotel . . . I mean , this hotel had everything . It was well worth the extra travel . Lu ##x ##uri ##ous beds , towels , and sheets in high end re ##tro rooms ; amazing mini ##bar and pre - made cocktail ##s in the room ; 4 Shin ##ola bicycles free for guest use ; incredible restaurant ( s ) serving excellent food . Try the cheese ##burg ##ers ! The entire staff was excellent . Almost everyone called me by name which , considering the size of the hotel , is impressive . All were professional and went out of their way to be friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room is clean and class ##y . Services are great . Breakfast was included and it very good . I would rate this hotel a 4 + . I am very glad that I booked my stay here . Chicago is always busy and even on the 32 floor you can hear the ambulance ##s going by but otherwise relatively quite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent property , clean , friendly , great location and will def ##iant ##ly come back to this location in the future . Food in hotel was great and service was friendly . Great view of the lake ##front . Bus service right outside front door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are looking for an historic hotel blocks from the theatres , this is your place ! Gorge ##ous inside and out and the staff is friendly . My wife and I had a small room , but it was well appointed with up to date electronics and bathroom . A Star ##bu ##cks is convenient ##ly located right off the lobby . Would def ##inate ##ly return next time in Chi - town ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are clean and have lots of space , the hotel has a charming fireplace , good options to buy breakfast inside the hotel and a very nice bar . The staff was extremely nice . Location is good for dining but a bit far from downtown . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ing at the Kim ##pton is a experience . From check in to check out they treat you like royalty . The de ##cor is spectacular . It takes you back to a by ##gon ##e era . Please take advantage of the night ##ly Wine Down . You will be treated with sparkling wine . It gives you a chance to min ##gle with the other guests . You ' ll never know who you will meet . Style and El ##egan ##ce are the keys [SEP]

0	[CLS] I am a rewards member and I am familiar with the hotel , the establishment was clean as always however . My special requests . We ’ re not met . No staff ever reached out to communicate with me , it took me 3 days of calling to reach the front desk , that was disappointing I felt had my accommodation ##s been met my trip would ’ ve felt extra special seeing as this was a anniversary it would ’ ve brought more light to the “ room ” . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel we stayed at was very clean , organized , customer service was amazing and gave lots of info about the area . D ##wayne and Gene were very helpful along the journey and I can not wait to make another trip ! I hope those two men who helped show us the way are there again next time ! ! Thank you ! [SEP]

0	[CLS] My husband and I booked this hotel for a last minute weekend trip to Chicago . We knew relatively little about the hotel when we booked it but we liked the location and price . We were blown away by our experience ! The staff were so incredibly polite and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the rooms were just beautiful . We had a lot of things planned in the short time we were there and it was so relaxing to come back to our room at the end of each night to un ##wind . I especially appreciated the pump bottles of s ##ham ##po ##o , condition ##er , and body wash - there was more than enough to take care of my thick hair for the weekend ! We would absolutely stay here again on our next trip to the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay at the Palmer House . Our room was spacious and clean . The location is very convenient to great shopping , the parks , and the theaters . There are very good eat ##eries all around the hotel too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a shout out to Virginia from the hotel staff at the Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago . I left a pair of Bose wireless head ##phone in the gym ( great gym by the way ) . Full ##y expecting them to be gone forever I decide to call the lost and found department to see . To my surprise they where recovered . Thank you Virginia ! ! If you find yourself in Chicago for business or pleasure I recommend staying at the Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Is a Great Hotel , well located you can walk the miracle mile and from there take the subway or bus and in minutes you ’ ll be everywhere ! The food its amazing ! The personnel super friendly ! Its Wonderful [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is historic and has an amazing lobby but overall not impressed . Room ##s are extremely dated and could use some up ##grading . Do ##ub ##t ##ful if I would stay here again . Central ##ly located and walking distance from a few places but would have preferred a different hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There was only one person ( I believe his name is Gustavo ) behind the counter in the lobby . He was very professional and an excellent representative of I ##H ##G . Due to CO ##VI ##D most of the usual activity is gone for now . However , the hotel is still my favorite in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker were 5 star review - worthy . I ' ve actually never written for Trip Advisor before , but K ##wa ##me and Scott at the registration desk went above and beyond . Due to an unusual technical error with our reservation , there was a bit of a di ##lemma when we first arrived , but they handled it with grace and a pleasant disposition . On top of many sincere a ##pologies , they gave us compliment ##ary breakfast and in - room w ##if ##i for our entire stay . They more than compensate ##d for the hi ##cc ##up and made us feel like very important guests at their hotel . I would highly recommend the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for the history , clean ##liness , amazing pillows , but most of all for the staff who clearly take pride in their work in ensuring every guest feels like a high - end patron . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I are so glad we picked the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for a weekend get ##away . It has a lot of historic charm , is in walking distance to a lot of restaurants , shopping , theaters . The rooms are small , but we didn ’ t need a big space . Would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Talbot is close to everything - Michigan Avenue Gold Coast & Rush Street . A delight ##ful stay with superb staff . Co ##zy bar and restaurant with a great menu . The best place to stay in Chicago for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 3 nights recently in a Lake View suite in this Loop area property . Room had recently been renovated , and was extremely spacious , though d ##é ##cor was sparse , and a bit d ##rab . Could have used some sort of dedicated desk / work area , though the dining table proved sufficient for my needs . En ##joy ##ed the south and east facing views , as well as the general quiet am ##bie ##nce of the hotel ( January is definitely off - season in Chicago ) . Location is convenient for both Mill ##eni ##um Park , as well as Chicago shopping . [SEP]

1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago is a beautiful hotel very close to the River ##walk , Navy Pier , and Mill ##eni ##um Park . We got an amazing deal on a third party site . Park ##ing at the hotel would have been $ 53 , but we found a garage a block away for $ 12 . 75 / 24 hours ! We had an upgraded double Queen room that was very large with a huge bathroom . Nice shower , lots of space . Bed ##s were comfort and bed ##ding was very nice . Staff were friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hilton is an impressive Hotel and very well run for a big property . It ’ s a historic hotel that has been updated , located on Michigan Ave across the street from the park . The staff was great and so are the facilities , especially the health club . Excellent quality rooms . Its a great hotel for families and business travelers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Close to the north end of the millennium mile , and not very far from a variety of bars and restaurants . When we got the hotel , we weren ' t impressed . The staff at the front desk wasn ' t very helpful at all , and first impressions count for everything . As our trip continued , staff got better and better . Maybe that ' s just one guy , but he shouldn ' t be at the front desk greeting guests . Our w ##if ##i worked great , and was essential for our trip . At $ 11 a night , it wasn ##t cheap , but definitely worth it . S ##hout out to the bell ##man , Edward , and K ##wa ##me at the front desk ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel to Chicago with friends for a 4 day weekend . Excellent location in that it was just slightly out of the h ##ust ##le & bust ##le but located in a very desirable part of town . Walking distance to everything . Room ##s contemplated the busy travel ##er and were very well thought - out . Online check - in nice also . We got a room with a view without up ##grading which was nice . I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking to enjoy downtown for business or pleasure ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed in almost every hotel on or near The Ma ##gni ##fica ##nt Mile . I keep coming back to The O ##m ##ni . It ’ s location , quality of amenities and services , restaurant and spacious rooms make it my very favorite ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience at this Hilton , beautiful de ##cor in the lobby . Room was quiet and large and we had a great stay . S ##hout out to Angel at K ##IT ##TY O ' SH ##EA ##S ! He was great and made our stay wonderful ! You ' ve got a g ##em in him ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n is perfectly located in downtown Chicago . The front desk and con ##cier ##ge staff were wonderful and a special mention to Paula / Con ##cier ##ge for her attention to detail and outstanding service . Only negative aspects : double beds instead of queen size in a room with 2 beds and extremely limited space for toilet ##ries in the bathroom . The v ##alet parking is also expensive . Otherwise , lovely , clean and great amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here 2 nights for a conference . Vale ##t parking and check - in was friendly and swift . We had a corner King suite on the 9th floor with views overlooking Michigan Avenue . The room was clean and spacious . We heard a lot of street noise , but it did not hind ##er our sleep . It is to be expected when you stay at a downtown hotel . The location is ideal . Within walking distance to Water Tower Place , Navy Pier , and all of the best shopping on Michigan Avenue . The staff could not have been more friendly and welcoming . Will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My parents were in town and because if my dad ##s dog all ##er ##gy I needed to book a room . I checked every room with no luck . My final stop was the Swiss . Initially when I was told that they didn ' t have any rooms I burst into tears . The front desk agent Lane ##tte told me to go grab some coffee and let her see what she can do . When I returned not only did my parents have a room but an amazing view as well . I tried to tip her but she refused and said she was just happy that I was able to spend time with my parents because parents are important . From now on my parents will only stay at the Swiss and I wonder if I can make sure I get Lane ##tte every time lo ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie hospitality shine ##s bright ! The customer service was great . The rooms clean , the happy hour delicious and fun , the breakfast convenient on each floor . I was traveling with dear friends , we all independently commented on the professional , at ##ten ##tive and pleasant ##ness of the Ki ##nz ##ie staff . From the welcome to farewell . Ra ##fi was especially helpful . He had huge smiles , bright attitude and made sure our luggage and transport were in order . Jerry was also great ; he was sincere , helpful with a nice balance of competence and warmth . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service excellent . Superior rooms very large . W ##i ##F ##i fast . G ##ym tiny but for $ 25 you can go to the E ##quin ##ox gym two blocks away . They are doing maintain ##ance on their elevators so only one works at a time leading to sometime long waits to get to rooms , especially if you are on higher floors . This is a pet friendly hotel and there are lots of dogs staying here . They keep the rooms very clean despite this but I had barking next door all night on one night . Maybe they should have a floor just for guests with dogs ? But that is only negative of this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here because it is connected through underground walk to the place where I had my business meetings , which is nice in the winter ! Other than that convenience , however , there is nothing remarkable . The room service offerings were limited , so I went across the street to eat dinner . The window is not ins ##ulated so it is very draft ##y in the room . Despite what I normally would consider comfortable bed ##ding , I had to ask for two extra blankets ( they were thin ) AND c ##rank up the heating because the room was so cold . I would not recommend it unless its location suits your purpose . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights . Good location . Many restaurants nearby . Walking distance to the river and Mill ##eni ##um Park . However , service can be better . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary bottle ##d water was not placed in the room when I checked in . In ##formed hotel , and was given one the next day . But no bottle ##d water on subsequent days , even after I reminded the reception . I paid for half day extension till 6 ##pm but requested for an hour late check - out till 7 ##pm . The reception flatly turned down my request . I stayed at the hotel for five and a half days and was disappointed that an hour late check out could not be a ##cco ##mo ##dated . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have never had such amazing customer service . This is due to the one and only Jeremy ! He was there each morning to great us for breakfast and would do anything so we would feel like family ! One morning daughter forgot to get cream cheese for her bag ##el and Jeremy was there with a smile to get it for her . I would come back to this hotel if he is still working there He is the class of the hotel industry . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was small ( like NY hotels ) but clean and comfortable . Front desk was very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . There isn ' t a business center , but they printed our boarding passes for us . Door ##men were extremely kind and hard ##working . . . went above and beyond what ' s required . Love ##d the free happy hour in the evenings . Dec ##or is great . Restaurant was very friendly and fast ( we were in a hurry and they delivered quickly ) . Last ##ly , you can ' t beat the location . . . within walking distance to popular attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the last 15 years I have visited Chicago 3 - 4 times a year for work . During that time I have stayed at many different hotels in this wonderful city . Now over the last 4 years in order to maintain my Star ##wood Gold level , I do chose to stay in Star ##wood properties . While there are other Star ##wood properties in the city , the She ##rato ##n is still my first choice . While some might say this grand hotel is a little bit dated , what I love about it is the level of service from the staff , the location and that even though it is so large in size , it never feels too crowded . Additionally I always know the beds will be comfortable and that Star ##bu ##cks is right there in the hotel in the morning . At times I do reserve club level and would highly recommend that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The beds were really comfortable and the rooms were very clean . The staff was wonderful and helpful . The hotel is convenient ##ly located to stores and places to eat . The lobby was smaller than I had imagined . Not much to do inside the hotel , plenty to do in the city though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at many hotels in Chicago and this was by far our friend ##liest and e ##asi ##est stay ! We loved the guy at the front desk , his name was Vince he was so awesome and helpful . Also met a wonderful woman named Angie from house ##keeping who hooked us up with ice ! Also a very sweet and helpful person . The older guy who worked outside ( I think as v ##alet ) also R ##OC ##KE ##D so welcoming and kind ! Love ##d the people , loved the room , always came back to new sheets and towels at the end of our night . A very convenient area and super easy to U ##ber from since it ’ s on a one way street . Didn ’ t try the restaurant but the breakfast & lunch places around the block were so good and so close by . Also a Star ##bu ##cks across the street and a [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a re ##vis ##it after much time traveled and spent in other Chicago hotels . It was a great surprise and a very happy experience . S ##pent the additional funds to stay on the 15th floor as a Gold Guest . It is well worth it . The lounge is clean , has wonderful offerings for both breakfast and evening treats . A real g ##em too is Man ##dan ##a . She is a true delight and was so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting as well as a tremendous asset to your hotel staff . She made the daily trips to the lounge so welcoming and enjoyable ! ! ! ! The rooms have been updated too . If you have not been lately , you really need to give the hotel another try . Also , if you are in an in ##du ##l ##ging place , go to T ##AP and try the hot pre ##tz ##els and beer cheese app ##eti ##zer . It is off the charts . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome hotel just off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile Great staff , comfortable , quite surroundings Great place for either business travel or family vacation You won ' t be disappointed If you are planning a trip to Chicago , consider this hotel I have stayed here many times and this one is my favorite [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location but the hotel is far from its glory days . Mid - Scale hotel now at best . Very dirty front desk , marked up doorway ##s . De ##fin ##ite ##ly could do with some T ##LC . That said , for the price and location it is still a good value . Bed ##s could do with a replace . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was central ##ly located with only a few short blocks to the Miracle Mile and a variety of restaurants . The rooms were completely red ##one and were im ##ma ##culate . The service was very good wit the staff knowledge ##able and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] hotel was crowded ( peak time July I suppose ) . the service was excellent , from the front counter staff being so helpful and friendly to the cleaning staff . Location is awesome - just 2 blocks from the beach . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for one night in this hotel . Having stayed at the Millennium B ##ilt ##more in Los Angeles , I knew this one wouldn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . I love architecture , and this building is a g ##em . My room was very spacious and modern , and I liked the fact that you can Blue ##tooth your music from your phone or i ##Pad on to the t ##v to listen to your music . The hotel is very central , right next to the Hancock tower and the shopping area . A few blocks away from the metro station . Walking to Marina City was about half hour away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is exactly what I would expect from a hotel that is really a modern themed establishment . The de ##cor is calm and sophisticated and the lobby is great for catching up with friends . I stayed in the One Bed ##room suite which was spacious and well appointed . It is fantastic value for money considering the size of the room , but expect a City View which is not bad if you are out most of the day anyway . The suites are located on the corner of the building and have a generous amount of daylight . The Her ##mes toilet ##ries were an added treat . The staff was at ##ten ##tive and friendly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wow , just w ##ow . This is an amazing historic , iconic Chicago landmark . The Palmer House never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s ! The lobby is particularly spectacular . One of my favorite Chicago hotels . J ##U ##st a bonus that I get Hilton points for the stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best Custom ##er Service ever . Leah has been absolutely fantastic . Great service , pro ##mpt , and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Hotel is in the middle of everything with walking distance to anything you need . Room ##s are co ##zy and very nice . Train from airport goes straight there . Heart of Chicago . Honestly my favorite Chicago stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s small but com ##fy , food good but price ##y , service excellent - all expected . The unexpected is the very cool pool on the 12th floor that is a mid - century bath ##house frozen in time . Walking distance to many attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at the O ##m ##ni on Michigan Ave several times but have never taken the time to write a review . This hotel consistently delivers ! From the moment I arrived to the moment the door man helped me depart in my taxi I experienced exceptional service by the most warm and professional staff . This hotel has it all . Great location , great staff , great restaurant and best of all the guest rooms are H ##U ##GE ! With separate living and bedroom space . I highly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall I had a great experience . The staff was very friendly and helpful . The hotel in general was very clean . The room was very comfortable . The location was in a perfect spot with many places to visit , the Navy Pier , shopping on Michigan Ave , many restaurants , all in walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in a great location . They were able to accommodate my early check in without any sort of f ##uss . All staff were very kind and helpful . My room had a great view and was much larger than I anticipated . I was staying just for one night to attend a conference . I wish I could have made better use of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel . I come to Chicago several times a year and stay here whenever I can . The rooms are neatly appointed , the fitness center is comprehensive and the pool is a unique feature . Best of all is the staff , on this trip De ##met ##rius at the front desk went out of his way to say hello and help me solve a small problem with my registration . T ##G was also extremely generous and court ##eous . My advice - stay here whenever you are in Chicago [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was perfectly adequate - had a great location , friendly staff , and the rooms were comfortable . However , I felt overall like the hotel itself felt very tired and in much need of an update . Wouldn ' t rush back here ! [SEP]

Con ##cier ##ge and front desk AND Vale ##t parking staff were V ##ER ##Y helpful with getting C ##ub ##bies tickets , finding L ##y ##ft ride and places to eat and see ! Late night ( after midnight ) questions answered about food spots and delivery . Made use of the Club level for free juice and soda . Was disappointed in Clean ##liness of Club Level next morning for breakfast most tables had NO ##T been bus ##sed . Had to remove other patrons plates to another table to make use of a clean one = ( late check out was a breeze . In ##ex ##pen ##sive prices for 5 star quality ! ! H ##IG ##HL ##Y recommend ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont in Beijing is one of my favorite business hotels in the world . I recently got an opportunity to try out the Fair ##mont ' s Chicago location and was pleased . The location is superb . Service was first rate and the club very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . While smaller than executive clubs in international locations ( and lacking the free alcohol ) , the Fair ##mont Mill ##eni ##um ' s club was very welcoming and a nice o ##asis in a day filled with appointments . I will return [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great staff , great location and wonderful hotel ! I will definitely stay there on my next visit to Chicago . I will also recommend the So ##fit ##el to my family and friends ! Can ' t wait to use the spa activities during my next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Like the previous post stated , my room was extremely loud too . You can hear trains every 5 min ##s , sire ##ns , taxi ’ s ho ##nking , etc . . . I wasn ’ t able to sleep at all . If my room wasn ’ t pre - paid I would have switched hotels . There was no “ do not disturb ” sign in my room and 2 / 3 nights I was woken very early to house keeping knocking / opening my door . Long lines at check - in , reminded me of Las Vegas . I felt the bed was very old and too soft . My lower back was sore from sleeping on it . Last ##ly , the TV went out non - stop . I think the switched to Internet TV or something . What ever they did it didn ’ t work ! Overall I think there are much better options near by . I wouldn ’ t stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We just stayed at the O ##m ##ni Chicago for a family event . A ##rri ##ving in a pouring rain storm , we were greeted and offered a towel to dry off . Even though we had an umbrella ! Check in took less than two minutes . Our suite was perfect . The sitting area large enough for six people to relax . The large well appointed bathroom was clean and the hair dry ##er came in handy to dry wet jeans . We ate in the bar and our dinner and service was outstanding . This will be our go to spot in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hot water is essential in the morning for business people . When travelling time and convenience are two key factors . Lac ##k of hot water in the morning for a shower is a fail . I actually waited several minutes and tried to shower again , hoping that the timing was just off , and being on a high floor , maybe that could account for the lack of hot water . However , there was not hot water to be found . It was not ice cold , but never hit l ##uke warm and I was forced to shower , la ##ther , and r ##ins ##e as quickly as possible . This experience did not lead me to being satisfied . Fortunately , the next two mornings of my visit there was hot water for shower ##ing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bell desk held my bags for a while after I checked out . When I w ##he ##t to retrieve them the desk was un ##att ##ended and I had to wait about 10 minutes before any showed up to help . Everything else was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I highly recommend Home ##wood Suite ##s , it ' s just north of the Loop , a block from Michigan Avenue and perfectly located for easy access to shopping , dining , and all of Chicago ' s great attractions . The rooms are very quiet and comfortable , with plenty of space . The views are great as well ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing time on my birthday . So ##fit ##el treated us like family . When we arrived they upgraded my room because it was available . When we arrived the room had chocolate m ##ous ##se waiting . We also requested a small fridge when we got there and it took about ten minutes to arrive . Really fantastic ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for us , we were attending the air show and only had a few blocks to walk to the Oak Street Beach . We walked a few blocks to catch the free trolley to Navy Pier , our kids loved the trolley and had a great time at the Pier . Had a wonderful experience at this hotel , would definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel , well located , lively bar and restaurant . The breakfast is à la cart ##e in the Library , a very nice room although if rush hour service very slow and too busy , but quality of food good and good price . Room ##s are very big and very comfortable , decorated in soft cream colours . The bathroom ##s are ok but bath ##tub ##s are quite old and could be replaced by much com ##fi ##rta ##ble walk ##in shower ##s . S ##light ##ly run down but still ok , it has a go ##id v ##ibe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed a brief stay at the So ##fit ##el . It is well - site ##d for many of Chicago ' s attractions with many in easy walking distance . The bed ##oom is spacious . There are p ##ken ##ty of restaurants and bars nearby as are the shops on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and the John Hancock building . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There with a group with about a dozen rooms . Another large group of people came the last night of our stay . Very row ##dy , loud in halls , drunk etc . security called on multiple floors all night long . Nothing was done to remove the guests after several warnings . Instead , all the rest of the guests were up AL ##L N ##IG ##HT long . Total lack of on ##site management . Won ’ t be staying here again . The hotel can ’ t help when they get row ##dy guests but they can decide how ( or if ) they are going to respond to them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice and friendly staff . Room was clean and spacious . This was our second visit and plan on staying in this hotel in our next visit to Chicago . Location is awesome , walking distance to lots of restaurants in downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for two nights on business . I used to stay at The Peninsula , Four Seasons or R ##itz , but my new company ' s travel policy is more restrict ##ive . This hotel is definitely a step or two down . The rooms are clean but perhaps a little tired , with the bathroom ##s being very u ##til ##itarian . The best part is the gym , which is well appointed and spacious . I ' d consider other options next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] beautiful hotel . my room had view of the lake on one side and the millennium park on the other . Very clean and well kept . We had several meals during our event and food was decent for such a large group that we had . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here because of the convenient location . I only spent one night but my room ( facing the street ) was quiet and comfortable with a ve ##w of Harry Carr ##ays . The price was reasonable for a downtown hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is wonderful ##ly located , close to Michigan Ave , Rush and Oak Streets , yet bliss ##fully quiet . The window in my room on the 15th floor picture framed the John Hancock Center ( tower ) . My room was modern , clean and comfortable . No problems during my stay and the Cafe serves a wonderful breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The reception desk made us feel welcome , check - in was how it is supposed to be : Very friendly , knowledge ##able and fast . We were upgraded according to our online request however why we were given a AD ##A room in the end isn ' t clear to me . Nevertheless , the suite was very nice ( the westward views aren ' t that great , though ) , the mattress , du ##vet and linen ##s are heavenly . The triangular hotel floor - plan is unusual yet excellent since it separates the elevator core and ice machine from the rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There are plenty of amenities at this hotel . The views are un ##mat ##ched . A ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s were pleasant and comfortable . I would highly recommended . Co ##m ##fy beds . Lots of restaurant options within a short walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the 2nd time I ' ve stayed here . Lots of little special details . Beautiful ##ly designed & very friendly staff . The room is large with a large screen flat TV . Great location with an easy walk to many incredible restaurants & bars . Just a few minute walk from the main theater & Water Tower . Inc ##red ##ible value for the money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed our 4 day stay at The Talbot ##t Hotel . The service was amazing ! AL ##L of the staff were extremely friendly and made us feel really welcomed . They even upgraded our room for an early check - in at 11 : 30 ##am . The location is very convenient . Located on a quiet street but yet close to all amenities . I would definitely stay here again in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a superb bout ##ique type hotel that is perfect for a Chicago family visit or a business stop . Everything is at your fingertips and the friendly service is spectacular . The food is perfect and eating on the famous P ##ump Room lend ##s a feeling of no ##stal ##gia to your trip [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first trip to Chicago . We decided to take the kids for a long weekend to see Hamilton and I had no idea what to expect . Everything was perfect . Our room was adorable and comfortable and quiet other than the occasional distant sire ##n . The location is ideal . We walked to the theater , to the Navy Pier , to the A ##qua ##rium and to the shops . The staff was so polite and friendly . The wine hour in the lobby is a nice per ##k too ! We called a couple times asking for items we forgot and they were brought up immediately . The only problem is that this hotel has spoiled me for any others in Chicago . We are already planning our trip for next year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed the pool while the it snow ##ed and snow ##ed outside . The staff were very friendly . Walk ##ed to Jo ##jo ' s and Le ##go Store . Room service wasn ' t available due to co ##vid but Star ##bu ##cks was convenient for breakfast . [SEP]

Unfortunately it looked as though it hadn ’ t been thoroughly cleaned . House ##keeping eventually took care of it , and the rest of the stay was great . Great location , great breakfast and evening social was a pleasant surprise . Also , Having kitchen to use helped so much ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ’ t say enough . . . Connie Alex is absolutely amazing in the Club Lounge at the She ##rato ##n Grand . She remembers who you are , what you like , and is the most friendly person ever . Came to visit for business and she made it so comfortable in the Club Lounge . Came back to see her and a glass of wine each night , she makes the Lounge the best place to be after a long Chicago day . Thanks Connie ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] THE H ##OT ##EL - Check - in was uneven ##t ##ful . The King room was very tight and was an interior room with a single small window . Bath ##room was clean , tub a bit dated and overall very small . SL ##EE ##P Q ##U ##AL ##IT ##Y - Bed was comfortable . Other reviewers have complained about noise , but that was an issue during my stay . VA ##L ##UE F ##OR M ##ON ##E ##Y Hotel was fine , but nothing to write home about . It was just so small and is best suited for single travelers . Restaurant was delicious though , despite the quality of service . Would recommend the restaurant even if not staying in the hotel .

1	[CLS] This place seems to be mid renovation . They don ' t have parking and offer no real solutions for that . The location is the only thing that saved our trip . They seemed to have enough employees but no answers [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and very nice and clean room . A bit strange that the lobby is on the 20th floor , but ok . . . also breakfast was very good and there was lots of it . . . checking in and out was a bit slow but the staff and the nice location and de ##cor for sure made up for that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the O ##m ##ni . I stay about 20 nights in Chicago , but have never given the O ##m ##ni a chance . The result of my stay was four bed bug bites to my back , two to my head , one on the leg and one on my arm . Outside of that , the hotel is well located , but there are many better options for the money . There was also a weird stench to the room and having to take two elevator banks to get to your room is not ideal . Overall , very disappointed with my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was here with a conference so had to stay at this property . Room was tiny and down a dark corridor with a staff entrance next door that had staff coming and going with rolling tables and other items . Room was not serviced two of the nights I was there . Room service took an hour and 30 minutes and when I called for a co ##rks ##cre ##w they said it might take an hour and it actually never arrived . great location , but a ##by ##sma ##l service [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a lovely time when we stayed here . The hotel location is fantastic , close to shopping and lots of food choices , grocery stores included . The staff is friendly and welcoming . We were there on a Thursday , so we could go to the evening social . Love the evening social after a long day ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in was a time and has ##sle free - thanks Miss ##y . The location of hotel was so well worth price . Lots of things to do around hotel . A few click ##s to the lake front .

1	[CLS] Hu ##sband and I traveled downtown for Pearl Jam concert . Dec ##ided to stay overnight as a mini - treat . Glad we did . I ' m not sure why anyone stays in another hotel downtown . Is it the lack of a big name ? Who cares ? This hotel is q ##ua ##int and well appointed , and in a perfect location and at the right price . The rooms and common areas clearly have gotten a very met ##ic ##ulous update , too . Everything was perfect . We enjoyed a ta ##sty and calm al ##f ##res ##co breakfast at the in - hotel restaurant as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived in Chicago at 10 : 30 and went to the hotel first with our luggage , expecting to check our bags . The At ##tend ##ant not only gave us a room , we were upgraded without asking . The room was very spacious , clean , and the staff was so helpful . They have a great breakfast every morning . Monday through Thursday , they have an evening social . Very nice additions which worked really well for us . One of the best things about this hotel is the location . You are in the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and the subway and bus stops are 1 min walk after exiting the door . When we are in a large city with sufficient public transportation , we utilize it . It makes getting from place to place so much easier and cheaper . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 3 nights and were very happy with our stay . The club level was great to have breakfast or stop for a little snack . At check - in we received a certificate for a free ha ##mb ##urger to celebrate his birthday . The con ##cier ##ge was knowledge ##able and help guide us to activities we would enjoy . The room was spacious and clean . Bed was very comfortable . [SEP]

0	[CLS] S ##pent a wonderful weekend downtown with my little girls . We had a wonderful stay and would likely visit the O ##M ##NI Chicago in the future . I made our reservation back in July 2018 for a November 2018 stay so it was a bit disappointing not getting a room with a better view , but my daughters and I were otherwise satisfied with our stay .

1	[CLS] Grand hotel in downtown Chicago . Great location , Check in was easy , Single room was a bit small , but it was comfortable given the time I actually spent in the room . Clean and comfortable are priorities . Great having a Star ##bu ##cks downstairs , as there are no coffee machines in room . I did have room service on a Friday night , and service was very pro ##mpt , food came hot . Hotel bar is a classic , takes you back to another era . Great stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Op ##ted for the So ##fit ##el among wide good price offering for the date . It has been a while since I stayed at a So ##fit ##el . With my previous job , I visited them often and achieved good level of loyalty membership . After a while I lost my status but it was great to see that you still experience great attention to detail from the staff , high standard of service all along , great accommodation and overall a comfortable stay at a great hotel that makes you feel welcome . The simple details make the difference , but few hotels get it right . [SEP]

1	[CLS] We arrived early but were allowed to check in . The rooms are a bit small but very comfortable . the lobby was decorated very beautifully for the holidays . We spent a few hours at the ma ##rt ##ini bar . Our drinks were f ##abulous as was our attendant . Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful . Our biggest regret was we couldn ’ t stay longer . We will be back for sure . [SEP]

1	[CLS] the river is a half block away we sat at the Chicago b ##urger co all day and had a G ##RE ##AT T ##IM ##E . Wen ##t again 2 weeks later and stayed there again for Z ##ac Brown concert with 2 other couples W ##HA ##T A VI ##E ##W . Would stay there again without question [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is close to E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING ! If you want shopping , it is right out the door on State Street . If you want to see a play , the theaters are within blocks of the hotel . If you want to go to the field museum or soldier field , they are a 10 minute walk ! The hotel is very nice but you have to understand that it is an old hotel so although everything is updated and very pretty , the bathroom ##s are somewhat small . This is acceptable as the hotel is literally right next to everything and the cost is so cheap for downtown ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Disco ##vered the Talbot ##t while searching for a hotel for a recent conference in downtown Chicago . The location of this hotel could not be better for my needs . In a great neighborhood in the heart of the city . Staff was at ##ten ##tive , rooms and furnishings were in good order and very comfortable . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] stayed for four nights on a business trip . Pretty nice place all round . Room ##s as one expects from So ##fit ##el . Modern , quiet and comfortable . Room not too big , but then this is the middle of Chicago . The location is excellent , just off Michigan A ##v and at the bottom of the old town , so you explore all the locations on foot . Was really impressed by the staff . Super friendly and professional every single one . From the guys at the door to the Con ##cier ##ge and the cleaning staff . Really nice service in the bar for evening drinks . Had breakfast in the restaurant one morning and that was the only thing which left me a little disappointed . Present ##ation over substance . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a great place to stay in the heart of Chicago and a great place to see how fantastic staff make a difference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here about five times over the last few years and the standard of service has never changed . From the Bell Boys , house ##keeping and front of house staff everyone is helpful , polite and welcoming . The rooms are maintained to a high standard , comfortable beds and very quiet . Well done Hilton for maintain the soul of this flagship hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] ST ##A ##Y ##ED T ##WI ##CE IN 2016 . AT ##TE ##ND ##ED A CO ##NF ##ER ##EN ##CE . The hotel is perfectly set up to host a conference , with a large p ##lena ##ry hall and multiple spacious rooms for break out sessions . Lu ##nch at the boat on the basement or sitting outside the sun my daughter had a dental emergency , and the con ##cier ##ge took it upon her self to ensure that we secured an appointment , found a reasonable and reliable cab to take us to the appointment and found excellent dental services the gym and heated pool are a perfect way to start the day thank you She ##rato ##n Chicago for an excellent stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent stay , great staff and shout out to Jessica who gave the 9 ##am tour of hotel . Lea ##rned so much and was treated like royalty . G ##ym also quite nice and room was very clean . Nice view of Willis Tower from our 22nd floor room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s location is very good downtown near to many of the city highlights and attractions , right next to the river , theater and the best shopping in town , it has a good size g ##im with great pool and sa ##una , also good restaurants inside and nearby including the Michael Jordan ’ s restaurant that is good , staff is very well trained and helpful . Room size is not their high points their double beds are not queen so they couldn ’ t fit a couple . It is clean and for the most part up to date . I will definitely come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel ! The location was very central to the museums , shopping and restaurants . The employees were AM ##A ##Z ##ING , particularly Sheila and Rich ! They were so nice and helpful . The wine in the evening was great . Price was fair for that area . Keep up the good work ! There is no pool , by the way . Super clean rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s a lovely hotel , beautiful de ##cor and well maintained . I ’ m surprised in this day and age Hilton still charges extra for W ##i - Fi . The other surprise is the kitchen closes around 11 : 00 . So there is no 24 hour room service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location on the River Walk ; walking distance from Art Institute , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and a bit further , Millennium Park and the beautiful Bean . Hands ##ome and adequately - sized rooms for two . Nice happy hour in the lobby with free wine and a chance to meet your fellow travelers . Internet is free only if you ' re a Kim ##pton Hotel per ##k " member ; " otherwise it ' s $ 12 . 99 per day . Be prepared to pay $ 58 per day for parking . The School of the Art Institute of Chicago , which my son was visiting , ( an easy 1 / 2 mile walk from the hotel ) , posts on their website that a 10 % discount is available for visiting students , yet staff was unaware of this and would not honor without a good deal of back - and - forth with managers , which was unpleasant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is lovely hotel . The walls were a bit thin in my room so that I heard more of the neighbors that was ideal and the air conditioning a bit noisy . However , this was more than compensate ##d for by the location , service and convenience . If you are a swimmer this hotel is a special place . The pool built n 1926 is Olympic size , the perfect temperature and Crystal clean . The ch ##lor ##ine levels are very low . It is a thrill to swim in the same pool as Esther Williams and Johnny Weiss ##mu ##ller ( Tarzan ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a good experience during my first stay in 2017 already and this time , I arrived early morning at around 8 ##am to check in and was prepared to be told that I can only get to my room after lunch because that was the check in time . I WA ##S S ##UR ##PR ##IS ##ED TO L ##EA ##R ##NE ##D T ##HA ##T I can already use my room . After that I had a pleasant 4 - day stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at the Fair ##mont in Chicago last weekend , and we were thoroughly satisfied with all aspects of the stay : the room ( size and bed ) , the location , the amenities . Everything was superb and we highly recommend to anyone visiting the city . This was our first time in Chicago , but when we return , we will be staying at the Fair ##mont . Ch ##eers , Jeremy [SEP]
1	[CLS] A good business hotel . But rooms not re ##ple ##nish ##ed daily . No note paper or pen ##s available . Check in and out simple . Food options available on site . House ##keeping very friendly and helpful . Conference facilities very good [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here visiting a family member and came to the desk to ask the Agent to call for them and Kay went out of her way to help me . As I waited for my Aunt ##ie , Kay ( Kenya ) bring me a cup of coffee and I believe she may have pay for it of if her own pocket . Just thought it was great to meet and have nice people still around we never tell the good story ’ s always the bad just want to let the company know that Kay ( Kenya ) is A ##wes ##ome and she really care about the Guest ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] I went ahead and purchased the 30 . 00 for the con ##t breakfast and access to the 33rd . Man let me tell you that the server up there named Rene Martinez really makes you feel at home . He is amazing at his job and he really loves his customers . He treats you like a king . . . If nothing else he is worth the experience . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is a beautiful dog friendly hotel in a te ##rri ##fic location in downtown Chicago . Easy to walk to the River ##walk , Navy Pier and of course Lake Michigan . Staff is very nice and our room was quite large , beautifully decorated and super clean . We were upgraded to a studio suite . We arrived prior to check in time , and it only took a few minutes to get our room ready . We truly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to come back the next time we visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived at 1 . 45 ##pm and didn ’ t get into our room until 4 . 25 ##pm . We booked a family room , however the additional bed wasn ’ t made up and when we called for it to be made up , we are still waiting . . . . we have been waiting for over an hour , with young children at close to 11 ##pm at night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great hotel . From first entering until we left everyone was so helpful . Tea and coffee facilities in the room spot on , if more needed just phone through and it ' s delivered . Fitness room and pool fantastic enough machines and choice . Li ##fts were speed ##y and never had to wait more than a few seconds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , historic style . Great location . Clean rooms . Very nice bed . House keeping excellent . Porter staff could be friend ##lier and more professional . Would stay again .

1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wow I really have no complaints for the She ##rato ##n Grand . Great location on the river . Great staff . Internet was speed ##y . Room was decent size . Very clean . Quick v ##alet . Ok I thought of one complaint but it is minor . No room service during lunch hour . With some many options right outside and inside the hotel no one should worry about going hungry . I would stay here again when in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very large hotel , hosts very large conferences Some rooms overlooked river . Our room was large with very comfortable King bed Good shower . Room has mini bar and tray snack ##s , but don ’ t touch unless you want to be charged . Tax ##i from O ' Hare around 50 $ journey time 30 ##min ##utes out of Rush hour Breakfast b ##uff ##et is very expensive but there is a huge choice and it is very good . Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel should you want a quicker breakfast Bar also expensive Walking distance to all main downtown areas and Navy Pier . River cruise ##s start from 5 ##min ##utes walking distance Staff in hotel all pleasant and hotel very clean [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##ana Chicago convention 2019 The convention facility was very nice food at the facility was good . Great location theaters movies restaurants clubs everything is central ##ly located . The city was un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly clean and the parks and lake ##front walk was very clean . A very safe area . Everything is within walking distance . Wen ##t to a dinner theater very excellent went to dinner Cinema very excellent all the restaurants were very excellent . the only thing my wife and I wish there had been a refrigerator available in the room it specifically said do not use the refrigerator ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location , a little remote from the no ##isi ##er streets { so a better night ' s sleep } . Friendly staff , well appointed rooms , good views even from the lower level floors . Easy walking distance to the Art Institute , Symphony Hall , Theatre ##s , Restaurant ##s etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights . It was clean and had a nice view but I was disappointed about extra charges . It does not say anywhere that you have to pay for coffee maker , fitness room and W ##i ##F ##i . Also the parking is $ 60 per night and it ' s hard to find a spot the car barely fit . I have stayed at many hotels and never had to pay this much for parking and things like coffee maker and fitness room etc . Also you have to pay a reservation fee . After all the hotel is much more expensive than you think . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a couple of nights while in town for a wedding - our room had a beautiful view of the river and the beds were very comfortable . Easy walk to Michigan Ave . for shopping ! There ' s a Whole Foods just down the street that you can grab some snack ##s at ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice historic hotel . I ' m not sure if it ' s the de ##cor or not , but it ' s looking a little tired . Room ##s are OK , but bathroom small . Door ##s don ' t feel very secure for a hotel in 2018 - to double lock my door I had to use a chain . Walls are a bit thin , I could hear someone next door talking early in the morning Very nice bar area with friendly bartender ##s . However they only serve beverages , not even nuts or sa ##vor ##y snack ##s are available . You have to go to the restaurant for any kind of food . On the plus side the internet is strong and the front desk team were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent two nights at the Intercontinental Hotel on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and it was a perfect experience ! Co ##m ##fort , quality friendly staff who really care about the experience their customers have , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , helpful , and just great . I have absolutely not one single complaint . Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyable stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Historic property that CO ##U ##LD be charming , but the service staff der ##ails it . Front desk and bar personnel seemed irritated with their jobs . Apparently were annoyed and bothered by the folks that pay their wages - the guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel needs an update - dated rooms with significant wear and tear - the high price was not backed up by a high end hotel experience . Restaurant and bars are me ##dio ##cre . Fitness room was large but not maintained - t ##read ##mill ##s lacked maintenance and several were out of service . I had heard great things about the Palmer House - absolutely over rated . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our experience was actually perfect from check in until check out . Each member of staff no matter who they were took the up ##most care of us and did whatever they could to accommodate . The hotel itself is B ##EA ##UT ##IF ##U ##L . The food both in the bar and in the restaurant as well as room service was excellent . We will be coming back ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was in a very centralized area and everything was in walking distance from this hotel . I had a beautiful view of Lake Michigan . I had access to many restaurants and shopping also . I also felt very safe walking in this area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great location , breakfast b ##uff ##et is costly , but good . The bell staff and front desk staff was friendly . . . house ##keeping is great and quick . room service staff was also very good . . . The windows were very draft ##y ! Service at the bar was slow to none ##xi ##sten ##t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] won ' t stay here again , took forever to check in , then was rude ##ly told i had to pay for w ##i fi , not great for business travellers , then was totally ripped off for breakfast , offering orange juice then charging for it , was totally over priced $ 4 for a small c ##rois ##san ##t or $ 30 for b ##uff ##et breakfast . Stay ##ed at the Ambassador following night , the difference was night and day . R ##ub ##bish [SEP]
1	[CLS] Here for a week , and it was okay . Really dated , but clean . Bath ##room wall ##paper p ##eel ##ing off the wall and mold in the bar ##hr ##ub , which were minor issues . Major . de ##tract ##or was that Michael Jordan ' s was the only restaurant and it is too expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ent property . Well maintained . Extreme ##ly busy place . Check - in can take 30 + minutes during peak times so be prepared . Room ##s were clean , bathroom ##s clean , beds very comfortable . $ 250 for a Thursday evening seemed reasonable for Chicago . Overall I ’ d recommend this hotel . Ask for a corner room . The lake view rooms are nice but keep in mind it ’ s a canal and not the lake . You look down at the canal from you window and look out to other high rises . Not certain I would pay the up charge for a “ lake “ view . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at the H ##ya ##tt Regency for 5 nights , and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay ! The room was spot ##less , amenities great , and location excellent . The fitness center was really nice as well , they have various machines , including weight lifting machines , along with free weights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel is fantastic . Having the lobby on the 20th floor took me for a loop . How does the bar not have a television ? I ' m a sports en ##thus ##ias ##t . Glass of Me ##rl ##ot 19 . 00 , which I think is excessive to say the least . Very persona ##ble , and professional hotel staff , from the check in staff , to the room service personnel , to the door people . Double room was room ##y , great foyer area which is at ##y ##pical of most hotels . Clean ##liness of room was A + [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got a room downtown so me and my fi ##ance could enjoy a night out for her birthday . Beautiful view of the lake , Room itself is ok not as modern as I would have liked . I liked the separate shower / bath ##tub . The customer service is not up to par compared to other hotels we ' ve stayed at downtown . They nickel and dim ##e you with the different fees . Room service food is awful . If im ordering room service downtown i don ' t mind paying but it upset ##s me when i over pay and the food is trash . Wouldn ' t stay again unless room was free . Would choose somewhere a little more modern and that I know has better cu ##st service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here because it was walking distance to the start and finish of the Chicago marathon . Really liked the hotel - Co ##m ##fort ##able accommodation ##s , nice fitness center . Close to everything . Only draw ##back - no hot tub [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 3 nights at the So ##fit ##el Hotel in Chicago . The location is excellent , with restaurants and shopping all within easy walking distance . The hotel is lovely and staff is friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The beds are very comfortable , with a du ##vet and lots of pillows . The bathroom includes a tub , as well as a separate shower . Nice marble floors and very clean . The room is a good size with great views . I would recommend this hotel for anyone coming to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice clean rooms , comfortable beds / mattress ##es . Bath ##room spacious , water pressure & shower heads actually allow you to r ##ins ##e off . Friendly staff . “ Free ” breakfast , you ’ re better off paying for it somewhere else . Store bought bag ##els , no cream cheese , plain yo ##gu ##rt only , banana ##s came from the “ good for banana bread ” pile at the grocery store . Warm milk for the cereal . As long as you don ’ t care about all that , highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the hotel doesn ' t have too much to be excited about . the rooms are standard and services are a little lacking . I requested several times some tooth ##pas ##te and tooth ##brush but nothing has been delivered to my room . location is not convenient either . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ing system was a nightmare ( I waited an hour and a half in the lounge area for everything to be resolved ) . Aside from that , location was fantastic and just a few steps from stores , coffee , and restaurants . W ##if ##i was pretty good for work purposes . Beautiful , old hotel and I enjoyed the unique elevators . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I work in Chicago quite a bit and this is my go - to hotel . My experiences here have always been fantastic ! The staff is so polite and helpful I always feel like I ' m coming home when I stay here . Upon arrival I am usually greeted by Rachel or Travis who help me get situated , James always helps me with my bags and calls out to my little dog as soon as we arrive . . . . I love that this is a pet friendly hotel ! ! Not only do they always take great care of me but they also take good care of my little fur ##ry companion : ) The location is amazing . You can walk to tons of restaurants and shops and even better yet the rooms are s ##ty ##lish and the beds are S ##UP ##ER comfortable . I would highly recommend staying here - great hotel and great people ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , hotel a bit tired and not really up to the best tier of Inter ##con ##s . He ##ap ##s of restaurants in ##c Michael Jordan ##s and Star ##bu ##cks attached to hotel . No Club room for Fr ##e ##quent Inter ##con guests is a down ##side . Check in as a Royal Ambassador terrible , they made me feel guilty for standing in the special line . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is so good for a get ##away from stress ! I stayed 2 days and they met my needs answered all my questions this was my view and it totally relaxed my whole system ! High ##ly recommended the area has a lot to offer from food to tour hot places ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Close to many fun restaurants and things to do . Room ##s clean and nice but beds ##hee ##ts are stiff and rough to sleep on . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast was ok , not great options for anyone with food all ##er ##gies though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , all amenities , but the best is the incredible service to get the perfect holidays , thanks to R ##oan ##e and D ##wayne for that special week exceeding all expectations . Perfect for every occasion [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although the building is older and undergoing exterior renovations at the moment , the interior of the hotel was magnificent . The lobby area is large and exquisite ##ly decorated and the lobby bar offers a variety of services . My room was small , but , quite ornate . I was provided robes for my evening comfort and the bed was especially comfortable . The meeting rooms were nicely sized and the banquet food was delicious . Overall , I highly recommend the All ##egro for either business or pleasure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The only good thing about this hotel is the location . Only one person worked the front desk so there is always a line . The room was not clean . Tor ##n and stained carpet . Peel ##ing wall ##paper and s ##cu ##ff marks on the walls . I ’ m sure there are many better choices in the area - wish I had found one before I booked . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have come to Chicago every year for the past three years and stayed at the O ##m ##ni . Can ’ t say enough good things about their friendly staff from bell ##man , front desk , restaurant & bar employees to house ##keeping . Also their fitness facility has been so convenient and enjoyable for a good work ##out . Always love coming [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my third stay at the Fair ##mont . Room was impressive as ever , large , well furnished and quiet . Hotel is in good area near Millennium Park and lake ##front . I didn ’ t try any of the restaurants or bars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an excellent visit and enjoyed easy walk up the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for shopping . The Nord ##strom ’ s is just across the street and many great restaurants nearby . The pool and gym / spa is a g ##em , and was a nice retreat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room wasn ' t ready when we arrived , and we had an appointment but wanted to change . The clerk gave us cards for the Fitness Center so we could fresh ##en up and change clothes . By then our room was ready . The Bell hop ##s were also very good , helping us with directions and cab ##s and a shuttle . The con ##cier ##ge was also very good with suggestions , maps , and discount ##s . This was in a good location , within walking distance to restaurants and attractions . I had breakfast in the cafe on a lower level and it was very good . This turned out to be a good choice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price and how nice the hotel was shown to be , I was expecting better customer service from the staff . The waiter ##s / bartender ##s in the restaurants were in ##att ##ent ##ive and gave little care to my experience in the restaurant . I would ask questions and they were short . The front desk team at check - in was not that welcoming . It was more like " here is your room . please give me your money . have a good stay " While the hotel itself was beautiful , the rooms were me ##h - the paint and wall ##paper was p ##eel ##ing in the bathroom . My bedroom curtains wouldn ' t open . No fridge / microwave in room . The king bed bedroom was small . The bathroom tub was c ##log ##ged when I arrived . It ' s worth noting I could also hear my neighbors when they were talking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice location , central ##ly located on Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . All rooms are suites with comfortable bed ##ding , two television screens and large bathroom . Sound ##proof ##ing would help as Downtown Chicago is a very noisy place . Emergency sire ##ns and ho ##nking horns th ##ru ##out the day are the norm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice restaurant great atmosphere and amazing food . The friend ##liness of the staff was exceptional . Front desk staff extremely a ##cco ##mo ##dating and persona ##ble . Start ##ed my trip for business I enjoyed me stay so much I extended through the weekend and flew my family in to stay with me at the hotel . Our experience as a family was just as pleasant . I highly recommend the hotel for business and family trips [SEP]
0	[CLS] I came here for a business conference and then my husband joined me for a few extra days so we could explore Chicago . The organization of the conference was incredible , the staff was so friendly and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . It couldn ' t have gone better - and we had over 500 people attend . For us personally , Mel Baker , was very helpful in recommend ##ing a fantastic steak ##house and helping my husband with a flower delivery . She was great to work with . The facility is beautiful , and if you stay , you must visit the fitness center . It has incredible views and a great selection of equipment . High ##ly recommend this hotel . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Stay at this hotel regularly and I find it a perfect place to stay with all the attractions within walking distance . The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean and modern with coffee making facilities , stock ##ed mini bar , very comfortable beds and lovely views outside . There is no room service but you can order downstairs at the bar . A nice gym in the hotel and a decent running location along the lake only a few minutes away . I would highly recommend staying here if you are in town [UNK] [SEP]
0	[CLS] I just stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie for the first time last weekend and I was over - the - top impressed with this place ! I ' ve stayed at several hotels in Chicago over the years & this place blows them all away . I was fortunate enough to stay in the King Suite , & the views were incredible . This is a bout ##ique style hotel that has very new , clean , and ups ##cale everything . The rates were far less than other places that I found way less appealing , so I thought it was a great deal . The breakfast was special , not the same old continental g ##ru ##b , but higher quality food offerings like a continental plus type of breakfast . I can ' t say enough about this place ! My Chicago hotel search is over ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s have plenty of room to spread out , and full kitchen accommodation ##s add to the all ##ure . The staff was exceptional friendly and made sure all needs were met . Breakfast and night social hour included . High ##ly recommend this location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Beautiful hotel in the perfect location ! Nice ##ly appointed . . . Great service . I would happily stay here again and definitely recommend to others . Thanks again for such a great weekend in downtown Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful views , very romantic , perfect locations for shopping or the theater . Also lots of restaurants . The Palm is in the lobby . Walking distance to many of the above attractions . I ’ ve stayed there many times over the last 25 years ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chi ##c atmosphere , comfortable rooms and great location . Not much of a gym so if you ' re there when the weather is bad , you ' ll be working out in your room . E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##T staff . Noise can be an issue if you have loud neighbors , but otherwise it ' s a solid property . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Chicago is an older hotel in downtown Chicago . Close to shopping and your choice of restaurants . As an older hotel , note that the rooms are smaller . The staff are court ##eous and work to satisfy the customer . A good place to stay . Rate ##s are on the higher end but it is Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was great ! The amenities were great ! Friendly staff ! The room was bigger than I expected . The A / C worked great ! It was a really hot day in Chicago but room was nice and cool ! The bathroom was clean and bigger than expected ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our TO ##TA ##L weekend bill , with a f ##abulous dinner at the Palm included , was $ 7 L ##ES ##S than ONE night at the hotel where we stay in New York when visiting number one son . Also , in that hotel , unless you specifically request room cleaning , one does not receive it . At the Public our room was spot ##less the first and second day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Te ##rri ##fic service gave it three stars . The problems are satellite w ##if ##i that goes out , t ##v that only works when the weather is am ##ena ##ble , and getting only one wash cloth for two people was a draw ##back . That was quickly re ##ct ##ified , however . What really upset me was the fact that the work ##out and pool were being renovated and they did not mention it when making a reservation for a week . The beds are extra firm , which for some , is not good when they put a small comfort piece that doesn ' t fit a full size bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This review is for the Hilton on Michigan Ave . With 1200 rooms it makes this a huge hotel and I loved the location and history of the place . Everything looked modern and taken care of ( not dated ) . Custom ##er service was extra a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and made you feel special . Room ##s were quiet and beds com ##fy . I would however recommend you ask for a non - feather pillow cause the beds all have these super soft m ##ush ##y pillows and I had a hard time getting comfortable with needing to constantly adjust and fold the pillows all night . Other than that it was a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Easy walking distance to great shopping and restaurants . Hotel has been updated with s ##ty ##lish rooms and lobby . Bed ##s are com ##fy and room was spacious . Great lobby bar with craft cocktail ##s and good selection of b ##our ##bon ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Could provide a fridge in the rooms . Could not store any food in the cooler provided for the drinks . The room rates were good and the location of the hotel was convenient . Staff were very helpful and kind . Room service excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was modern but co ##zy . The staff were really helpful and friendly , room was spacious and very clean . Would definitely stay here again . Very convenient and central ##ly located to the ma ##rt for work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only 2 elevators , slow and packed . Room ##s were hot , the ##rm ##o didn ’ t work . Bed ##s were uncomfortable . She ##ets felt they were made of plastic and fitted sheet kept popping off . More attention to detail while cleaning needed , in rooms and hallway ##s , pool etc . happy hours were great ! Variety each night and beer / wine . Breakfast was mostly the same each day and not very impressive . I would stay again just b ##c of location , happy hour and price . Just be ready to take stairs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed at this and hotel several times before . It is probably my favorite downtown hotel in Chicago . Staff are friendly ( with a special thanks to the several door ##men i interact ##ed with ) , hotel and rooms super clean , food and drink at the Big Bar are great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is just a short walk from most sites in downtown Chicago ( shopping , Grant Park , museums , Navy Pier , etc ) . Room was a nice size and had a good view . The food at the restaurant was good , but rather price ##y and limited options . No issues with checking in or out and they were able to hold my suitcase on my last day so I could squeeze in a quick trip to the Field Museum before heading to the airport . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A special thanks to Gerry Medina whose recommendations on out ##ings and restaurants were fantastic and who went above to show us a good time and to the door ##man , Ra ##fi ' who had the patience of a saint in un ##loading , storing and re ##loading our luggage and countless bags . . . . thanks for everything [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location of this hotel is excellent . Staff always helpful and smiling . Gerry Medina went above and beyond to make our stay the best possible . Ra ##fi the door ##man was always there to help with a smile on his face . An amazing place and I would recommend it to AL ##L who want to enjoy the city of Chicago . The daily happy hour was superb , with delicious food served and great cocktail ##s and great bartender ##s . The staff was very efficient and took care of all our needs even though the hotel was booked . It is a very quiet hotel actually . Class ##y for sure . The many times I have stayed here it has always been friendly and extremely efficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great . This is a solid 4 star hotel . The west tower could use an update but overall the hotel was clean and near almost everything . Had a beer at the hotel bar and the staff was at ##ten ##tive but let us enjoy the drink . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Car ##pet needs to be changed across the entire hotel - the carpet smells . Be careful because you might be assigned to a room that is already occupied . No assurance that W ##IF ##I will work - phone service not available in conference rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Its expensive but you get what you pay for . The location is perfect for sights ##ee ##ing . Everything downtown is expensive so a quick pro inside ##rs tip the have $ 18 B ##OT ##TE ##ML ##ES ##S Mi ##mos ##as and Bloody Mary ##s for br ##unch on weekends . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The service was above and beyond the very best I have ever experienced ! I was greeted by Joshua who has the most brilliant smile and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting personality ever ! I was there to meet my Sister and the entire staff welcomed me like family . Du ##ane assisted me many times with genuine kindness , even calming me from a panic attack ! ! R ##oan ##a , well she was a delight ! ! ! They all were so amazing . Beautiful , clean , co ##zy rooms with spa style products . Wonderful ! Will not stay anywhere else . Thank you all . See you soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this magnificent hotel in 2014 in the June of that year and as soon as I entered the F ##oy ##er , you could smell the history . the place was im ##ma ##culate and the staff friendly . I would not hesitate to recommend it for your vacation ##s . I did not eat there but the rest ##ura ##unts looked busy and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is hard to find a better and affordable place in downtown Chicago that is next to the beautiful river , within walking distance to Millennium park , art museum , navy pier , etc . We a family of four stayed there for 4 nights during the Memorial weekend . The rooms were clean and quiet . Staff were professionally court ##eous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you happen to visit Chicago try not to miss So ##fit ##el Hotel . Absolutely unique impressive design . Sur ##p ##rising ##ly affordable for the location and services . Very friendly professional personnel . Mr Michael W ##aal ##lace who happened to be senior manager of the So ##fit ##el volunteered to be our host and has shown us around regardless of the fact that we were not going to stay in hotel . Our sincere appreciation to him . Restaurant , bar on the first fl ##or . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was in Chicago with family members to see exhibit at Art Institute . We loved being able to walk through Mill ##ine ##um Park most days . The service was exceptional , as always at an A ##cco ##r ##H ##ote ##l . We had an outstanding view across a park - like area to the water . The mornings when the Mill ##eni ##um Room was open for breakfast for hotel guests were especially appreciated . There are many not too expensive restaurants within walking distance for dinner but it was nice to start our day with a good meal right in the hotel , and it was quiet ##er / nice ##r than the Co ##mp ##ass Room . Should also mention the beds were really good ! Could barely hear anyone else in hotel . We were there for 6 nights and we were delighted we picked this hotel . Will do so again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great staff , clean facilities and an excellent layout for a recent conference I attended in Chicago . The room was oversized and amazing ##ly comfortable with a scenic view of the city . The staff ( thank you for the excellent service Si ##l ##via ! ) was so helpful and patient , even given the rush of convention check - ins . Outstanding location with plenty of attractions within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . All the per ##ks we expected and more . The views were outstanding . The staff were friendly . Close to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . We will make sure to stay here again when we go back to Chicago . Good service [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a fantastic stay at the hotel with my boyfriend for a night . Was fortunate enough to check in with Leah , who was able to check me in early and upgrade me to a suite for significantly cheaper than online ( highly recommend asking ) . The view of the lake was awesome and it was a treat to have the air show practice be right out front ! The service at the hotel was nothing short of spectacular , I would like to give a thanks to Andy as well as a thank you to Amanda from the front desk , who clarified something to me very professionally ! I also had fun chatting with Brian and K ##wa ##j ##ro ! ! Will absolutely be staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Right in the heart of downtown Chicago ! Would highly recommend the Intercontinental to anyone visiting Chicago . Kathy the con ##cier ##ge was very helpful ! We booked the architectural boat tour , which was our favorite part of the trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a 36 ##h trip to Chicago . The hotel is super clean , comfortable and quiet . It ' s definitely worth to spend the extra money if you want to relax . Did miss that there was no pool / hot tub . Staff is friendly - specially the bell / welcoming staff ! Only negative was that the staff on the roof top restaurant / bar was to busy to attend us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and myself stayed at this hotel for 3 night , 4 days . Didn ’ t live up to the “ Fair ##mont standard ” Room ##s were ok , nothing special . Front reception was rude at check - in and out . It was if they didn ’ t feel like being there . Pro ##xi ##mity to millennium park was great but there is more to see in Chicago then just that . Not sure I would stay here again . Just an average hotel with a high price tag . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an average She ##rato ##nh ##ote ##l . Standard rooms , facilities and services . It is a large house so all is very un ##person ##al . I was here for a conference and found the rooms a bit old . The a / c was way too cold , but this is probably also typically . The beds were g ##eor ##ge ##ous . I didn ' t had breakfast . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The whole experience was beautiful and felt like the hotel had been plucked out of the 1920s and placed into the modern day . However , when I went to go connect to the guest ' s w ##if ##i and realized it would cost me 15 bucks a night , the magic faded very quickly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly and helpful staff greet you as you come in . The lobby is on the 20th floor with a gorgeous view of the city . Modern look and feel throughout the property . Located right in the heart of downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel stay from Jan 30th till Feb 5th @ So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile great service ( more than expected ! ! ) . In the middle of The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , 2 Min to Michigan Ave Nice people and awesome con ##cier ##ge service - Ren ##tal Car Return in 200 ##m ( H ##ER ##T ##Z ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here because of the location but found that the hotel ' s greatest asset is its staff . In particular , we app ##rcia ##ted the friendly and kind assistance provided by Craig , the bell ##man , who helped store our bags and gave helpful suggestions about our stay in Chicago . We really enjoyed talking with him . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Spa ##cious rooms . Quiet location but very convenient to anything downtown . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Well appointed rooms with spacious baths , great linen ##s . Clean and sleek common areas as well as individual rooms . Re ##lax ##ing atmosphere . Minor details : Close ##t areas need more lighting . Would prefer standard pillows rather rather than king pillows . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sheila the con ##cier ##ge was outstanding . Help ##ed plan the surprise for my husband with all the little extra ##s to make our time special . The suite was wonderful and the service outstanding . We will visit again and ask for Sheila ' s help . I ' d recommend to anyone ! Very happy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I do annual trips to Chicago and enjoy the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker because of the value and location and friend ##liness and clean ##liness . Will stay here again and again . I had one room with my daughter and grandson in the next room . They too were comfortable and enjoyed their stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located in the northern part of downtown , the area feels a bit more relaxed than hotels on Michigan Ave ( 2 blocks away ) or in the loop . The area has great restaurants , nice shopping , and it ' s walking distance to many things . We walked to / from the Art Institute and Field Museum . Well appointed room and bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a nice spacious room with a great view . The internet , lighting , p ##lum ##bing and h ##va ##c worked , and were straightforward to use . The fixtures are dated . Overall the staff were effective , friendly and helpful at the reception , and our experience was positive . We did not use room service , but their were used dishes set outside rooms on our floor that were not picked up during the two days of our stay . The parking at the hotel is very expensive , and the experience of un ##loading and re ##loading the car at the front door needs to be better organized . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located about a block from Lake Michigan and within easy walking distance to the " L " and a variety of restaurants . My husband and I shared a spacious one - bedroom suite with our adult son . The king bed was very comfortable and the sleep ##er sofa was fine for one person . Every evening we took advantage of happy hour and app ##eti ##zers in the historic lounge . I will definitely stay at the Ambassador on my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel for a sister ' s / niece ' s weekend . The service was fantastic from the time we arrived until the minute we left . I wish I could remember everyone ' s name . The bell ##men and front desk teams gave us directions and restaurant / activity suggestions every day ( I think we wore them out ! ) . Lo ##l This was my 2nd Kim ##pton property stay ( Portland was the 1st ) . The clean , spacious and eclectic room de ##cor make you feel like you ' re a guest on someone ' s home . Whenever I travel from now on , I will look for a Kim ##pton property first to make my reservation . Thank you so much for your hospitality . It made for a fun family weekend ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall , great stay in this hotel ! I was proud to show Chicago to my friend from out of state . I suggest for guests to be on higher floors for fantastic views of Chicago . Room was clean and smelled clean as well . The only slightly bad experience we had was when we had breakfast . We opted to have al ##a cart ##e instead of b ##uff ##et . Wait ##er just passed us by several times even if the front attendant told him to take our orders . I really had to stand up and approach him just so we could be attended . It didn ' t help us especially that we were on a hurry for our Se ##g ##way tour . And worst of all , he wasn ' t even a ##pol ##og ##etic . So that was the bad part . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful , elegant de ##cor but dated amenities except for the Health / Fitness Club . Hotel layout was confusing and not con ##du ##ci ##ve to hosting a nationally attended conference . Restaurant ##s in hotel had un ##ins ##pi ##ring menu ##s , with average food and wasn ’ t worth the p ##ric ##iness . Room service was good but food was again , average . . . at best . Con ##cier ##ge service was less than helpful on directions or recommendations . No help getting us tickets to the musical Hamilton which was just down the street . No recommendations regarding nearby restaurants . 2 star experience for 5 star price . Sorry , but wouldn ’ t stay at Palmer House again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Here for Dental Mid ##win ##ter conference . We were greeted with the very friendly Din ##ah . After day one of our meeting we enjoyed cocktail ##s made by Don ##ny . . . not only were his drinks amazing , he had such a great personality . Can ’ t wait to come back for happy hour . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my second time staying at this hotel . I will definitely stay here again ! I loved everything about my stay . From the moment that I checked in , until I checked - out . I did not eat at the Palm , but ordered room service through the hotel and the food was delicious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice staff , disappointing hotel . The photos speak for themselves . Our suite on the gold floor was tired . Not Fair ##mont standard . Unfortunately the hotels email system does not allow staff to receive photos . So i need to post here so they can see why I was disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt is a great place to stay if you are staying in downtown Chicago . Great location , rooms , amenities and customer service . I highly recommend the H ##ya ##tt to anyone who is going to stay downtown Chicago . You will not be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Vale ##t was great and v ##alet manager was responsible and helpful . Room ##s were clean and views were beautiful of downtown area . Great location near shopping , navy pier and night ##life . I would go back and recommend a friend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Oh my goodness ! We love this hotel ! We are from Dallas and wanted to make this trip special . I called and talked to J ##ac ##lyn at the front desk the day before our trip . She was so helpful , polite , and resource ##ful . She answered all of my questions about sites to see and eat ##eries . . . Then , my husband also talked to Mel at the front desk , and they gifted us such a nice gesture of straw ##berries and champagne for our anniversary . Thank you S ##O ##O ##O much , Swiss ##ote ##l ! We loved the am ##bie ##nce of the hotel . The foyer is warm , inviting , and modern . . . and our room had a view of the Chicago river and Navy pier . We couldn ##t ask for more ! I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The minute i walked into this hotel i knew it had a lot of history in it . I didn ' t realize how much until I did a 30 ##min tour of the hotel with Jessica . She was so sweet and knowledge ##able . It was great to learn more about how this hotel started and how much history is in it . I truly enjoyed my stay . It was convenient ##ly located to many attractions . Easy walking city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is ideal for the a ##on centre business park , the hotel is connected so no need to worry about winter weather [UNK] rooms are big and spacious but could do with modern ##ising the de ##cor as a little old fashioned . The accommodation is expensive so you are paying for location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] it was the most com ##fy experience ever in my life in the world it blown me away [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location without being right in the center of downtown . Staff were generally friendly and helpful and the rooms were spacious and well equipped . Good place to explore Chicago from and would most likely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the hotel and staff ! Can not recommend enough ! T ##ruly go above and beyond to offer an awesome experience ! Perfect for large groups and events ! Fr ##on the front desk staff to the se ##cu ##rot ##y team to the group sales manager all are wonderful to work with ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was at Neo ##C ##on trade show and the O ##m ##ni was perfect . Not too close but not too far from the Me ##rch ##and ##ise Mart but next to the a Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and great restaurants . Good customer service and great and comfortable room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Palmer House has far exceeded my expectations . This vacation has been one of the best with the very spacious and beautiful room we have . My children feel so comfortable here it is almost like home . I will definitely be back to visit again . Would also love to be in the Tiffany suite when I come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a business meeting . The room rate includes free breakfast and an evening social with free wine or beer . Staff is very friendly and competent . Con ##ven ##ient to Red Line and tons of restaurants and shops . Room ##s are well appointed . What ' s not to like ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] great food but you might want to print out your reservation first their credit card system cheated me out of a night shower ##s are pretty slim the l ##ique ##r was expensive . . . its a chin ##se affair i spent it on new years eve . . . dining was great perhaps if you use a credit card have your information on you , i was excited to be in Op ##rah world [SEP]
1	[CLS] Never disappointed at this Chicago hotel . While room lacks Wow factor it is comfortable and very clean and what you would expect in a higher end property . Location is fantastic for tourists , right in the heart of the city with lots of restaurant options close by . What really stands out is the friend ##liness of the staff . Door ##men and Bell Staff were wonderful . Special mention to B ##K and Me ##r ##ham . They really made our stay special with their enthusiasm and at ##ten ##tive ##ness . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed our stay . Room was very nice . Love ##d the rainfall shower . Had issues with the elevators on our last day , but management was really trying to fix the situation . They even took us up and down in the freight elevator . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a really quick work trip , but loved this hotel . The de ##cor was great - lots of fun . They did a great job de ##cor ##ating and loved the bathroom soap ##s and s ##ham ##po ##os . The room small , but very comfortable and enjoyable . And the outlets ! It was so nice to be a hotel room with such a selection of outlets . I think I counted 14 available ( an additional 2 were used by the fridge and TV ) . No need to worry about plug ##ging in all your devices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Te ##rri ##fic location ; large and comfortable rooms . Friendly and helpful staff . Price is quite reasonable for the location and quality and size of room . Only real deficiency was that there were no places to re ##cha ##rge devices near the bed though there were some elsewhere in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed a Saturday night and a friend joined us at the last minute . Staff was exceptionally persona ##ble and cater ##ed to us in every way . Our room was so clean and the bed was extremely comfortable . We love this place and will definitely return ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay in this hotel twice a quarter and it ’ s a always a very pleasant and consistent experience . It ’ s amazing ##ly convenient to get to the A ##ON building as you can get to it via the p ##ed ##way ! The last time I was there I had ordered room service and some of the food had arrived cold and I called and they promptly sent up the same meal warm . Very pleased with the service and quality of rooms . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Soon after checking in to my room I discovered the TV got no signal . Called and was told the whole floor was out . It never came on . To their credit they did offer to move me to another room , but by then I had already settled in and didn ’ t want to pack up and move just to watch a little TV . Then ordered room service — just soup , some rolls and a glass of wine . The soup was so salt ##y I couldn ’ t eat it and the rolls were burned black . The only thing con ##su ##mable was the wine . This is supposed to be a highly rated luxury hotel and they charge accordingly . I ’ ve had much better experiences at less expensive places . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely beautiful historic hotel . All staff were very friendly . I would have given 5 stars but when I checked out I was being charged more than my confirmation . When I questioned it I was told because they held credit in case we used the room mini bar or ordered room service . When I checked with the friends we travelled with their bill was correct . I went back to the counter and had someone else and she found that indeed there was an error and had to give me a credit . The first clerk should have checked more closely . Glad it was fixed before I left the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff is friendly and professional . We were greeted from check in to check out . Restaurant generally has a little bit of everything for every taste . Room ##s ( suites ) are comfortable and relaxing . Good choice of hotel to stay at . [SEP]
1	[CLS] D ##wayne was very professional and helpful to giving refer ##rals to where to go and what to do during our stay . He has a great personality and very easy and fun to talk to . A true scholar and gentlemen . D ##wayne and Charles made us feel at home . We felt like we knew them for years . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ m Chicago for a company event . I approach both Brian ##na s ##mith and Brian ##na Bradshaw to ask where I can get a good salad for dinner . When I say these two ladies had me feeling like I am right at home and had great personalities . So often we stay at hotels that when ask about surrounding restaurants they give you a little list of restaurants that are not even visited by the staff . I appreciate that the restaurants they recommend happened to be something they both tried before and not just sent me there with a hope of a good dining experience . I would like to say thank you too these wonderful young ladies for making me feel right at home [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our first visit to Chicago was last weekend for a wedding . We had a blast ! The Ki ##nz ##ie staff wrote the book on hospitality . Every person we met was super helpful and nice . We especially loved Josh , the lounge bar tender . He kept us entertained for hours . Our room was one of the best we have ever stayed in . Top notch all the way . We will definitely be back ! Thank you for a wonderful weekend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt is very well located and the rooms are great . On the property you find a lot of things necessary for a great convention in all sizes . The staff is very at ##ten ##tive and the check in was very quick . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great and our room was clean , comfortable and spacious . We asked for a quiet room at check in and received one . We were in the East Tower on the 15th floor near the end of a hall . We would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed here the last 4 years and have enjoyed each year . The rooms are lovely and most of my rooms have had spectacular views of the Chicago River and gorgeous night ##time lights of the city . The hotels restaurants are very good and the service is excellent . Even the little Market ##place is perfect for a quick bite or a cup ##pa to go . The banquet facilities are lovely and always managed well . The location can ' t be beat - it ' s easy to get anywhere in the city by cab , U ##ber , L ##y ##ft or foot . . . and the airport shuttle picks up and drops off convenient ##ly at the West Tower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el has become my place of choice for weekend trips to the city , you can walk to the best shopping and some of the best restaurants in Chicago , plus parking is quite easy in this area . The staff is always friendly and the rooms are always as nice and clean as expected . Breakfast in the restaurant is a highlight , these people know how to cook eggs . Love the Po ##tas ##h market around the corner where you can pick up any necessity for your trip , plus they have a heavenly del ##i counter . [SEP]
1	[CLS] if you are visiting Chicago the Monaco is worth looking at . Great location A + and the rooms are spacious and comfortable . The staff was over the top . Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Health club was typical & sufficient . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is huge and very imp ##erson ##al . Whilst we found the bedroom very comfortable and the sleep quality was great , this old hotel requires a modern ##isation . For those coming from O ' Hare airport via the L , Blue Line subway , the hotel is very close to the Monroe station . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel , good location , and close to downtown restaurants . Friendly staff . Was surprised I had to request a personal fridge for an additional cost . Con ##cier ##ge fridge was off limits to use for storage . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located River North , about 2 ##k ##m from Mill ##eni ##um Park or a bit less to Navy Pier . If you get a room in the upper floors you can spot some views of Michigan lake . The hotel is a very quiet location although the crowded Ma ##gni ##fica ##nt Mile is only five minutes away . Nearby are famous some blues bars . You can reach several good restaurants by foot , e . g . ve ##ner ##able steak houses or G ##ior ##dan ##o ’ s restaurant which offers variations of Chicago - style pizza ( you should be very hungry ! ) . The breakfast restaurant is rather unusual for U . S . probably because the So ##fit ##el belongs to a French hotel chain . Not cheap but worth the prize ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Did you change the room for us by the suit was the same problem location was great was horrible I hope somebody was paying attention to what it what I said maybe somebody can give me a call regarding this issue [SEP]
1	[CLS] I got this room during the anniversary deal back in November 2017 . I was able to stay for one night for only $ 111 . 40 . This was an incredible value . We stayed there for my son ' s 7th birthday . He had an amazing time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean and spacious rooms . Great staff and service . Close to everything on the Gold Coast . Was easy walking distance to great restaurants , the beach and miracle mile shopping . Will definitely come back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the best time at this hotel . The location was beyond perfect . I was given great food recommendations as well as fun events by Amir ##a . She was extremely sweet and knowledge ##able . Every question that I had she was able to give me her expertise . This is the most enjoyable time that I ’ ve had in a while ! She also gave me a grand experience card . I have no doubt that I ’ ll be back again . Unfortunately , I was unable to purchase a package for vacation but after my experience with Amir ##a and this hotel I certainly will buy one in the future . I gave this only 4 stars because I stayed with a friend of mine and we saw mild ##ew in the bathroom . Wasn ’ t properly cleaned . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago is br ##im ##ming with history and el ##egan ##ce . More importantly , it is a well cared - for and managed property with exceptional staff in all areas . Its location makes it easily walk ##able to Buckingham Fountain , the Lake Michigan shore and the museum campus . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Fair ##mont Hotel in Chicago ’ s Millennium Park is a fantastic location for a week end get ##away . It is right off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and so within walking distance of great shopping and fantastic restaurants . The price of the room with a AAA discount was un ##believable . The staff of the hotel was friendly and very helpful . At this time of year the Christmas decorations on Michigan Ave were beautiful but in warmer weather the beach and Navy Pier are also very close . Would recommend this hotel to old and young alike . We always stay at the Fair ##mont when we are in the “ Wind ##y City . ” [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 5 nights here and would recommend if you want to be close to the action . Room was very spacious , bar and restaurant staff were amazing and rooms very clean . Only slight ni ##ggle was the ' do not disturb ' sign was ignored on one day . Other than that the stay was fl ##aw ##less . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was treated as if I didn ' t belong at this hotel , when I ' d actually had 3 nights reserved at the hotel . The staff acted as if they didn ' t want to service me , and treated me like a lower ##c ##lass citizen . For the re ##ami ##nder of my stay , I avoided the staff and any needed assistance . I was staying there for a conference or I would ' ve found another place to stay . I can ' t believe I was treated like I was here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The employees of the O ##m ##ni were extremely friendly and it was a pleasure to spend the week with them . We had a corner suite which overlooked Michigan Ave and E Huron , so it was a great view . The location was perfect as well . We were within walking distance of many things we wanted to see or transportation . When we go back to Chicago , we will absolutely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my first time at the O ##m ##ni and I love it . The O ##m ##ni is a medium size hotel and has a good feel to it . My room was very impressive , nicely designed and decorated . They have great customer service , email ##ing before I arrived and even afterwards to make sure everything was ok . I have been to many 4 star and some 5 star hotels as well but this is now one of my favorites . Can ’ t wait to bring my wife next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have worked around the world and the staff at the Fair ##mont is by far one of the best to work with . If you are planning a private party or a corporate event , this is the hotel for you . Their stay is amazing , at ##ten ##tive and extremely re ##sp ##ons ##ive . Everyone from the Ban ##quet Manager to the Coffee staff greet ##s you with true professional ##ism and have proved time and time again that they can meet any of your needs . I wish every hotel had staff like the Fair ##mont Chicago . I ' ve spent 10 days here with planned meetings and they ' ve become a second family . By far , the best staff I ' ve worked with at any hotel ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent and great service , above and beyond our expectations ! E ##sp . since we had to be in Chicago for a hospital ##ization : The personnel here could not have been more helpful . In L ##O ##VE ! The service , location , food , and P ##E ##OP ##LE who are outstanding in their quality of care , should make Home ##wood Suite ##s by Hilton feel thankful for their wonderful sense of service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We typically spend a weekend in Chicago during the holidays to take in the lights , shop downtown , visit the Kind ##lem ##ark ##et and maybe see a show . It had been probably 20 years since we last stayed at the Monaco , and we were pleasant ##ly surprised . New ##ly re ##mo ##del ##ed , it was extremely comfortable and inviting . Staff was wonderful , and we both loved the fact that we did not have to check out until noon . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I visited the Conrad Chicago during our two week journey from Washington DC to New York , Wind ##y City and finally Los Angeles . Very friendly and helpful staff , a beautiful and spacious room and good food and service whenever you need it . The interior design should be from the seven ##ties or eight ##ies , but it looks and feels new and well maintained and transports a spirit of authenticity . A true home away from home . One more thing : I stayed at the Conrad ##s in Washington DC , New York , Bangkok , Singapore and Seoul , and the Conrad Chicago is a front ##runner . One last thing : Hilton should open a Conrad in Los Angeles , it is terribly needed there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is absolutely on point and the rooms , even better ! I have to say the highlight was the breakfast b ##uff ##et which was an activity in itself , na ##vi ##gating what to have each morning . I would recommend a stay here if you are time - poor in Chicago and want to be right in the thick of all the action and sights . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Just stayed here with approximately 50 relatives attending a wedding . The hotel staff was on their best game . I was extremely satisfied with the accommodation ##s . I was especially pleased by the ability to control the room temperature . Rare ##ly am I able to get that right ! The food was good , the bed was comfortable , the rooms were clean . The price seemed reasonable for Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is close enough to walk most places of interest or take a short taxi ride . This hotel ex ##cel ##s in friend ##liness and personal service , which more than makes up for the somewhat small room . The large bathroom was appreciated with a shower for 2 ! Co ##zy bar and street side tables for casual dining . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have to say that this hotel was beyond a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The first morning we met Benito and David at breakfast . I have to say the breakfast was phenomena ##l , the service was amazing , and these two gentlemen just offered friendly and engaging conversation while making sure we were taken care of . They made our entire first day in Chicago . I highly recommend this Hotel for all your Chicago stays ! Thank you again Hilton of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel with spacious rooms . Bath ##room with separate shower and bath tub . We ' ll appointed . Only issue was remote control trolley for TV was difficult to him change channels but may have just been a weak battery . Got a great deal to stay here on Hot ##wire . Park ##ing is $ 72 per 24 hours with no in or out ( typical Chicago ) but there is a public parking garage immediately next door for less than 1 / 2 that price as well as even pre ##pa ##y deals for So ##fit ##el Hotel parking online . ; - ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ’ t recommend highly enough . Great room , wonderful amenities . Fitness room well - equipped and clean . Restaurant was te ##rri ##fic . Fantastic location . Part ##icular ##ly appreciate Leah who checked me in and paid a lot of attention toward making sure my stay was incredible . Friendly staff , gorgeous property and d ##é ##cor . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Intercontinental Michigan Ave . Chicago is one of our favorite places to stay while in the city . The location is excellent and the staff is always there to help . Our room was ready when we arrived ; early by the way , and everything was in order . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a weekend of shopping and dining , and could not have picked a better location ! we were a 1 / 2 block from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping district and within walking distance of both restaurants . The hotel itself was wonderful ! It was very quiet and very modern . The room was very spacious and my wife was extra happy about the very large bathroom . The huge screen TV was a bonus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The single problem I experienced , and it was a significant one , was how noisy my corner room was facing Michigan Avenue . Sir ##ens kept me awake all night both nights , because the room has virtually no sound ##proof ##ing . I genuinely don ’ t know where the rooms on the other side of the hotel are as noisy as mine was . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location was great , everything was in walking distance . But for me it wasn ' t worth the money . We booked King Studio Suite for 3 , the bedroom was really nice but the sofa bed was worn out and kinda disgusting , wouldn ' t recommend it to anyone . They also didn ' t provide proper sheets for the sofa bed so it just made it worst . The staff was really nice and kind ! Breakfast wasn ' t too bad either , didn ' t have much to choose but it was good enough for us . It wasn ' t a bad experience but not the best either . Wouldn ' t come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was great in terms of location to all attractions . Beautiful de ##cor . Staff were all very friendly . Front desk staff was great . Con ##cier ##ge left us a dessert and some bottles of sparkling water and a note to wish us Happy Anniversary which was very kind and unexpected ! Every night had social hour which included glasses of Pro ##se ##cco for the guests . Coffee hour in the mornings also . Room ##s were a bit small but had everything you needed and were clean . But hey I didn ’ t go to Chicago to spend time in my hotel room . Would stay here again in a heartbeat ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I travel to Chicago frequently for pleasure and business and decided to try this hotel since it was close to my meetings and I wanted to try a bout ##ique hotel . I was pleasant ##ly surprised by the high quality of the accommodation ##s and extra little details like the evening happy hour and easy text ##ing with the staff about things like room service and changes to the bill . I had a late check - out because of the timing of my business meetings and enjoyed the coffee and breakfast on my hotel floor as I worked in my room . Compared to surrounding hotels , it was lower cost and higher quality . My only criticism is that the bed was slightly lump ##y . I will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you ' re ever visiting Chicago , you must stay here . It ' s close to everything you want to visit in the downtown area . Many wonderful restaurants and places to have drinks . People are very friendly . Wonderful stores for shopping . Easy access to transportation anywhere downtown . Chris and D ##wayne were really helpful . En ##joy ##ed our three days there . Hope to visit again soon . Thank you . : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Frank ##ly , at some point it feels like a " tourist trap " you expect from s ##hady hotels that only disc ##lose true benefits of your stay once you are already booked . For this hotel type some things should not even be an issue as they are ease ##ntial ##ly " a given " . For example , you don ##t have an access to the gym as a customer and have to pay extra . You also get water in your room only on the 1st day . Breakfast is not included . Yes , it is clean , great location , and staff is f ##rin ##dly , but isn ' t this what you expect from this type of hotel anyway ##s , especially for the price . That being said , we stayed only half of the planned stay and moved to H ##ya ##t as all those amenities above are included in the price , and yes , it is clean and staff is also friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent four nights here at hated to leave . Quiet comfortable room and friendly staff . Orange / Lemon in ##fused water always available and coffee in the morning . Wine every night at 5 . Central ##ly located with easy access to subway ##s and only short walk from Millennium Park or Miracle Mile . My new go to place in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of the elevators was broken so it took forever to get to any floor , not much available as far as compliment ##ary dining , t ##v service kept cutting out , and the hotel store was pretty p ##ric ##y . For over $ 1 , 000 for a 4 night stay . Not a very good value . Staff was very friendly and my room had a f ##abulous view of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I went to the BS ##B concert and it was a perfect place to stay ! ! Service , clean ##liness , and location top notch ! ! You cannot beat the view when staying at this hotel . We had dinner at Shaw ’ s before hand and it was so close to the hotel ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] King - size bedroom . Small ##er room & smaller bathroom than most hotels I ’ ve seen . Room ##s are well - maintained . No coffee pot in room but typical snack / drink bar out on counter . . . too easy of access to those $ $ snack ##s if there were kids in room . No fridge except mini fridge filled with $ $ items for sale in room . . . not locked . The bed was comfortable and no strong odor ##s which many older hotels have . W ##i - fi is not included unless you are a Hilton Honors member which we are but the faster internet in rooms is an extra $ 15 / day . Just an ok hotel experience . G ##al that checked us in was very nice . We are at in - house restaurant x 3 and none were noteworthy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got to the city early and I didn ' t expect to get a room at 10 : 00 am I was just going to store my bags and go on my way . The girl at the counter was very helpful and got me a room ! The hotel is very nice with a restaurant and a bar , The room was clean and modern , You are right by Water Tower Place and you are just a block or so off of Michigan Ave where there is great shopping . The next morning we got up and stored our bags again and off we went and enjoyed the city . I would stay here again very nice place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el on Chicago ’ s Ma ##g Mile is fantastic . Located within walking distance of everything , but you may not want to leave for anything ! Vanessa at reception was amazing . I regret not getting everyone else ’ s names because the level of service and hospitality shown by the rest of the team - house ##keeping , restaurant , front desk - is exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visited the hotel bar during lunch time . I was really pleased with Mi ##che ##al ' s and Po ##ncia ##no ' s hospitality . Despite the fact that it was busy , they both worked as a team and handled the lunch rush with ease and smile . I appreciated that they kept me entertained and I noticed that other customers were taken care of too . It is nice to see right people at right places . I enjoyed the fruit water in the lobby . It is such a good idea . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Conrad for a training related to work , and the service was top - notch , as was the quality of the food ( and straw ##berry - b ##asi ##l - in ##fused and cu ##cum ##ber - lime - c ##ila ##nt ##ro - in ##fused water ! ) The rooms are switch - less - - you control lights and curtains with push - buttons , and I appreciated this modern touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for business in June for a few days . Overall a decent hotel but definitely not up to Fair ##mont standards . The good : location - pretty much everything is walking distance . Nice central location close to lots of great food , bars , and tourist spots . Service - everything from the front desk , room service , con ##cier ##ge , bell ##man , etc . Even let me check in way early . Order ##ed room service and the food was del ##ish and arrived quick . Ex ##pen ##sive but del ##ish . The not so good : hotel wasn ’ t horrible but the property is looking pretty tired . Bath ##room didn ’ t look clean because lots of the fixtures are old , stained , cracked , etc . I paid over $ 600 a night which is robbery for the state of the property . You can find better hotels for cheaper . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just returned from an awesome trip to Chicago and stayed at this wonderful hotel ! Antonio , the door ##man , really made our trip awesome . He suggested many things to see and do in the short time we were there . Stephanie , at the front desk , was also awesome ! Love ##d the hotel and the window seat ! Was on the 14th floor with a lovely view of the river and Marina City . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will return to the Monaco because of the nice hotel and location ! ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 2 nights at the Ki ##nz ##ie for a business trip . Great location , friendly and helpful staff , LA ##R ##GE room and the continental breakfast was perfect ! I will definitely stay here again for business or pleasure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time in Chicago and I couldn ' t have found a better location ! This hotel sits just a few blocks from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , a ##ND convenient ##ly located near many tourist attractions or easy access to the L train . We had a room on the 6th floor with a beautiful view of the city . The rooms were a good size , modern and very clean . I loved the convenience of having the continental breakfast on each floor . There was enough variety to get you fed , coffee and out the door for the day . The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful , available to answer all of your questions . We decided to park in a garage nearby and that was a bit of a nightmare , but certainly not the fault of the hotel . I would definitely make this my " go to " hotel for any future Chicago trips [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed through Price ##line and yes we thought we were getting a 4 . 5 Star hotel . Hope ! After calling the front desk 10 times finally someone answered and told me the rooms do not have a USB port . How can a 4 . 5 Star hotel NO ##T have a us ##b port in the room ? As I ' m laying here in our bed , in our room , my thoughts are how in the b ##lee ##p is this bed a 4 . 5 Star bed . I feel like I ' m at a Mo ##tel 6 and they didn ' t leave the light on for me . It literally feels like a slap of wood . No cu ##sh ##y feeling in this bed . I ' m not sure how So ##fit ##el gets the 4 . 5 rating but it ' s so ##oo ##o not ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our experience at the Conrad in Chicago . The rooms are spacious and extremely comfortable . And the hotel staff is very helpful and professional . We love that the hotel is central ##ly located and Has all the bells and whistle ##s that a 5 - star hotel should have . they go above and beyond at every given opportunity . Also , we loved and that there is a rooftop Lounge and that the main lobby is on the 20th . It gave us a great van ##tage point of of the city [SEP]
1	[CLS] I like this hotel so much . Traditional and creative design . Morning coffee is free , delicious . Around here , downtown is very nice . I suggest you to go walk around with Digital Camera . There are some shops that you can eat breakfast at early morning ( like Star ##backs , Yo ##lk . ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay . We were given an upgrade for a min fee and had great views . The staff is extremely polite and helpful . The gym is very well equipped . I recommend this hotel for all kind of travellers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived well before check in and to my surprise the room was available . The staff is amazing . Everyone we encountered was pleasant . The location couldn ’ t be beat . Five minute walk to the John Hancock building and several restaurants . Great space and freshly re ##mo ##del ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a great hotel and made for a great atmosphere for an event . Food was excellent and bed was very comfortable . A good blend of a historical feel with modern twist . Not as much floor space / drawer space as other hotels of comparable price [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed last minute as a change of scenery before flying back to the UK , I was pleasant ##ly surprised by the location and will be back again for a closer look . Small lobby area opens out on the upper floors to a hotel of significant size on the upper floors . I was on a mid floor , on the main corridor close to the lift lobby and expected to hear much foot ##fall from other guests but was pleasant ##ly surprised to get a good nights sleep . Small issue with a pre - booked late check out was resolved on check out by management . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is a great hotel just a 1 / 2 block off of Michigan Avenue . The rooms are comfortable and the staff was very helpful . My only complaint is that air conditioning is not available in the late fall and winter although the room may be hot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hu ##ge hotel in great location , but so far short of top - class amenities . Burger place on River ##walk is little better than a cafeteria . Had extremely limited bar options - - - - not at all con ##du ##ci ##ve to relaxing with friends on a weekend afternoon . Bar in lobby did not open until 4 : 00 . No good dining options . Had to go across the street to Lo ##ew ' s for a decent cup of coffee . Will not be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 7 days , staff friendly and helpful . Great guide on activities in Chicago . Help ##ful with eating places , how to access public transport etc . D ##wayne particularly easy to interact with and he is keen to help . Co ##mple ##mentary tea or coffee is available but there is no tea making facilities in rooms . You have to go to the bar down stairs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had our wedding in Chicago the weekend of May 25th . From initial coordination throughout check - out we had the B ##ES ##T experience . The staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our needs & our guests had nothing but f ##abulous things to say about the hotel . For how nice the hotel is , the price was V ##ER ##Y reasonable . Courtney was a great coordinator , and our 80 + out of town guests felt right at home . Thank you so much for making our wedding weekend easy & perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel . Staff was excellent . Walking distance to lots of sights . Easy access to public transportation . Room ##s were quiet and comfortable . Wish it had a refrigerator that ’ s wasn ’ t full of over price beverages ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was a decent size , but the bathroom was small . We had never stayed where there were platform beds and my first thought was older patrons or anyone with knee problems might have trouble getting up because of how low they are . And they were double not queen . : ( I was told they are up ##dating so hopefully it will be nice ##r in the future . The staff was wonderful and its location is close enough to walk many places ! For now I ' d really rate it 3 1 / 2 stars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about this hotel was positive , but in particular we would like to thank the staff for being so helpful and friendly . A special mention to D ##wayne , an ideal front - of - hotel man to welcome us , and also to the lady who cleaned our room ( Room 160 ##2 from Sep 25 until Oct 2 ) whose name I didn ' t get ( sorry ! ) A perfect location for getting around on foot , literally a minute ' s walk from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and loads of bars and restaurants nearby . We were still discovering new places on our last day , and wish we had stayed longer . The only slight negative was that there was no k ##ett ##le in the apartment for tea / coffee , but not enough of a negative to not give a 5 - star review . Thank you The Talbot ##t ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was absolutely amazing . The staff was pro ##mpt and cu ##rt ##ious . We received a room on the 15th floor , although it was on the backs ##ide , the lights at night were neat to from that high . We had a king size bed room that was quite spacious . The bathroom was amazing and all the " little extra ##s " were top notch . Only a couple blocks from Water Tower / American Girl store . Would highly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel . Well located for my office and the rooms are well appointed and newly renovated . Bed was comfortable and shower was great - strong pressure and hot hot water . G ##ym was great too . Nice equipment including p ##elo ##ton bike and lots of pieces . Bar was busy every evening and worth having a drink at . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice location - good views over the river if you ' re on the right side of the building . We had a great view from the 7th floor . I would imagine that the higher floors ( 40 + I believe ) would have a great view of the Navy Pier , but miss the river activity which was very entertaining . Good size rooms and bath with tub and separate shower . Love ##ly house ##keeping staff . Easy check ##out and departure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , close to everything . Room ##s are surprisingly spacious for a city centre and very very quiet . Us ##ual Kim ##pton re ##fine ##ments - gold ##fish included . Bed ##s and bathroom ##s great . Too ##k a while to get a cab booked for the next day - but there was a strike - otherwise really good service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We held our business meeting at the Swiss ##ote ##l this week for approximately 300 people . All attendees enjoyed their stay at the hotel . The rooms , event center , and food was excellent . The best part was the overall service from everyone who works here . Thank you for the experience ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment I stepped out of my taxi until the moment I left , I had the best experience at the Conrad . The employees were g ##en ##uin ##ly smiling and they had a wonderful sense of customer service and even remembered my requests from the day before . The room was spacious with lots of small details I appreciated - from the drinks in the fridge , to the light settings , many places to charge my phone , i ##pad , watch etc , really com ##fy slip ##pers and bath ##robe . Good value for my money as well . Since it was my first time in Chicago I also realized quickly how well - located this hotel was . Right location for the lots of great restaurants and fun stores on Chicago ' s version of " 5th Ave " ! This hotel is a keeper ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is nice and in a very good location . The food at the restaurants is good . However , I had an employee walk in my room at 2 ##am . Bar ##ely an apology and still no explanation as to why the employee walked in my room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everyone knows that if you want an excellent probability that everything is going to be " perfect " then you can count on the O ##m ##ni , regardless of where you are , or so has been my experience over the past 18 years . The Chicago O ##m ##ni is a great place to stay and convenient ##ly located for great shopping and restaurants ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was very nicely decorated for the holidays and we showed up just in time for their Saturday happy hour which was nice . Lots of people gathered and felt very f ##estive . Our room had no view but were told we would have one so it was disappointing . The room was small and so was the bathroom . They do send you a text to see how everything is going and I shared my concern but nobody responded . Other than this the hotel is close to a lot of main attractions Chicago has to offer . I love k ##im ##pton properties but this one was just ok . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent venue for our annual Chicago mini reunion weekend . The Food and Bar service met all of our expectation . The hotel is located in the perfect location for city activities . Our group would definitely come back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a old but fresh hotel that provides a excellent room with good service . I enjoy the Irish Pub for its food and drink and the Grand ballroom is one go the best venues there is in the US . for its beauty and el ##egan ##ce . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I just think Miss ##y at the front desk was incredible . Fast problem solve ##r , di ##ligent and accurate . We need more Miss ##y ' s in this world . My room was clean and cool , great views of the city and Miss ##y hand ##pic ##ked it for me ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] perfect location , beautiful rooms - very clean , updated , and spacious with floor to ceiling windows and a fantastic city view . Easy walk to many sights as well as transportation . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] this was a totally forget ##table experience . The property is small , run down and not worth the prices they charge . Find another place . The West ##in is only a block away . Service staff is friendly and efficient enough , but check - in is a bear . Bottom line : in a service industry , this place just does not rate . Find another place . there are plenty of them in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conferences , and once I got my room all was well - room was spacious , pool was nice , and the City view was also nice . My only complaint was that I arrived at noon to try to check in early , fully understanding that my room right not be ready until the actual check - in at 4 ##pm . I ended up having to wait until 6 : 30 t get my room , with no word of explanation or apology for what took so long . But , again , the room itself was very nice and the location was very convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was small but clean , comfortable bed , staff very friendly . Some advice : don ' t give them your checking account info via a de ##bit card ! They pre - charge you for any " extra ##s " you might use and then re ##fu ##nd you if you don ' t have extra charges when you check out . Was shocked to see almost $ 500 . 00 come out of my bank account when we got home . We got our money back but I didn ' t appreciate waiting 2 days for it to appear on my bank balance ! There must be a better way to make sure people don ' t rip them off for all the " extra ##s " ( drinks , snack ##s , etc . ) they put in your fridge . Also . . . use spot ##her ##o . com to find parking in the area . We only had to pay $ 20 . 00 / night for a spot 2 blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker before X ##mas . Great experience . Staff at front desk check in was quick and our room was ready so able to check in early . Had drinks and snack ##s at the bar . All was good . Great service . Had a piano player in the evening . Room was smaller but well appointed . It ’ s a beautiful historic hotel . Lo ##bby with all the decorations was very f ##estive . Would stay again . Great location [SEP]
0	[CLS] Any ##time you stay somewhere they ask if you have any special requests and I did . I ' m all ##ergic to feathers so I always ask for foam pillows . No problem I ' m told . Come to our room tonight to find feather pillows . I call guest services . It ' s been 45 min and It ' s almost midnight and I am exhausted and want to go to bed . This is far from customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our first stay at this hotel in Chicago for a weekend of dining and entertainment . I would highly recommend this property for a bout ##ique hotel with pleasant staff , great location and very eclectic room de ##cor , especially 13 and 14 floors . Nice restaurant and bar with good raw bar and cocktail ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] pro ' s : assisted and delivered packages to my room . security was ever - present ; almost over - z ##eal ##ous . hotel location con ' s : rooms are dated . would like microwave in room . would like scale to check baggage weight prior to flight . would like shuttle to and from airport . no room service . only one eating area within a two building layout . limited staff , appeared over ##ex ##tended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay here every November for a conference and it ' s the best hotel I stay at all year . The rooms are always perfect , the staff is great , and the location can ' t be beat . A walk or short U ##ber ride will get you to most prominent things you ' ll want to see for a short stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room on smaller size but the common lounge areas and Art Dec ##o de ##cor and am ##bian ##ce makes up for it . High ##ly recommend it ! Beautiful bar and restaurant next door is accessible so you don ’ t need to go outside . Another beautiful bar and restaurant ! Staff very persona ##ble . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Second time we stay here and we like it very much . Staff was friend ##lier this time and the room was great - until we found that the shower had not been cleaned properly and one of the walls was filled with stuck hair from who knows who . We will stay here again but more efforts should be placed in cleaning bathroom ##s better [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing views from our very clean and spacious room ! The host was welcoming and helpful . Location is prime , within easy walk to everything : Mill ##ini ##um Park , Art institute , Michigan Ave shopping and restaurants , river walks , lake front , and many other attractions ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I took my teenage daughter and her best friend for a girls shopping trip and they loved this hotel . It is gorgeous and of course great for self ##ies . The people who work here were more than a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They were always checking in to make sure we were good . I highly recommend this hotel even for just one night ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved Chicago , many things to see and not enough time . Make sure you stay at least a week or more ! Mill ##eni ##um Park was impressive and a great spot to take photographs . It was pretty packed with people so , if you want a great shot , I recommend going as early as you can . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I spent a weekend at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker , we cannot say enough about the Staff , they were at ##ten ##tive and com ##plied with our various requests . From the bar ##man at the ma ##rt ##ini bar to server at the restaurant they provided excellent service . I especially would like to thank T ##iara ( con ##cier ##ge ) , who made sure that the flower , champagne , straw ##berries I order were delivered on time and beautifully arrange ( additionally sent me t ##x ##t to ask how everyone went ) and Craig ( bell ##man ) who you stayed with my wife , while I ran W ##al ##green ##s to get all ##er ##gy medicine . Thank you ! The only improvement I could suggest is up ##dating to the furniture and a new mattress . We will return . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always love staying here . Walk to Mile ##nn ##ium Park , shopping areas , and get great views of the lake . All rooms have incredible views . Worth the price to be able to stay in the heart of everything ! Matt ##resses are firm and windows can be cracked open - I love when I can get some fresh air in a hotel ! Very large and spacious rooms - tub and separate shower , walk - in closet . Only thing missing is a pool or hot tub ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for the N ##RA show and there were three other large conferences at the same time . It should have felt crowded but it didn ' t . Front desk staff was awesome ( shout out to Tom ! ) . Room looked like it was recently re ##mo ##del ##ed and was beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The property ' s New ##er feel , well app ##ort ##ioned rooms , friendly staff and compliment ##ary w ##if ##i , cocktail ##s , and breakfast make the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel a great pick for any Chicago stay . High ##ly recommended . Will definitely stay here again . Can ' t beat the te ##rri ##fic river north location either ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We got stuck in Chicago during a storm and had to spend the night there . The only Hotel with available rooms was the Hilton and the available rooms were some del ##uxe rooms so needles ##s to say they were really luxury and spacious and clean . The Lo ##bby is amazing and it ' s a must see Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for the location which was great . Con ##s : Bath ##tub was dirty , coffee in room was not rest ##ock ##ed , unknown alarm goes off in room at 2 a . m . on more that one night of my stay . Fe ##lt like i would have to beg if i wanted something . Maybe Gold members or what ever point system members are would be treated better . Hotel seems entitled due to location convenience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful lobby and inviting staff . Check - in was efficient . Room was modern and clean , with lots of amenities . Just what you would expect from So ##fit ##el . Lo ##bby bar was trend ##y with lots of options and a great cocktail list . Location just blocks from John Hancock , Water Tower and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile was ideal . Lots of fantastic restaurants close by , all within walking distance . One of my best stays in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Another great So ##fit ##el experience . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located , beautifully appointed and excellent staff . The room was exceptional and the hotel has a beautiful lounge and outdoor patio . Staff is very welcoming and some members speak English , French and Spanish [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed only one night here as we were attending a function downtown . While situated in a very convenient spot , we think that the place needs some up ##dating as some of the premises look a bit worn . Though being top level travelers , we were not offered anything special at the hotel . People were nice and pleasant and rooms were clean . We were quite surprised at the inability to get a night cap at the only bar in the building after 1 am . Come on , this is Chicago , not P ##eor ##ia ! We think the hotel is a convenient convention hotel or corporate event oriented stay . Park ##ing is also outrage ##ously priced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Due to a convention I stayed at this hotel for five night . The room was nice , big , comfortable and had a great view to the Ferris Wheel on the Navy peninsula . Each night was 155 , but I am not sure if this is a normal price or a special price that the convention got . Two things bring the review down : One star minus for having to pay 17 USD for 24 hours of internet access , when every cheap motel has that for free . One star down for the likewise high prices for breakfast where b ##uff ##et costs 33 USD , tips included . It is , however possible to buy coffee and some plastic - wrapped items in a convenience store inside the hotel . The only place for dinner inside the restaurant was the Shu ##la ' s steak house . Excellent beef , but oh so expensive ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hi stayed at all ##egro a few weeks ago with my husband and we were already stressed and tired from our flight in , it was also my birthday . Anyway , the front desk girl , br ##ige ##tte , was super amazing . She asked us how we were doing and i just ran ##ted about the horrible flight , she listened to us and asked us if there was anything she could do to help . and she told us about the prose ##cco hour but we had just missed it by a minute , so she was so sweet that she told us to wait for a minute , went and got us a glass of prose ##cco for my husband and i to just get comfortable and relax . It was such a small gesture but very very nice of her ! She later recommended us the spots to go visit while we were in ch ##ica ##go ! I give it 5 stars because of how at home she made us feel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] N ##uff said . Really nice facility . Great location . Staff was amazing . Total ##ly worth your time and your business ! Made our stay in Chicago even better . Got us all the deals and details for all the sights in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel in a great location ! This was our 3rd time at this property and we will be back ! Park ##ing and Breakfast package is excellent ! Next time I would like to try a corner suite ! The hotel staff is great with kids . . . . loved the milk and cookies ! Wish they did it every night ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a quick weekend trip to Chicago to visit family . Previously I had stayed at the Conrad but it had been years ago . I was not aware that this property was a different one than where I had stayed previously ( previous Conrad closed or moved to this location ) . To put it simply , I couldn ' t have been more impressed . The location is perfect and the employees were wonderful ! The room ( 14th floor - double beds ) was spacious for Chicago . The furnishings were excellent . We also enjoyed room service ( dessert ) both nights and were pleasant ##ly surprised at how delicious they were and how quickly the food arrived . I have definitely found my new favorite place to stay in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Loves this hotel . . . the atmosphere was great and it had everything I needed on sight . Great view of the lake as well . The conference was laid out very well , did not feel like we were crowded into our space . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very space ##ous hotel with kind person ##el in the middle of downtown activity ! Date ##d rooms but convenient . Clean but not perfectly . . . . Breakfast is ok and busy in early hours . Walking distance from the M ##M ##ile and club scene . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s my second time at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal . The staff are always superb and the location is close to so many things . It ' s price ##y , but I guess in line with the surrounding area . It ' s just a short walk to dozens of eat ##eries and shopping places . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is so comfortable and modern and elegant . We had a room suite . The room was nice and clean . The suite was comfortable . The food at the P ##ump Room was amazing . The photos of the celebrities are really interesting ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Older hotel convenient off of the Lake Shore Drive . Man ##dan ##a in the Ex Lounge was outstanding . The e ##pit ##ome of customer service . Car parking was not . No one answered the phone then waited 15 min ##s for someone to become available . Quiet enough hotel . Better choices in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the hospitality , de ##cor and location . They surprised with a c ##ele ##bra ##tory cake upon our arrival . The beds were comfortable , the suites were quiet and the location was perfect for us . We were able to travel to meetings easily and really enjoyed the bar to . Great service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got to town and when checking in we were offered an upgrade at a nominal fee . Park / Lake view from the 30th floor . Great view . Room large , bed comfortable , house keeping on top of things . Staff very friendly and inform ##ative . En ##joy ##ed the stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were not impressed with this particular So ##fit ##el Hotel in Chicago . The room was rather dark , the bed a little too soft and uneven . The service at Le Bar was slow and $ 35 . 00 for two water ##ed down cocktail ##s ? Please . That ' s ridiculous . Overall , it was just fine . Not excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quality of food was terrible ! I also requested room away from elevators but the request was completely ignored . I wouldn ' t stay here going forward . . . . . . . . . . . . many other nice places to stay on Michigan avenue . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a weekend in January 2017 . Our stay was get ##away . The hotel is convenient ##ly located for the activities we had planned and also for some good dining and evening activities . The staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I am not originally from Chicago and the parking is insane to me . The hotel parking is $ 65 a day . Overall a good stay . We would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment I was greeted at the front desk I was treated like royalty . B ##re and her staff accommodate ##d my every need . I feel they actually went above and beyond the call of duty ! When I requested some items for my room and my daughter ’ s room , L . A . and José quickly delivered . I just love the quiet , comfortable v ##ibe of the Ambassador and the location is ideal for me . I always look forward to walking the lake ##front . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I only stayed for two nights at this historic property , but I am greatly looking forward to returning again soon . First , I ' d like to acknowledge the front office at this hotel , what an amazing team . All were educated , friendly , and approach ##able . I also must say the property was well kept , and my only regret is not getting a chance to swim the Olympic pool ! The Michael Jordan restaurant was delicious , and I look forward to coming back again even on leisure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One night on a recent business trip . Excellent room , upgraded without asking , nice lounge although only cold breakfast . Re ##com ##men ##d this property . General She ##rato ##n and SP ##G quality . Good night ##life at the bar and attached restaurant as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room setup is great for families and those who want the option of cooking . G ##ro ##cer ##y stores are not far away . Some basic issues with bathroom , smells , but not to the point it couldn ' t be fixed . However , can tell hotel is starting to have wear and tear . That doesn ##t bother as much but clean ##liness , working order becomes priority which was not as satisfactory . Staff was in general very helpful . Breakfast was generally good though their meat ##s tend to be bath ##ed in oil . Love that they have large TV in the bedroom and living room . Location of hotel is great . . . less than 2 blocks from c ##ta and same block as eat ##aly . . . great for grocery , dessert ##s , a meal ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is comfortable and nice . The customer service is much better at McDonald ’ s . When I made my reservation I requested two beds in my room but when I arrived they said that it would be an extra $ 75 for a room with two beds . Then I asked if we can have a late check out on the phone and they said 1 PM is the latest and rude ##ly hung up the phone . Overall , I will be sure to never stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So friendly from the door ##men to the front desk to the room service people . The hotel was lovely . We had a Group ##on . Unfortunately , we picked a weekend where it rain ##ed all weekend . Luckily , they are about 2 blocks to Water Tower Place and located close to everything . My 11 year old enjoyed the pool and room service was quick . No free w ##i - fi and out ##ta had a very difficult time keeping a signal . It might have been because of the weather . Also there was a really weird - c ##reak ##ing sound throughout the night . The only thing I can think of is that the wind was traveling through the walls . I ' m not sure what it could have been . The rooms were im ##ma ##culate and I would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Dar ##lin and I had to make a rush trip to Chicago and need a place to stay . Of course there were meetings and conventions gal ##ore and so our usual ha ##unts were fully booked . We were able to get in to the Monaco , and we are glad we did . The booking and check in was absolutely pain free ; and on arrival the staff was friendly and very helpful . Vale ##t parking was less expensive than many places and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Our room was on the front of the hotel with deep window seats made for curling up with a book ( or in my case a computer ) . The room was well appointed and clean . The beds were comfortable and the the ##rm ##ost ##at actually worked and let the room get down as cool as we like . I don ' t g ##ush over hotels but will say that I really , really liked it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed three nights in a one bedroom suite overlooking the city and Navy Pier . We also paid to use the She ##rato ##n Club for breakfast and night ##time snack ##s . That was a very good value . The Club also over ##look ##s the lake , river , and city - beautiful view . Every employee we came in contact with really seemed to enjoy their position at the She ##rato ##n . It was a very enjoyable experience and look forward to staying again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to a show — the theater was literally right next door — and ate at the adjoining restaurant . Food was excellent and staff at the hotel wonderful . The rooms are an art de ##co 20 ##s style and sum ##pt ##uous . It was a f ##abulous weekend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel in the perfect location with easy access to all things Chicago . The rooms are not gigantic , but no Chicago hotel room is . They are exceptionally clean and well maintained . Room service was hot and on time . The room windows include black out shades which is ideal in a city that never sleep ##s . There ' s a great Star ##bu ##cks right off the lobby , too . C ##ab ##s are out front ready to go . What ' s not to like ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and I stayed at this hotel ( which we ’ ve stayed at before and love ! ) in December . She ’ s a college student in Chicago so we left a bag with the hotel and spent her break in Colorado with the rest of our family . When she came back on her own to pick up the bag ( the rest of us live overseas so we were gone by then ) , she forgot her bag ticket . But Wayne and Kay were incredibly helpful and g ##rac ##ious , and remembered my daughter ! They stored her bag for the entire time and made sure nothing happened to it even though she was a few days late on picking it up . Great hotel with great staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was amazing - beautiful - perfect location ! Staff was great from check in to directions . A ##ble to find few great local bars & breakfast spots . . . to watch T ##hur ##s night / pre - birthday bears - pack ##ers . . . easy walk to the navy pier , architectural boat cruise was just out three back door of or hotel & can ' t leave out the easy s ##tro ##ll to get to red line for cu ##bs game ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice to be outside of the downtown he ##ctic loop and massive hotels . Very clean rooms and excellent service . Lou ##d doors to rooms ( slamming ) and daytime construction made sleeping and working harder than it should be for business trips . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Visiting Chicago to check out colleges , we wanted a hotel central ##ly located to check out the entire city . The Ki ##nz ##ie is perfect ! Plus , it is spot ##less , comfortable bed , great breakfast on each floor and great value . P ##lent ##y of great restaurants within a minute walk . T ##ip - they have a lounge open 5 - 8 ##pm , but no view . G ##rab a drink and head to your room - all with a good view ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What amazing staff . The Front Des ##k made switching rooms , splitting bills , etc very easy . They anticipated our needs and took care of everything . A total class experience . Being referred by the Con ##cier ##ge ' s Staff helped in getting reservations and by passing hour long line ups in the restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel All ##egro in Chicago was hub of stay for guests of recent wedding . Hotel staff ( especially Erin M ) were most welcoming , helpful & professional . . . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tion was lovely . . . room very updated , clean & most com ##fy bed . Hotel has several informal , inviting gathering areas / lounge ##s which provided perfect spaces to meet up with friends & family who were likewise attending the wedding . I also much appreciated that the hotel welcome ##s pets as arrangements for care of my dog ( in my MI home ) were cancelled at the last minute so Duncan ( my C ##ava ##lier ) also enjoyed our hotel stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Class ##y hotel on an excellent location . Space ##ous rooms and hallway ##s , excellent service . Service and quality according to room rate . Columbus tap is a nice bar , but lo ##bb ##u bar s ##hou ##ls also be opened most of the time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at his hotel many times and there are many reasons that bring me back . The location is excellent as it is close to shops and restaurants . The hotel restaurant is very good as is Le ##B ##ar which has a great bar menu and a fun new de ##cor . The rooms are very nice and the beds are really just crazy comfortable ! Like sinking into a cloud . But really the best thing about this hotel are the people who work there . From the v ##alet who parks your car to the manager of the hotel and everyone in between , the staff at the So ##fit ##el do everything they can to make you feel welcome and help you with any needs you may have . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l a few times . Both times I ' ve had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan . I ' d highly recommend spending the few extra dollars for the upgrade . The only real thing I found odd about the room is there wasn ' t a hair dry ##er . Additionally , it took 24 hours for the room to cool down . When I arrived it was 74 inside . The lowest you can adjust it to is 65 . Twelve hours after check ##in , it was only down to 72 . Park ##ing here is a bit difficult . You can pay in advance online , but you actually park next door . Park ##ing there is T ##IG ##HT , so just a heads up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On Tuesday , August 21 , 2018 I was sent to this Swiss ##ote ##l by Amtrak and I want to thank De ##met ##rie for his wonderful and pleasant service when checking into this hotel . Also , I did not get the name of the gentleman outside at the front door in the morning but again . . . wonderful and pleasant service . Thank you De ##met ##rie and " unknown " bell ##man ! ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was amazing and so was the experience ! We stayed for a girls weekend for my grandmother ##s birthday and they exceeded my expectations . The rooms were comfortable and clean upon arrival . I ’ ll definitely be returning and recommend ##ing them ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a good stay in the Public for 4 nights but the place lacks personality . When we arrived the reception ##ist told us there was a big wedding going on over the weekend . Thank god we were jet la ##gged because we had a room just above the party ##ing and were bouncing in our bed one of the nights . The hotel staff is not really bothered with any clients . They just seem part of the de ##cor but are not adding to the story . Most of them don ' t even say a word or even great you when you enter or leave . Anyone can just walk in or out . No - one is checking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is extremely clean . The staff are lovely . The rooms have such an amazing view . You will Not regret staying here . The hotel is located near many restaurants . There is a c ##v ##s right around the corner . On the lower level there is a Du ##nk ##in Don ##uts and other stores . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed the Palmer because of it ' s historic presence . Our stay did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . The staff was very friendly and the room classic and clean . There is something to be said for staying at a hotel that has such a history . We ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] we had a couple issues with our reservation however the front desk manager managed it smoothly . As a party of 7 we asked for ad ##join ##t rooms and even though the hotel was packed they were able to make it despite a couple twists . . . excellent location and value , close to whatever you may want to do downtown & around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed the hotel ! It is located in a very good location ! ! I would like specially mention from Man ##dan ##a , a very kind waitress at breakfast in the 15 floor . She was really good and kind with us , thank you ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time and last time at this hotel . Stay ##ing at the Conrad for one week . Will not extend check out for a couple of hours without additional charges . Hospital ##ity and business - minded people would have not blinked at such a request . It is always done everywhere I stayed no matter what the circumstances are ! Hope they maintain their clients with such “ ho ##sp ##ita ##ble ” practice . Manager would not leave his / her desk to address the issue . It is not about the money , it is about the attitude ! Hospital ##ity is an art . Obviously , it does not exist here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I know this review is really late but I remember this hotel like it was yesterday . Is how to be one of the most beautiful hotels that we stood at . We were on the 24th floor with a beautiful view of Michigan Lake and all of downtown . I know if I go back to Chicago I ' m staying at the same Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff from entrance to interior . This was my first time staying at an O ##m ##ni . The staff were very friendly & at ##ten ##tive from entrance to interior . Clean & perfect for business . Close to many restaurants & shopping . Love the express check out straight from your phone . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I met in Chicago after a business trip of mine - we had a fantastic experience at the Talbot ##t Hotel . The staff is very friendly and helpful . The cleaning staff does a fantastic job and they are very polite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The details of this hotel are gorgeous . El ##eva ##tors , seating , mirrors , and lighting are spectacular . Would have loved to have a drink in the lobby . Stay was affordable with the exception of parking . Room ##s were small , but bed was comfortable and shower worked well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were greeted curb ##side upon check in by Am ##er who directed traffic to help us park . He g ##rac ##iously un ##loaded all our luggage with a smile . Every time we passed through the lobby Am ##er welcomed us . He had our car ready at curb ##side at the exact time as promised . He wishes us farewell by giving my 5 year old son a small pizza to enjoy for the ride home . What a g ##em ! This hotel was im ##ma ##culate and clearly customer service was their priority . It was central ##ly located within walking distance of all the the hot spots in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always a wonderful stay when we are in Chicago . Located where we need to be within the city . Close to us for shopping and easy for us to drive to see our daughter . Would not stay any other hotel in Chi [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently arrived at hotel Monaco in Chicago ( with my son to look at law schools ) with a freshly broken ankle in a plastic s ##p ##lint and on c ##ru ##tches . . . quite painful and slow going , the making ##s of the worst trip ever ! but the staff at the hotel Monaco - particularly the port ##ers and door ##men - were incredibly kind and helpful so that getting in and out ( and in and out u ##bers and cab ##s ) was a breeze . . . the room was , of course , wonderful . . . as was everything else about the hotel . . but it was the kindness of the staff that made this trip ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was located right in the heart of Chicago . It was clean and staff was extremely friendly / helpful . There is plenty to do in the hotel if you don ' t want to go out in the cold . The room was spacious and had all the amenities I needed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A charming historic hotel . So much fun to stay there . Even if you are not staying there though , walk through the lobby and be da ##zzle ##d by the Art Dec ##o interior . Great service and we had a lovely room . There is a bar in the lobby with perfect am ##bian ##ce for a unique cocktail , or dessert . We wanted to get the famous Palmer House brown ##ies , but each day they were sold out when we got around to it . So have a better strategy than we did in order to score a brown ##ie ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed a standard room for birthday weekend . Staff upgraded us to a lake view room and sent a bottle of champagne to our room because it was a special occasion for us . Thanks so much ! Room was always spot ##less , the con ##cier ##ge was helpful and polite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were checked into the hotel by J ##ac ##lyn who was welcoming , friendly and down to earth . As we chat ##ted I mentioned it was my birthday and asked if an upgrade might be possible . She was quick to put us into a f ##abulous room overlooking Navy Pier with access to the work ##out room on the top floor with a s ##tu ##pen ##do ##us view . The bed was very comfortable and the room clean and well appointed . J ##ac ##lyn was in the lobby in the morning with a smile asking after our well - being . J ##ac ##lyn is a perfect representation of a wonderful hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed for business - the hotel was clean and comfortable and convenient to everything I needed to get to . What really stood out , though , was the friendly , helpful staff . Everyone I encountered was enthusiastic and pleasant , and made it a point to see how they could make the stay better . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My amazing July 2017 weekend in Chicago was pu ##nc ##uated by the glorious So ##fit ##el hotel . My husband and I wanted to be near the lake , but al ##s ##ó right in the middle Of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . The shopping , the walks along Michigan A ##v was everything we had expected . And when we returned to the hotel á ##t night , á ##ll weary and tired from the day ' s j ##aunt ##s , the bed , bed ##ding was just like floating on a cloud , all float ##y , soft and rest ##ful . So peaceful ! When we checked out , I immediately inquired about where i could purchase the same comfort ##ers , sheets , and pillows for my own home . The staff was very court ##eous and helpful . Can ##t wait to visit there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the time we arrived until we left , every aspect of our visit was excellent . The location is perfect right off Michigan Avenue allowing easy access to anything you might want . My wife and I stayed in a regular room with two double beds . The rooms are exceptional , very clean , with plenty of room . There is plenty of storage and plenty off room to move around . The bathroom ##s are very spacious , well laid out and very clean . This will be our go to hotel moving forward when we come into the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I find the She ##rato ##n brand to be hit - or - miss : they can be great or just so - so . But this hotel was very nice in all ways . The staff was friendly and always helpful , the location is right downtown and near many things to do , and the views of Lake Michigan are very stunning . I found food in the con ##cier ##ge lounge to be very ta ##sty . I ' d recommend this hotel to anyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great deal this place is ! ! ! It has super central location , very room ##y suites ( paying little extra for city view is so worth it ) , very friendly employees , indoor swimming pool on rooftop , great breakfast , light dinner 5 - 7 ##pm Mon - T ##hur . Everyone that works there seems to be on top of their game and knows exactly what they are doing . In such great city and with all those amenities for around $ 200 a night - stop your search now , this is it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is the best . Very close to shopping and fine din ##ning . Great place to start your walk to the Chicago River and all the shops along Michigan Ave . The staff is professional and knowledge ##able . The pan ##de ##mic has made a few of the amenities to be closed temporarily but will re ##ope ##n soon . The bell ##man are top notch and can help with everything from bags to where to get a great breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Normally when you book a room on a discount site or through a travel site You hear warnings about how you will not be treated well by the hotel staff because they know where you booked your room through or that if they ’ re over ##book ##ed you ’ ll be the first one to get bumped things like that . We booked our reservation on Group ##on and we were treated so wonderful ##ly . it was so comfortable , we got a much needed adult time only get ##away from our two gorgeous little children . We were put on the highest floor in the corner room , stunning yet terrifying ##ly high view and it was just so relaxing . We sat by the fireplace in the bar and it was just wonderful . I highly recommend staying there even for just one night . And they are literally one block away from The magnificent mile [SEP]
1	[CLS] perfect location and absolutely fl ##aw ##less stay . Re ##ceived a room on the 38th floor in the executive tower . Perfect service at breakfast , bell boys receiving the cars , while front desk really depends on the associate [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a perfect stay here prior to flying out of O ’ Hare . What a magnificent hotel ! It was fully deck ##ed out with holiday decorations . I love historic hotels , and this is among the best in Chicago . The bar was great for late night snack ##s and drinks also . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in a great place . Just be prepared to pay TO ##P dollar for everything . If you request a re ##f ##ridge ##rator or microwave expect to be charged . Also , visit the little known secret area below the hotel there are various restaurants , salon ##s , Amazon Go , and reasonably priced food . Also , the hotel does not have a pool . . . . . I heard every move my neighbors made . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for one night of spring break . The rooms were very small and in great need of up ##dating . The pool was not kid friendly as it is set up for lap swimming only . You also had to climb down a steep ladder to enter the pool which was another disadvantage . The top ##per was that they charged $ 71 per night to park your car in the hotel garage as a guest . R ##id ##ic ##ulous . I would not stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Bed ##room was very well appointed and the d ##é ##cor was very taste ##ful . A desk to work at and an extra chair added another layer of comfort to the room . Every aspect of your comfort was taken care of with plenty of towels and toilet ##ries in the bathroom . A good coffee machine with pod ##s for tea and coffee which were updated each day . The staff in the Bar were very polite and helpful adding ni ##bble ##s to complement your late afternoon glass of wine as you people watch . The hotel had a welcoming atmosphere from the time you stepped inside . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a wonderful hotel . The hotel is located in a great location . The staff offer great customer service , and great service . The bar is great . Michael Jordan ' s steak ##house is located within the hotel . All attractions are within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In Chicago for a conference , will glad ##ly stay here again . The room was clean and comfortable , with an er ##gon ##omi ##c desk chair , free W ##i ##F ##i , nice robes , efficient coffee ##maker etc ( the only thing I ' d change would be to have some fridge space in the mini ##bar , and a night ##light in the bathroom . ) There ' s a clean , well - equipped fitness center . The location is right on the river , near wonderful restaurants and shopping . And for the truly jet - la ##gged ( I was just coming from California , but my colleagues arrived from Hong Kong and Australia ) the Market in the lobby is open 24 hours ! I always prefer practical , thoughtful details over meaning ##less " l ##ux ##uries " , and H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago is designed for travelers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in the honeymoon sweet when I went and it was beautiful ! Top floor , room looked over the Chicago river . The room had little beds in the window that I used to read a book on . I would recommend anyone to go here . Price ##s are completely reasonable for the atmosphere and room that you get . Staff is amazing ! They have free wine hour on Friday ##s around 6 ##pm too . I thought that was a nice added bonus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ing . com users B ##E ##WA ##RE . Two of us booked and checked in today only to be allocated the most sub standard rooms , either by lifts or plant that was noisy and in ##tr ##usive . They obviously regard booking . com as an inferior consumers . Message to booking . com - your business model is useless if you allow hotels like this to down grade your users to the bottom of the food chain . General message - an el ##itis ##t hotel practicing poor process by just taking a single indicator as di ##ct ##ating your importance - PR ##O ##FI ##T . Super ##fic ##ial and poor , no deeper understanding of consumer loyalty . Anyone with values - ST ##A ##Y A ##WA ##Y ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is part of SP ##G and members enjoy the SP ##G club . The staff are court ##eous and willing to serve the guests . Room ##s are clean . Excellent restaurants and con ##cier ##ge service . The Front Des ##k Manager is a good listener and problem solve ##r . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel had the nice ##st staff ( especially the door ##men ) and the clean ##est rooms . My kids loved the breakfast and begged to go every day . I loved the 15th story view and great location in the loop with nearby shopping and sights . I wish the room were a bit bigger but otherwise it was a perfect fit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel many times but not much in recent years . I arrived late to find the lobby swamp ##ed with a happy bar crowd . The registration desk seems to be more isolated than is used to be , and smaller . I also could not help but notice how worn the carpet was . However , the staff was very friendly and helpful . Feeling some t ##re ##pid ##ation , I took the elevator to my room . W ##he ##w ! I was very relieved to see a nice 4 star room with a state of the art bathroom ! I had to read the directions to figure out the shower ! The hotel did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! Still one of my favorites ! I would suggest they s ##pruce up the registration area . This was a great buy and I will glad ##ly stay again soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed a week with my wife and daughter . The hotel is in a great location with fun atmosphere . W ##E loved the room and the view of the river and lake . The bed was very comfortable and the walls are very quite . Would definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay in Chicago quite a bit for business and have tried other hotels and always come back . The lobby is big air ##y and relaxing . The rooms are clean and quite . This is a updated version of the classic grand hotels . If you enjoy the classic look of marble , wood and large beautiful lobby ' s that takes you back in time a bit . This is a great place The location is top notch too . Lots of architecture to see nearby and good restaurants are easy to walk too . The rooms are comfortable and clean and , if your lucky , over ##look the river . The breakfast b ##uff ##et is great with lots of healthy options . As a business travel ##er I appreciate this . The steak ##house called Shu ##la ' s is good but a bit price ##y for the average guest I would imagine . This is my go to place when I am in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had four nights here and it was a great experience . Having a bit more space in our suite was great just to relax before heading out or first thing on a morning . The location is excellent with everything within walking distance . The staff were all great , particularly the v ##alet and bell ##men who were so friendly , helpful and engaging , especially B ##K . We were served by Martha and Brook in the bar each evening , who were both good and Martha in particular was very engaging and friendly . It ’ s a bit p ##ric ##y for drinks but then so is everywhere in Chicago . The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the quality of the W ##i ##F ##i . Whilst we didn ’ t pay for it as we had joined the Select Guest scheme , I would have been quite upset if I ’ d paid $ 9 . 95 per day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great central River North location , the price reflects the lack of views , I enjoyed the extra space while traveling with my teenage son . The room was clean , comfortable and quiet . Staff was friendly and at ##ten ##tive , check in was quick , the building is secure with key cards required for elevator use . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The o ##m ##ni Chicago is located perfectly on Michigan Ave in the heart of the shopping district . Normally , they are top notch , however at this last visit to Chicago the staff fell far from top notch . New management at the Hotel has definitely reflected lack of training and the inability to identify top patrons . We are normally treated like royalty just not this time . We will have them another chance but not again if they fall short . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel was clean and pleasant and the staff were friendly . Room ##s were generous size , and beds were very comfortable . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed that w ##if ##i wasn ' t free here , though this was the only thing we were disappointed with . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This little g ##em of a hotel is central ##ly located . A few blocks away from shopping , abundant din ##ning options , and all kinds of attractions at a price that is hard to beat . If you are looking for clean accommodation ##s , free W ##i - Fi , free continental breakfast , in the heart of Chicago this hotel will not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] toilet kept stopping up . Ask ##ed to p ##lung ##e several times . The p ##lumber came and the water over ##flow ##ed onto the floor . The shower also kept filling with water . Very noisy but ok when windows were shot . A ##pp ##re ##cia ##ted being able to open wind ##io ##ws and suite . Internet sign up was confusing and bill ##ing had to be resolved ok overall for Chicago center . Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tor rental a plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel and staff were great . Everything was clean , staff was very friendly and helpful with cab ##s and such . It was a much needed relaxing weekend away and will probably return again in the future . A ##wes ##ome hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Palmer House is historic and iconic . St ##un ##ning lobby . V ##isi ##t for the lobby . Hang out in the lobby . Tiny rooms in this classic hotel . Tiny beds in tiny rooms . Dec ##ent W ##i ##F ##i , ok linen ##s . Good location and easy walking distance for art institute and c ##bic heat ##re [SEP]
1	[CLS] It met my expectations . The location was close to the different places we had planned to visit . I enjoyed my stay and if circumstances made sense I would stay there again . Honestly the only out ##lying thing I remember that could have been better but didn ' t make or break my experience is the elevator , just the size of it and one of the times I used it , it had some issues leaving the lobby but other than that everything was fine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m back again ! B ##rough ##t 2 of my friends to stay with me . Had a big Christmas party in the city and made the Ki ##nz ##ie our base ! It exceeded our expectations above and and beyond ! We enjoyed the happy hour before our party and actually had some friends join us who were staying at another city hotel . They were so impressed with the Ki ##nz ##ie that we will all stay there again next year for our annual event . Thank you again for another fine experience . This was my 4th stay at your hotel ( all with different people ) and everyone loved the whole experience each and every time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , great service and great location . Will definitely making another trip back to take advantage of the amenities and restaurant that is opening . Would recommend to anyone for a business or pleasure . It ' s also on the miracle mile . [SEP]
0	[CLS] For the price the hotel room was clean , spacious and absolutely magnificent . Service was very friendly even though I was a first time ##r and probably made a fool of myself . I always felt welcomed and enjoyed my stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel in my opinion is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . . . the rooms are beautiful and clean and they have Excellent Custom ##er Service . They are located directly across the street from T ##ru ##luck ' s Restaurant and a block from Michigan Ave where all the shopping takes place . Also AR ##G ##O tea is right across the street as well . Overall , it was a great stay in a diamond hotel . I look forward to coming back soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C experience with the front desk attendant Mona and Victor were completely FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C . The bartender Matt was amazing as well . Great room & Amazing amenities and Beautiful property . Amazing ! ! I booked the room close to a testing center I had exams at the following day and had a great night rest and was able to walk 5 - 7 min ##s to my exams . Thank you to the A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E Ki ##nz ##ie Staff for making my night stay W ##ON ##DE ##R ##F ##U ##L ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located right across the street from Grant Park , within walking distance of Millennium Park and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It is also a short car ride away from Navy Pier and other attractions . It is a V ##ER ##Y large hotel so I would expect some problems to arise . Our room had two bathroom ##s , which was a huge plus since it was a room full of girls . I did not have much interaction with the staff other than the front desk and maid ##s because I was out of the room most of the day . There is a pub in the hotel , but I did not eat there as it was a little price ##y . Overall , I enjoyed my stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here during our long weekend in Chicago . Location was wonderful . We kept the car in the garage and walked or took the L everywhere . My only complaint was the room was very small . Everything was nice , just very small room . Not a huge deal because we didn ' t spend a lot of time in the room , but be ##ware if you will be . The free cocktail hour was really nice with house wine and local beer available . Beautiful , fun lobby to spend some quiet time in the evening at . Room service was not very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient River North location , we walked almost everywhere and took the free trolley right outside the door to Navy Pier . Great value for families , room ##y suites with free breakfast and social hour M - T ##H . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They charged me $ 300 upon my arrival on my credit card and left the hotel on October 5 and still haven ’ t re ##fu ##nded me the money . Also when I checked out the attendant at the counter was very rude when I asked him about some charged fees . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is located right at the beginning of Chicago ' s " Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile " . It is an older hotel and definitely have the atmosphere of Chicago in the 1920 ' s . It is full of history and you almost expect Al Cap ##one to show up in the lobby . The room was on the smaller side , but very comfortable and clean . The coffee shop off the lobby is a great place for a light meal . All in all I truly enjoyed the stay in this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Extreme ##ly clean hotel & let me check in very early . Great location . No blow dry ##er in the room & shower water pressure is so intense I felt like my nipple ##s were getting cut off , but other than that it ' s great . Ask for a room away from elevators - super loud . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the third time I review this hotel . Once again , excellent . This time we were upgraded to the executive floor and it was fantastic , breakfast included . There are not many options and it ' s always the same food but we appreciated everything . Although we had an issue with the full size bed ( booked one double bed ) because , in my opinion it ' s too small for two people to sleep comfortably . The mattress and pillows help since they are so com ##fy . . . but still too small . We Love ##d the Executive Floor El ##eva ##tor since the other ones are so ##oo ##o slow ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I absolutely recommend this Hotel . The location is perfect , in Michigan Avenue , The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , a few steps from great shops and restaurants , if you go South , one block from Tribune Tower , from Chicago River and the river ##walk , a few blocks from Mill ##eni ##um Park , The Bean , The Art Institute of Chicago , Grant Park , etc . If you go North , pretty good shops , restaurants , Hancock 360 sky deck , The Water Tower , a lot to see around [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has wonderful restaurants in it . The Regency club upgrade to my room offered me additional key ##card security to get onto my hotel room floor and into the club that served breakfast , snack ##s and ho ##rs d ’ o ##eu ##vres . C ##rab cakes , chicken and wild rice soup , meat ##s and cheese ##s and bread ##s and more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is fantastic ! ! The location is great , the staff are welcoming , helpful , and service oriented . The room was clean & comfortable and the amenities are great . The hotel offers very competitive rates , while including complementary Internet and an awesome continental breakfast with a variety of past ##ries , cereal ##s , bag ##els , coffee , tea ##s , and juice ##s . As a bonus , there is a great lounge on the 6th floor that provides a daily spread of anti ##pas ##tos and ho ##r de ##vour ##s as well as cocktail ##s . This is the place to stay when going to Chicago ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A fresh Euro Style accommodation with an excellent bilingual staff , restaurant ( with indoor and outdoor seating ) and a hip bar . Located in the trend ##y North Downtown area of the city just a few steps from Michigan Avenue ( The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ) . It is close to a variety of restaurants and active entertainment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Staff is extraordinary , they were always aware of my family and try to be in contact with them in all the departments as front Des ##k , house ##keeping and food and beverage . The location is good and the Food and beverage service is high quality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very much enjoyed our stay at the So ##fit ##el ! The front desk was super court ##eous ! Nice view out of the window ! Room was clean ! Bath ##room was well lit ##e and clean ! Very much enjoyed our stay ! Two things to be careful about . . . the mini ##bar will automatically charge your account if just simply move stuff around . . . it has sensors in it and as soon as you move anything it charges your account . Also the parking is like $ 71 a night unless you get the Spot ##H ##ero app . . . paid $ 25 for 24 h ##rs ! We had to walk halfway around the block then but we thoroughly enjoyed just walking in Chicago ! Very much enjoyed our trip ! Thanks So ##fit ##el ! Would definitely come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I took a spur of the moment weekend trip and took a chance on this Hotel and I am Happy I did . . . . The staff are amazing , I arrived early not realizing the time change from NY so I arrived even earlier then I expected and the Hotel was able to accommodate me immediately … The rooms are f ##abulous , I ’ m on an upper floor te ##rri ##fic views of the Willis Tower and Lake Michigan … Hotel is very clean and very well - kept . . . is central ##ly located easy access to walk to basically anywhere you want … Public transportation is right down the block … And there is an amazing restaurant right across the street called T ##ru ##luck … I highly recommend this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is ideal ##ly located with easy and safe walking to Michigan Avenue , the river walk , the ' bean ' and dozens of places to eat and drink . The staff is FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C ! They went out of their way to make us comfortable . They arranged a car back to the airport , called and got us dinner reservations made several spot on recommendations etc . I understand that service is their business but their service was above and beyond the line of duty . Well Done ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location . Fair ##mont Gold is so worth it . The staff went out of their way to assist us . From restaurant recommendations to tour experience , they were great ! I would definitely stay there again [SEP]
1	[CLS] My suite overlooked Mill ##eni ##um Park , which was a short walk out the main door . Every inch of the hotel was clean and modern . Friendly , efficient staff at every interaction . Del ##icious food spanning many kinds of cuisine across the length of my conference . Thought ##ful amenities like a light - up makeup mirror and shoe cleaning station really enhanced the room experience . The public lounge areas were also spacious and comfortable to grab a few minutes of laptop or phone work or just to gaze at the city views . A hotel that manages to maintain both a sense of vintage history and g ##ilde ##d modern ##ity that makes for a perfect stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended a conference and was a trade show exhibit ##or at this hotel last week . Pre - arrival offer to add Fair ##mont Gold service was accepted . Fe ##e a bit more than internet service but included exclusive check on 15th floor , luggage delivery , lounge access and lots of com ##p breakfast items , beverages and View . Up ##grade also led to larger corner King room , good working and sitting areas and swing around TV . Like big city downtown hotels , there is a price to pay . Value here though is excellent . They are an Aero ##p ##lan partner too . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Fair ##mont has been a brand of luxury and supreme quality for a long time and my stay at Fair ##mont Chicago has just exceeded all my expectation . It started with warm reception at the front desk . The room was comfortable and spacious with a neat bathroom . Breakfast b ##uff ##et at millennium room was re ##f ##reshing and I would like to highlight the sincerity and hospitality of all waiter ##s and waitress . They served in an approach ##able and professional manner . The close proximity of Fair ##mont Chicago to millennium park , the magnificent mile and Chicago theatre makes my short business trip perfect with sights ##ee ##ing nearby . Overall I highly recommend Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park to all of you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a true ma ##rve ##l . My parent used to visit here and would r ##ave about it . We booked a reservation and found everything they said was true . Very professional staff . First class rooms . Amazing bar . Stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a quality stay and a convenient location . Nice rooms and accommodation ##s close to the park . Also 200 characters to submit a review is a little bit excessive . Hotel was great , what else do you need to know ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for the weekend and loved the charm of this property . The staff is warm and friendly . The rooms were clean and com ##fy . We had 3 rooms for our family and they were all slightly different in size and layout , but each one was very comfortable . The v ##alet & bell services were pro ##mpt and friendly too . We enjoyed art ##isan cocktail ##s at the bar in the evening at the South Water restaurant in the building . There is free coffee and wine hour for guests , a nice touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Please be aware when booking a double room with this hotel you will only get a 4 ' bed with the option to upgrade for a lot more money , paint p ##eel ##ing off bathroom ceiling and water under the bath ! ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a g ##em of a bout ##ique hotel with f ##abulous rooms a co ##sy bar and the best hospitality and attention to detail I have experience in an US hotel . Would highly recommend this hotel if staying in the Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very central place , almost in front of Trump Tower and near popular music hall House of Blues . Almost everything in a walking distance , but you may also use public transport which is nearby . Personnel is very patient and helpful . Special appreciation to Drake for his hospitality from the very first minute of our stay . Breakfast is not very diverse , but still it ' s quite enough for the morning . Evening app ##eti ##zers and drinks much better ! Good choice of wine ( be aware , alcohol is not compliment ##ary ) . Ask for the room with a street view ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is comfortable to stay as the room is spacious , clean and fairly quiet . There are many facilities . I liked the location so we could reach most of the places easily . There is only one thing that bothered me was the lack of many choices in meals , especially for Muslims . We were almost 20 persons and they knew we were coming but there was not much choice in eating especially at lunch and dinner as the main course was based on only two choices to choose from . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service , location , people , food , and am ##bian ##ce . Total ##ly enjoyed my stay . Will stay here again whenever in Chicago . Great place for a night in the city . Close enough to walk to mi ##chi ##gan avenue and all the shops [SEP]
1	[CLS] D ##wayne the bell ##man was great ! So friendly and helpful , as was the rest of the staff . The hotel was renovated when it became a H ##ya ##tt property , so it doesn ’ t have the old classic elegant feel it used to , but everything is new and very clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel with nice accommodation . Staff very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and pleasant . Nice ##r than normal gym . Great location in the heart of Chicago . Very clean and spacious rooms . Bath ##rooms , slip ##pers and umbrella ##s supplied ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I just spent two wonderful nights at the Ki ##nz ##ie . A small hotel but well located and excellent staff .

1	[CLS] We had 6 grandchildren at the Palmer House for our traditional " Christmas in Chicago " weekend . I had booked 3 rooms on the Executive Level . Tri ##na Davis , at check - in , was extremely helpful , kind , and patient as she worked to locate rooms that would be appropriate for the crew . Thank you for making our stay at the Palmer House memorable , and stress free , Tri ##na ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I have stayed at the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile Intercontinental on multiple trips to Chicago and have had a wonderful experience each time . This year we were travelling with our two month old and it was the first time in a hotel . We were able to check - in early and and the hotel was wonderful in supplying us extra compliment ##ary water bottles and a c ##ri ##b to make us more comfortable . The W ##i ##F ##i worked great and we love having the Star ##bu ##cks on the ground floor to go to for breakfast each day . We will certainly stay here again next time we ’ re in town - the customer service is f ##abulous , the rooms are clean and well looked after and the location can ’ t be beat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] perfect location for the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile crowd that wants to be off the beaten path . Great bar , incredible restaurant . Close to the path along Lake Michigan . Close enough to walk to the river ! Room ##s are lovely but as often with older hotels , the walls can be thin ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Dar ##lene is truly my hero . I left very important documents at the hotel when I checked out and didn ' t realize for almost two months . When I got in touch with Dar ##lene at Security she immediately took ownership of my issue and got it resolved in no time . I am so very grateful . What a wonderful person ! Thank you so much ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Modern but historic feel , this hotel is ideal for anyone and everyone ! I arrived early and they checked me in with no problems which I was grateful for as this meant I could start my exploring of Chicago AS ##AP ! For a solo trip , my room was the right size , my rain shower was heaven and bed was com ##fy ! If I am being ni ##t pick ##y , there were about 2 small stain ##s on the carpet but other than that , I have no ##oo ##o complaints . . . It is close to E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING ( Lou Mal ##nat ##i ' s , Original Pan ##cake house , Red Line , etc ) as it is right around the corner from the great Michigan Ave . The gym is open 24 hours which was awesome . For this to be a solo trip and my first time in Chicago , I would certainly stay here again ! It made me love CH ##IC ##AG ##O ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were on a bus trip and this hotel was booked by the tour company on our behalf ( Great Canadian Holiday ##s ) My wife and I were very impressed with the quality of the hotel , the clean ##liness , friend ##liness and efficiency of the staff and the restaurants and other amenities offered . We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay and would most definitely stay there again if we travel to Chicago on our own [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was the best hotel we could have chosen for our stay during ch ##rist ##mas . It was close to everything and 1 block from lots of great eat ##eries . The beds were so comfortable it was had to get up each morning . Breakfast was good and hot with different things each day . Kitchen was very convenient . Staff was awesome and everyone you encountered always said hello ! I would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good for what we needed which was a night out in the Old town bar area . Easy walk to and from lots of great bars . The building and room were a bit older but still clean enough . Might not do an extended stay but it was a clean room in a great location [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff were pleasant and helpful , linen ##s were clean du ##vet ##s , and the shower was nice . The rest of the experience was decided ##ly average . Based on the pictures and website , I was expecting a carefully restored and well - maintained classic hotel . Instead , there seemed to be a lot of def ##er ##red maintenance ( paint in the lobby , elevators poorly upgraded circa 1970 ) , and the rooms s ##hab ##by . The bathroom and some trim had been updated , but the carpet was worn and stained , the furniture was a mix of old - not antique - pieces and ugly newer items like you ' d see at any mid - priced chain hotel . The building is beautiful , so it ' s too bad that Mill ##eni ##um doesn ' t seem interested in caring for it properly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s were very nice . The pillows were superb . Room was very clean and comfortable . The food for breakfast was very good but price ##y ! The staff was friendly and helpful . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were so glad we picked this hotel - close enough but far enough from the festival . The rooms are simple and clean - the lighting at night really makes the room feel warm and welcoming . We didn ' t get to enjoy the pump room however the lounge and library were great . The slide ##rs were so good ! Everyone working the library bar were great from am to pm . Love ##d the neighborhood and being able to walk around the city for great food and shopping . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is p ##rist ##ine and in a great spot near the river but it will be a ta ##d price ##y . Pro ##s Beautiful Room ##s Great Service Amazing View ##s Close to the River and the Mile Con ##s You ' re going to have to pay for it [SEP]
1	[CLS] Talbot ##t Hotel was wonderful ! Came to Chicago for h ##us ##ban ' s birthday and to see H ##AM ##IL ##TO ##N . Central ##ly located to the shopping on Oak , Ch ##est ##nut and Michigan Ave . Staff was expect ##ional . Room ##s clean and com ##fo ##rable . Would stay again . ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed on a Wednesday night . Save ##d some money deciding on this hotel . Check in was a breeze , room was small , but to be expected in an older building . I was impressed with the modern bathroom . Room 81 ##4 worked for us & we enjoyed the s ##li ##ver of lake we could see . Great location . Will stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room In the grand tower was dirty , the phone did not work , the carpet was ripped , wall paper was p ##eel ##ing off the walls . Management was terrible at hotel . They did not care about the hotel . Staff seemed poorly trained . There was p ##oop in the pool . Save you money . There are many other choices with in a few blocks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont offered us convenient a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s for our Chicago experience . The hotel exceeded our expectations in all areas . We especially enjoyed the views from our windows . The Columbus Ta ##p offered g ##lut ##en - free cooking that met the all ##er ##gy - related needs of my grandchildren . We ate there several times for that reason . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed here on business . The hotel is small - is ##h but comfortable and well appointed . The staff really makes this place . Everyone was friendly , helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . My room was comfortable and made for a very nice stay . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Room ##s are getting worn . No ##is ##y - much more than most hotels . You can unfortunately hear every toilet flush and people ha ##cking up their lungs at 6 : 00 AM from every room around you . You know they ' ve heard this complaint many times because when they have " quiet times " signs posted all around the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel itself is really nice and no complaints about that . The check in process was a joke . Room ##s weren ' t ready after 3 pm which makes no sense . Having to check bags with the bell ##man and then finding something else to do isn ' t what I had in mind . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is convenient but not for public transit . The hotel is huge and fine but if the best part ? If the weather is good , you have to do the river ##walk fire pits . Could just sit there all night ! So good ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My first stay in the new H ##ya ##tt acquisition Talbot ##t . Excellent property , engaging staff , spacious rooms , excellent location for shopping , dining , etc . The bar area is comfortable and perfect for a glass of wine after a long day . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Our family stayed at the Conrad Chicago for a quick fall break get ##away . We had an excellent time and would highly recommend . The location was perfect for walking to restaurants , Millennium Park , and Michigan Avenue shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small hotel experience was exceptional . Plan to stay at The Talbot ##t again . Front desk staff professional and persona ##ble . Our room was very clean and well maintained daily . Restaurant was convenient ; menu options were sufficient ; quality was very good ; staff pleasant and at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The price is not bad and the property is very nice . Staff is excellent and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting as well . It ' s really nice having the E ##N ##O ##logy wine bar and Mi ##che ##al Jordan ' s St ##eak ##house right in the hotel . Otherwise , the location is excellent . I ' ve been coming here for years and it ' s one of my favorite places to stay . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie staff was amazing ! Part ##icular ##ly Ra ##ul and Jim ##el on the night shift of April 30th , they were very professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Amazing hosts . I would definitely stay here again . Close in proximity to the magnificent mile , river north , and really great downtown bars . The hotel was clean and up to date , I loved the big windows . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here due to the close proximity of the Chicago Christmas Market . We were within walking distance to everything , it was very handy . We walked to the Christmas Market , Field Museum , The Bean , Macy ' s just about everywhere we wanted to hit was close . So close to the theatre that while we were there we caught a show . I checked trip ##ad ##visor for the best ch ##ica ##go deep dish pizza close by , low and be ##hold there was a place 6 blocks away , and it did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint us . Staff was un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly helpful from the time we pulled up to the front of the building until we pulled out . I really like to try new places but if I ever come to Chicago again this is where I will be staying . So convenient to everything we wanted ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location downtown , Navy pier , restaurants and excellent friendly & helpful staff . Easy check - in and out . Um ##bre ##llas in room for personal use . Odd odor from Front of room door , unsure if it was water chemical but made staff aware upon check ##out . Would stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Re ##ceived a fantastic diamond member upgrade to a suite for a Sunday to Tuesday stay . Beautiful weather so the roof top bar was a great way to spend a few minutes over a drink . We took advantage of the breakfast v ##ou ##cher and enjoyed it while overlooking Michigan avenue from 20 floors up . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a special stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel room cramped especially bathroom . Light ##ing too crude or too dark , lack of desk lamp . Re ##quest ##ed a coffee machine in my room . Bar food is sub ##stand ##ard , only cold plates . Co ##ck ##tails are not im ##agi ##nat ##ive , heavy and too sweet . 312 restaurant cooking is over ##rated , g ##rea ##sy experience . Nice 1st floor lobby . There are other more interesting hotels around , Kim ##pton All ##egro is average and I would suggest a serious step up of Bar and 312 to make it s highlight . I ##mp ##roving room design is second step . Staff is friendly and professional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first stay and it was te ##rri ##fic all round . From arrival to departure , they made it memorable . Location is awesome and hotel entry is very secure . . . 100 ft from Michigan Ave and 1 block from Water Tower . Great shopping , dining , and touring . We took advantage of a special rate where parking was included and that made it extra wonderful . . . a $ 67 value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was a small , but very comfortable . Show ##er was above average . Nice view of the lake . Great location . Would recommend to friends and family . Park ##ed at the Drake garage , which is cheaper than v ##alet at The K ##nick . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been a frequent guest at the Talbot ##t for decades , through all the changes and upgrades to the facility and de ##cor over 3 decades . What hasn ' t changed is the quality of the people who serve , from charming bell ##men who stop traffic to help you out of your car at the front entrance ( thank you D ##wayne and Perry ) , to the welcoming front desk and con ##cier ##ge service desk ( thank you Gene and Tim ) , even house ##keeping and maintenance staff you might meet in the halls and elevators . Everyone is g ##rac ##ious and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The restaurant is the best it ' s ever been . The price is right and the rooms are clean and well thought out with everything you need . The location just off MI Ave at The Hancock Tower puts you walk ##able to everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As an experienced business travel ##ler , I am fortunate to stay at many different hotels . A gold member at Bon V ##oy and Hilton . Yet , booked O ##m ##ni because my usual hotel was fully booked . Was so surprised at the total experience that I am considering changing hotels for our next convention to the O ##m ##ni Chicago ( we book 50 nights for the convention - 10 rooms ) ! Staff , rooms , restaurant and convenience are at 10 ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are were denied seating at their Breakfast B ##uff ##et . I came down once and the hostess told me all their empty seats by the windows were reserved ? I called the front desk to make a reservation for their " b ##uff ##et " and was told to come down in 30 minutes and again no reserved seats for us . And then the hostess is trying to seat us at a tiny table . I ask again can we be seated at the windows and she says NO , i ask her why ? She stumble ##s and still says NO and then say ok . S ##hov ##es two menu ##s in our faces and leaves . She said those seats are for pp ##l se ##r ##vic ##ing the bar , there were so many empty seats . I don ' t why this happened . It ruined my weekend . I felt awful to be a victim of disc ##rim ##inator ##y behavior . It ' s a very dish ##ear ##ten ##ing feeling . I will not be se ##r ##vic ##ing an O ##m ##ni Hotels at all E ##VE ##R . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , suites are super com ##fy , the bed is extremely comfortable , not much exterior noise at all and the restaurant in the hotel is great ! The restaurant also makes great drinks , it is a comfortable atmosphere to have a drink and wind down after a long day . Love how they accept dogs , that is truly the best ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a wedding and stayed here . It was a great hotel with a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting amenities and services . The only issue is that the fridge is so stock ##ed with things the hotel wants you to buy that there is no room to bring back left ##overs or other things you may have purchased for drinking or eating . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is one of the many excellent places to stain the heart of Chicago . Basic ##ally across the street from " The Bean " great base to explore the city . W ##aling distance to the main attractions . Super comfortable beds and pillows . No complaints at all ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you enjoy no ##stal ##gia from the 80s you will love the television remote ##s at this establishment which are provided with no intended irony since the rooms look like they haven ' t been updated since that time frame . The staff also does not enjoy giving out late check ##outs and is generally un ##hel ##pf ##ul or a ##path ##etic . Honestly , the view is probably the only thing going for it because the rooms are small , and the restaurant only serves a su ##shi special with no app ##eti ##zers ( no other options ) . I would avoid this place and stay at the virgin hotel which is worth the $ 180 for the night ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] great hotel that has an amazing location with f ##abulous staff . and good clean rooms . if you need anything just ask . breakfast on the patio is a must . a short walk to a local market and the transit system . would stay here again when I return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed here in the past for conferences and events . Staff and service is as good as ever . However , the property itself could do with a pick - me - up . The bathroom in my room had water stain ##s on the ceiling ; there was p ##eel ##ing paint in the 7th floor corridor leading to the fitness center , and the lobby bar seems to have temporarily " lost " its bar menu . Nothing that can ' t be fixed , though . All in all , quite satisfactory for my needs . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed here for four nights while visiting Chicago for our granddaughter ' s gym ##nast ##ic competition . I doubt we could ask for a nice ##r place for the price . We were greeted kindly and with the hospitality gathering that included salad , past ##a , free beer and wine . This is offered during the week . It was very good . The breakfast was excellent each morning . The house ##keeping service very at ##ten ##tive and polite . We enjoyed the pool as well . Our room was spacious and overlooked the city , clean and comfortable . We have stayed at other Home ##wood Suite ##s and this is one of the best . I highly recommend it and will stay here again if I return to Chicago . It is a good location to many area restaurants and shopping . Ku ##dos ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pub ##ili ##c seems to check all the boxes , until you are there . The front desk staff is un ##res ##po ##ns ##ive and doesn ' t help when you ask for it . The P ##ump Room and Library staff are slow and rude . Very disappointing [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Ki ##nz ##ie while in Chicago for a business trip and was pleased with everything the Ki ##nz ##ie had to offer . Pre ##fect location to the River Walk , restaurants and just about everything Chicago has to offer . The rooms are clean and spacious . Will be returning to this hotel in the spring with my wife for a weekend get ##away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were not informed that there was a labor dispute and boy were the effects felt . There was no soap in our room when we arrived ; the garbage was not take out for three days ; one day the room was not made up AT AL ##L ! Finally , we specifically asked that the coffee would be re ##ple ##nish ##ed ( and we didn ' t trust it would happen automatically ) . We were assured it would be . It was not . The wheels have come off this place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in was quick & easy . They were able to provide us with a fridge & fan in our room which we greatly appreciated ! It was very clean & the staff were all very friendly & helpful . Also , a great location within walking distance to many restaurants & shopping ! The door ##man , " D ##wayne " made our first trip to Chicago more enjoyable ! He is truly a " people person " & was so helpful & friendly , you can tell that he loves his job ! Overall a great place to stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful and s ##ty ##lish hotel at Chicago ' s Gold Coast . Beautiful and clean rooms . Amazing bar , reception and lounge area . Hip and cool de ##cor . Friendly and correct staff . Lake and shopping are within walking distance . I enjoyed my 5 - days stay completely and hope to come back soon . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment we arrived until we checked out , we were well taken care of . The room was gorgeous and very clean . The whole hotel was one I would say that made you feel at home and well cared for . It was a treat and I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room hasn ' t been properly cleaned upon check in , second day no one came to cleaned the room ( how can you miss it ? ) so we had to call guest service for clean towels to get ready for the evening and make our own bed . . ( We ' ve even left a * please change bed card * on the bed . . ) , We couldn ' t get W ##i ##F ##i connection as connection is so poor ! Matt ##ress is dated , very uncomfortable and do ##d ##gy hair dry ##er keep stopping , perhaps need regular check of guest rooms ? Please think if you are the hotel guest , you won ##t be happy . . . . Hu ##gel ##y regret that we ' ve stayed there . . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect ##ly located , 2 minutes a ##foot from Michigan Avenue , 2 minutes from the L Train and 10 minutes from Mill ##eni ##um Park , this finely decorated hotel offers very pretty , and co ##zy rooms , where everything is very well thought . The beds are perfect , and i particularly liked the little wooden tray to go and catch your compliment ##ary breakfast . Everything is well thought to please the guests and make their stay as convenient as it can be . All in all i loved my stay and i ' ll certainly go back to the Ki ##nz ##ie if i ever go back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not happy re my stay ! ! I couldn ' t flush my toilet due to it being broken . Re ##quest ##ed two beds and was given a queen size bed but a friend , who checked in 2 hours later received two beds . Pa ##id for breakfast and never told that I would be given gift cards to purchase breakfast at Star ##bu ##cks , which sold out of everything ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We scored a great deal on a suite . After checking we noticed we were close to a noisy ice machine and an elevator . We requested a relocation and were very pleased to be relocated to a quiet location on the 25th floor with a view of the city and a glimpse of the lake . The room was very clean and the bed and bed ##ding very comfortable . Our living room had a comfortable couch and a small kitchen with a sink and refrigerator . Our suite was spacious . The lobby was on the 3rd floor which made for an elevator change but was good for security . The exercise room on the 5th floor looked to be well equipped and had locker rooms and a pool adjoining . The hotel is right on Michigan Avenue and convenient to many fine restaurants and shopping . We enjoyed our stay and will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The first time i stayed here it was in the rock and roll suite . fun and kits ##chy with a j ##uke box and a t ##v being thrown out the window . . On my subsequent visits I stayed in there regular suites and have never been disappointed . rooms are well appointed spacious and clean . large windows and banquet ##te seating offering decent views . one of my favorite hotels . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you plan to stay here make sure you book a Regency Club room . Great service and enjoyable atmosphere . And Regency Club team member , Tony ##a , is the best hostess ever ! She was there to answer every question and provide the best customer service possible . We left feeling like she was our new best friend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel as part of a trade show and I was very happy I did . The triangular design of the hotel allows for great views of downtown and the lake from most rooms . The bed and bath were very nice and it had a large desk and work chair plus a lo ##ung ##ing chair and o ##tto ##man . It was one of the nice ##st rooms and hotel I have been to and a long time . I would definitely stay here again . And it is close to a lot of nice restaurants and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel is very close to Downtown . The Room has a great Space and the Bath disposed a bath ##tub ##e . The Bus Station was 3 min away and the Subway 5 min . We was surrounded by very kind and helpful ##l Hotel staff . I can really recommend the Hotel with Central Location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A nice hotel . Well located for many of the city ’ s attractions . Generally service is good , though I think the reception staff could be a little more pro ##active at check in time . Room service does need a review mind you . Even after two calls , our request seemed beyond them . Which is a pity as generally our experience of So ##fit ##el has been better than this . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##cel ##ent hotel for the price and central ##ly located in Chicago . very close to public transportation if you did not want to rent a car . Hotel staff was very f ##re ##ind ##ly and a ##cco ##mo ##dating and rooms were very clean and comfortable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a wonderful place and stay . Right in the heart of downtown Chicago the place leaves nothing to be desired . Easy to walk everywhere , historic photos all over the place , it ' s a ve ##ritable art gallery ! Oh and bonus , the gym is wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location in the middle of Chicago . Si ##ght ##see ##ing locations within walking distance . Nice , com ##fy room . Breakfast ##bu ##ffe ##t with plenty of variety on each floor . Friendly staff . T ##ip : Hotel offers v ##alet parking but there are plenty of self parking garage ##s on nearby blocks where you can park your car cheaper if you look on the internet and reserve a parking spot . I used " Park ##ing Pan ##da " and made a reservation at Sterling G ##ara ##ge just a block away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are so unique , window seats , large bathroom . We came to ch ##ica ##go for a little get ##away for a friends b ##day and there was plenty of room for all 4 of us . The staff are incredible , Jonathan , Ron and Gabe helped make our friends birthday so special . They are amazing . Thank you guys so much . Also the bartender in the am was very helpful with giving things to do , and her drink making skills . . . . mm ##m [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you ' r going to spend a Christmas weekend , for me , this is the place to go . If your a walk ##er , most places can be gotten to by walking , the Art Museum is a nice mile walk , if not , there are cab ' s everywhere . I find the staff here to be outstanding . I ' ve been coming here for ten years now , at Christmas , and I ' m known the minute I step from the cab . I get value for my dollar here , and as long as I have a dollar to spend , I ' ll spend it here at Christmas , [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff work like robots without even a little consideration of the client . Hospital ##ity is one word their dictionary doesn ' t have . The lady at the bell desk is completely the worst human being i have ever met . " You ' re young you can carry your own bags if your in a hurry " like W ##o ##W ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff was very a ##cco ##mad ##ing . Check in was a breeze . The room had an amazing view with all the amenities you would expect from a high class hotel . The bar was very nice and there is an nice lounge area outside . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Most H ##ya ##tts are excellent in every ##way . This one is bad need of up ##dating of guest rooms . I have had better experience in a Best Western . Mi ##lde ##w smell ##y room , extremely small bathroom with no counter space , broken mirror , broken coffee pot . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My recent stay at The Talbot ##t will ruin all other hotels for me . I took a trip to Disney recently and the service at The Talbot ##t was even more wonderful . Every single staff member is friendly , genuine , and sincere in their inter ##aca ##tions with hotel guests . The hotel itself was absolutely stunning , the location was a dream , and the overall experience was un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble . On every vacation I take in the future I will certainly be hoping that there ' s a Jo ##ie de V ##iv ##re hotel nearby . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was not only a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting but the view from the hotel window looking at downtown Chicago was phenomena ##l ! The v ##alet was pro ##mpt and the staff was very professional and friendly . The only complaint I have is that room service was little price ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is clean and under ##state ##d . The location can ' t be beat - - right next to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . I especially appreciated the housekeeper , Marc ##ie . It was a comfortable place to visit with family , including a two year old . Also , dogs were allowed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay and would recommend this hotel . Rafael and Omar who are the bartender ##s at the lobby bar are great ambassador ##s for this Kim ##pton Hotel . They are service oriented and customer focused . They also make great cocktail ##s . [SEP]

1	[CLS] I ' ve been staying at She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago for almost 8 years during a yearly held meeting in my profession . Always a pleasure to stay there . Great facilities . Great and friendly staff . Connie and Rene in the Club lounge are te ##rri ##fic ! Nice renovation two years ago of the rooms . I love the pool and health club facilities . Great beds ! ! Only thing missing is a laptop safe ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My 12 year old daughter and I stayed here a while ago . The check in was efficient - people helped with the luggage and the car immediately . The location was great , within walking distance of many places to see in a 30 hour stay . It was quiet , despite its being downtown . Our only issue really was the the room was tiny . Otherwise , we were happy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful stay in ch ##ica ##go . Big room with an incredible city view . Help ##ful ##l staff mainly the con ##cier ##ge m ##r j ##as ##on . best location in town , almost in the corner of mi ##chi ##gan a ##ve . with a bunch of shops and restaurants nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel is superb ! close to subway , shopping , and great rest ##ura ##unts . We will be back to ch ##ica ##go and we will be staying here again The hotel staff were able to meet all my a ##cco ##mo ##dation needs after there was a big mistake with Hilton reservations . I was very pleased [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was clean and welcoming . Our room service was great . The beds are so comfortable and the large bathroom is well appointed . We always feel comfortable and valued at So ##fit ##el Chicago . C ##0 ##mp ##lint ##ary water and bed Turn down are a luxurious plus . I love the attention we receive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Upon traveling for business to Chicago from Ohio I met two lovely Hilton employees . Doyle and Sandra we ' re so pleasant and welcoming . I ' ve been a diamond member for over eight years and this is a large reason why I only travel Hilton ! ! I was offered a package through Grand V ##aca ##tions buy both of them and I ' m so excited for my next travel experience with Hilton ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Hotel is located right in the heart of Chicago ' s action . The hotel is very clean and the staff is very helpful . We were greeted by front desk agent Ka ##ssa ##ndra and she was very helpful in securing us a room in a time ##ly manner while fulfilling our high floor request . Our rooms always had turn ##down service when we returned . The elevators always were accessible without wait . The hotel is also located right by 3 of Chicago ' s deep - dish pizza institutions along with the CT ##A Red Line , which takes you to many of the Chicago attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a couple of nights at the end of April as we began our Route 66 journey . Chicago is a fantastic city and this hotel is in a great location just at the start of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Service excellent , especially the guys on the door who were always ready to exchange smiles and laughs . The general areas were good but the rooms felt in need of a bit of an update , bit dark and de ##pressing , holes in the curtain made it feel a bit un ##love ##d . Can ' t comment on food as we didn ' t eat here , drinks good and in same price range as you would expect . Overall OK but when we return to Chicago will probably stay elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an amazing weekend and New Years at Chicago Hilton . A special “ Thank You ” to Steven at the diamond front desk for going above and beyond to make our weekend extra special . Arturo also made breakfast special on our anniversary . We enjoyed every aspect of our stay , and happily recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I had a f ##abulous weekend there . The staff was super helpful and court ##eous . There were plenty of dining options . close to the things we wanted to do . And the front door service al ##way had is in a cab within minutes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is convenient ##ly located and within walking distance of many of the great sights and things to do in Chicago . The Gold Floor service is ex ##em ##p ##lary . Some of the rooms have really good views - we could see the fireworks from Navy Pier out our window . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an older hotel but rooms have been re ##mo ##del ##ed . The staff is persona ##ble and helpful . The food at the restaurant is very well prepared and the service is excellent . This hotel is a block off of Michigan Avenue and in a great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is absolutely beautiful . Non residents use the lobby bar because it is spectacular , Hilton honours members get free breakfast and evening ni ##bble ##s . Hu ##ge rooms . Very friendly con ##cier ##ges . Excellent location . Re ##com ##men ##ded [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in town for a pu ##g event , great hotel for pets ! I joined Ka ##rma rewards so the W ##i ##F ##i was free but a weak signal . Very friendly staff , the wine hour from 5 - 6 was nice . In the Loop , next to the El , fast and easy to get where you ' re going . Our room was facing north , nice view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you ’ re looking for a great spot to stay in Chicago , the Conrad won ’ t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Great design , great location , great staff . . . this property has it all . The rooftop bar offered a fun escape for pre - dinner drinks . I hope I have the chance to return and enjoy all the amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is really convenient for exploring Chicago . We walked to most places that tourists would visit - the mall ##s , the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , the lake etc . There are lots of really good restaurants , coffee shops and fast food places nearby . There are also lots of shops and supermarket ##s The hotel is on the 5th floor and above and there are 2 elevators to ii ##t which got regularly busy . This was the down ##side The rooms however are good sized , comfortable beds , nice bathroom ##s , and w ##i - fi , TV etc . The pool was being repaired and we did not get to use it though we could have accessed the pool at the Hilton Garden Inn a block away The breakfast ##s are b ##uff ##et style and is very reasonable . The staff are really friendly and very helpful All in all a very nice stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , large room , quiet nights , great shower , everything you need in a hotel . Great for business travel , but I will certainly be bringing my family here on my next trip to Chicago . Best thing about this hotel is the staff , nothing was too much trouble , everything is done with a smile . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in a standard room on the 8th floor , I could hear the guests next door the whole time , which means they heard me too . Every time they walked in their room the corresponding door will rat ##tle and wake me up . The bed was com ##fy but the sleep wasn ' t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town for a quick two - night stay with my 13 year old , who could not tear herself away from the river view window seat - she actually slept there both nights . Service is what we ' ve come to expect from Kim ##pton - friendly , at ##ten ##tive staff ; s ##yl ##ish de ##cor , solid restaurant . Hotel is close to everything - Ma ##g Mile shopping , river tour boats , Millennium Park , subway and el stations . Park ##ing tip : Save by using one of a parking apps ( we used i ##park ##it . com ) to reserve and pre ##pa ##y a spot in a nearby public garage with in / out privileges . We parked at the W ##aba ##sh - Randolph self park for $ 36 total from 4 : 30 ##pm Thursday until 11 ##am Saturday . If we had used the hotel v ##alet , that amount of time would have cost us $ 116 ( 2 nights at $ 58 each ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome stay while attending a conference in Chicago . Special thanks to two ou ##standing She ##rato ##n employees , W ##ahi ##ed He ##lm ##y at the front desk and Connie Alex , Club Lounge ! One of my best hotel experiences ever ! Thank You ! R ##M [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was checked in at 9 am this morning after a snow ##y drive up from Purdue by Maria . Maria recognized I was a bit tired and worked very hard to find a room that was available that early in the morning . All she could find was con ##cier ##ge level so given I am a gold member she upgraded me . Thank You Maria ! ! The hotel is as it always is . . . wonderful ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was immediately welcoming , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and went out of their way to ensure I had what I needed . They oriented me to the surrounding area , offered to hold my bags while I ran out to a convenience store , and made sure that I knew that compliment ##ary re ##f ##resh ##ments were available . The room I stayed in was beautiful - cheerful , sophisticated colors , clean and comfortable bed , and a large , clean bathroom . There was an iron available for me to iron my clothes for a business meeting and the room was very quiet . I would definitely stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All employees at hotel were friendly and pleasant . They seemed to like their jobs . Hotel was very clean and modern . Hotel was quiet even though there seemed to be a large number of guests . Breakfast had very few g ##lut ##en free ( G ##F ) options . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed that there was not even a G ##F cold cereal choice . Room was well equipped . Bed was much too soft . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3 ##night ##s and we never wanted to leave . Amazing views from super spacious and clean suite . Hotel staff went over the top to make our kids feel welcome and have fun . Q ##uo ##te from daughter : “ They keep sneaking in our room and doing nice things ! ” We definitely will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , at ##ten ##tive staff , spacious rooms ! Really enjoyed our stay , wished we had had a pool . Easy to walk everywhere . Pre ##ferred eating out , rather then at the hotel . Work out facility was excellent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is an easy walk to about anywhere . The service was excellent . Bar very nice with indoor and out seating . Our room was first class . The bed and pillows were the most comfortable I have ever had . I tried to get a label so we could buy them . None unfortunately . We paid extra for a higher room with a view . I wouldn ' t do that again . The view is mainly of other buildings . If you look around the edges , you can see the lake . On the lower floors , all you will see is other buildings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Train the bartender ##s better . C ##lar ##ify the free drink cards . Co ##mp ##lim ##ents to the staff for friend ##liness and service - they were wonderful ! The hotel was clean and fresh looking and feeling . One couple out of 9 was disappointed in the size of their room . . . am not sure what happened there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni downtown is in a great location . You can walk to shops , restaurants , and entertainment . The hotel is clean and very comfortable . There is a restaurant - bar and a work ##out room . The v ##alet service is friendly and helpful . Be aware that on a weekend night you might want to call for your car about 20 to 30 minutes before you need to leave . My only complaints were that there is no hot tub , but a lot of hotels don ' t have them . Also the front desk is on the 3 Rd floor and there is a separate elevator bank to go up from the third floor to higher floors . So every time you come and go you have to take two separate elevator rides . Not the end of the world unless you ' re in a hurry . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great clean large rooms . Nice atmosphere and lounge . Great location and very friendly staff . Love the sliding bathroom doors ! Star ##bu ##cks on site ! ! ! Just a short walk to the lake and Sandy Beach . Multiple conference rooms with adequate space . Perfect for business or pleasure . Plus being in a new city of you need help you have the option to text the front desk and they will help you find your way anytime ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had excellent attention from Cha ##ris ##se who assigned us a a beautiful newly re ##mo ##dell ##ed room and gave us a great welcome with her hospitality after a late flight . Then Marcus also at the front desk was very helpful with tourist ##ic tips and hints of bus lines to museums . We will surely be back to this hot ##es ##l as soon as possible . It also has the best location for shopping and restaurants just 2 or three minutes from mi ##chi ##gan avenue at the corner of the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I came home to visit my mothers grave . I thoroughly enjoyed our hotel stay . We had a very nice time . The entire staff was so welcoming and cater ##ed to our every need . Gay ##le gave excellent information on seeing the sites . We will definitely be back to the Fair ##mont in the near future ! E ##ff ##ie [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay here a couple times a year with our son . It ' s a two minute walk from Michigan Avenue , 8 blocks from the Navy Pier ( 15 minute walk ) and a ton of great places to eat nearby . Room ##s are recently renovated , and are nice . Only complaint is the elevators are very slow when it busy so request a lower room . I have stayed in many different places in Chicago over the years , but no place is more central ##ly located if you are looking to do the family tourist thing . I probably would not stay here for a business trip but for a family trip its great if that makes sense . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad was already a good hotel from my first visit a year ago , but I think they ' ve gotten better . The property itself is very nice and surprisingly good for a domestic luxury hotel . Service was decent before , but I noticed that the staff are even more friendly , pro ##mpt , and anti ##ci ##pate your needs better . Everyone , from the v ##alet to the staff man ##ning the door and lobby , to front desk and room service were true professionals . And everyone was refusing tips ! We booked a wonderful Chicago suite ( no bath ##tub ) , but b ##um ##med out we didn ' t get upgraded as Diamond members to the Sky ##line Suite which has a tub . Communication with the staff was easy with the Conrad app . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very convenient ##ly located near Michigan Ave this property is very clean and comes with all the amenities . Staff are very friendly and always rooms are clean . Both the restaurants are bars on the property are well stacked . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Intercontinental is a great combination of history , price , and location . Walking distance from many attractions along and near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! Parts of the property could use some up ##dating , but there are also many historical artifacts that are loving ##ly preserved . Very decent price for this near - perfect location . Our room on the 26th floor of the older , Executive Tower suffered from an awkward layout and almost zero view ( unless you are a H ##VA ##C tech who loves looking at ins ##ulated CH ##W pipes , duct ##work , and ##air handle ##rs . Michael Jordan ' s restaurant and bar are super convenient for rainy days and pretty reasonably priced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a grand hotel in one of the best locations in the city ! It sits right on the Chicago River ##walk , which is a must see & do . It is minutes away from Michigan Avenue shopping and the rooms are nice . Check - in was slow and our first room smelled like cigarette smoke , however we were moved immediately . The views from either side of the building are breath ##taking . I would recommend a stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay was excellent in every way ! Friendly staff , excellent property . The historic pool area was incredible and brought a " turn of the century " feel to the area . I honestly can ' t think of one thing I would change , except a few days more to visit the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my second time staying at the Palmer House . The hotel is great , staff is friendly and the lobby is beautiful . Room ##s are nice and clean , somewhat on the smaller side , but perfect for coming and going . Bath ##rooms are also very small which can be a challenge when multiple people are trying to get ready , but do not let that stop you from booking here . We will be staying here again for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] v ##alet ##s didn ##t charge our car . They were clue ##less . No coffee pots in room . Let guests know they can get a k ##eur ##ig if they ask . ( found this out at check in ) . Need real cups to drink coffee . Our te ##sla never got charged in 2 days . We asked ahead at ##ime & d ##ts ##yed here be ##cs ##use we were told they had charge ##rs . But v ##alet didn ##t know what to do . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I absolutely fell in love with this hotel , it has such a sophisticated old world v ##ibe , such a beautiful property . We were celebrating a birthday and the staff was so helpful with getting us a suite , champagne , balloons and snack ##s in the room that really made us feel special . The location is perfect , close to everything and will be my go to from now on when I travel to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a wonderful location , central to much of the north river and Michigan Avenue areas . The service and staff were excellent and exceeding ##ly helpful . The room was nice enough - no problems there . The exercise facility is me ##h with only a few machines , so maybe plan to get your work ##out in during non - peak times . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just started a six day business / personal travel trip and broke my foot the first night . All the hotel staff was at ##ten ##tive and genuinely concerned about my well being . The door ##men ( especially Rufus ) went out of there way to help me and my knee s ##co ##oter get in and out of cab ##s and in and out of the hotel . The security staff was able to help me the first couple of days with wheelchair service so I didn ' t have to navigate that big hotel on my c ##ru ##tches . If you like the historical US hotels around the country be sure to try Hilton Chicago and make sure to take a peek inside the beautiful Grand Ball ##room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We absolutely loved our stay . The staff were excellent ( especially John from the front desk ) . It was our anniversary and the hotel was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The food at Ba ##pt ##ise and Bo ##ttle was amazing too . This is definitely our new go - to hotel in Chicago . The hotel is well taken care of and it is clear the staff do what they can to make it not just a luxurious experience but also a memorable one . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve stayed in many luxury hotels , but the service at The Talbot ##t and the friend ##liness of the staff was un ##par ##alle ##led . I felt completely at ease and relaxed . The room was lovely and I particularly enjoyed the Jonathan Adler toilet ##ries . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the hotel for New Years Eve night . The hotel was beautiful and the accommodation ##s were great but what really impressed me was the friend ##liness and professional ##ism of every staff member that we encountered . I especially want to com ##men ##d Dorian Al ##var ##ado . He went above and beyond to help us and he made us feel as though he really cared about us and our stay . I am truly thankful for him . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great hotel , even better location . close proximity to everything ! great views of the river too . They have a nice happy hour offering some free alcoholic beverages for guests , and free coffee in the morning . Room ##s are nice and ch ##ic [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ' t say enough good things about this hotel . The room was great , it had a fridge , hair ##dr ##yer , makeup mirror , and robes ! The breakfast was really nice and so was the staff . It was close to lots of shopping . The price is amazing for what you get . I would love to stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hi , I just wanted to order room service . However , on two different occasions the Chicago Hilton let me down . Basic ##ally , the tablet in my room didn ’ t work , so I tried calling in my order for room service , but they insisted I use the tablet . As a result , I was left hungry and out of luck . Hotel is nice , but the people suck . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very pleasant experience . I am pick ##y when staying at a hotel , this one was very clean and the staff was very very friendly . The rooms were clean , which is where I am the pick ##iest as there is no place like being home in own bed . I would re ##com ##ment this Hotel to any and all . De ##fin ##ite ##ly pay for the breakfast and v ##alet service . We didn ' t worry about our vehicle and if we did need it they had it to the front and would park again no questions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After the previous reviews i was a bit nervous but it was great , the room was well decorated and quiet . My room was spacious and very well equipped . Great TV , lamps with us ##b charging , coffee maker ( requested ) , fast w ##if ##i . Initially i had a problem with my room and it was resolved immediately without any question . The staff were exceptional and couldn ' t have been more helpful . The location is great , walk ##able to everywhere . i booked this hotel as it had a gym but never used it . I would definitely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Fair ##mont in the Gold Suite and the staff was so g ##rac ##ious . They were flexible with room changes , provided a special gift since we were celebrating , and the lounge is top notch . We would definitely recommend and stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is a great location just off Michigan A ##v , staff are friendly and rooms are clean and good size . They have hot drink making facilities , iron and board . TV ’ s that connect to Netflix and YouTube . Excellent if you want to avoid the cold weather . Thanks for the stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a good four star hotel . Great location and nice rooms . Clearly better than a 3 star hotel but also clearly not at the level of a four star hotel . Room ##s were nice but not too fancy and there was some noise from other rooms . Overall though , I would be happy to stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has great customer service . The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly . Very accessible in key areas in Chicago . No issues during my stay . The check in and check out was very smooth . Will definitely go back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bell ##man and house ##keeping staff were fantastic . The front desk was rude at every interaction . I had a missed call from the front desk so I called back and the person goes well I don ’ t know who called you how would I know that . And we had booked a double suite for three nights I checked in and was put in a king for the first night and had to be moved the next day and the front desk acted like I was being difficult and in the wrong when I simply wanted what I paid for . This was a common theme as the person before me was put in a double room and had booked a king room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is a great spot to stay on a well located spot close to Michigan Avenue . The hotel is new and the rooms are com ##fy . This is a perfect spot if you come to ch ##ica ##go for a weekend and want to be close to the action [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were recently in Chicago to see Hamilton and see the downtown sights . The hotel staff was fantastic especially the door ##man Ravi . He was the best ! He was so friendly and helpful with directions , getting us taxi ##s and helping with all our luggage . There were 6 of us so we were grateful for his assistance . All of the staff we encountered smiled and greeted us . Our rooms were clean and had every am ##eni ##ty we needed . We really enjoyed the variety and ease of access ##ing the continental breakfast on our floor and we enjoyed the night ##ly happy hour with great snack ##s . We will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Be ready to pay $ 75 per night for parking or hunt to a parking garage close by . They told me the high cost was due to city taxes . If that ’ s the case , why did it only cost $ 36 per night , a block away ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only stayed 1 night with a family of 4 . Corner king suite with a pull ##out couch , and roll ##away bed . The pull ##out couch was a extremely comfortable and the roll ##away had a pillow top on it . Shock ##ed with how well my kids slept ! Great costume ##r service and an amazing b ##uff ##et on Sunday morning ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , guest rooms are clean and bright . Bath ##rooms are a bit dated , but fine . The bar is a bit odd , doesn ' t have very much personality / v ##ibe and a bit of a miss . The restaurant is very good , and the staff are fantastic ! Elizabeth in Columbus Ta ##p restaurant was extremely persona ##ble , and provided excellent service . I was also thoroughly impressed by the Con ##cier ##ge services Gail provided . What a g ##em ! She made absolutely everything happen for me . . . . and was extremely professional , genuine and pleasant to work with . Thanks for a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location to walk everywhere . The hotel has a 20 ##s theme set up with a free prose ##cco happy hour . Room ##s are exactly what you need . Hotel staff exceptionally fantastic . Sen ##t a bottle of wine and snack ##s for confusion on our room house ##keeping . They didn ' t have to do that , but was especially nice [SEP]
1	[CLS] Considering our current exchange rate this hotel is expensive ( for us ) . I could stay much more up ##market at home for the price . Con ##s : small bathroom with shower over bath and material curtain . Air - condition ##er is NO ##IS ##Y + + + + + . Pro ##s : well located . Large living area . Walk in wardrobe with space for suitcase ##s . Co ##m ##fy bed . G ##ym . Breakfast included , but don ' t expect too much . Basic and certainly doesn ' t aim for excellence . OK if you eat bag ##els , toast or cereal . Not OK if you want something else . Egg ##s are served but are not great . Fresh fruit salad is best , but need to be there as it ' s served . Fresh fruit available too . However I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great view from the 14th floor . The staff was very pleasant even with a g ##rump ##y early morning guest who hadn ' t had their first cup of coffee . they were always ready to find a table for one in the AM . Great staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel in a lovely , historic neighbourhood but the catering is simply not u ##o to scratch . A water k ##ett ##le and tea and coffee are not eve ##m provided in room and when you order a large $ 12 pot of tea you receive 1 tea ##bag a 1 ##lit ##re of water in a coffee pot which tastes like . . . . coffee . Room service arrived in a partial state of completion and I have never seen a breakfast b ##uff ##et in a high end hotel which is so limited . It ' s a shame because this lack of attention to detail really s ##po ##ils the experience . Not really good enough considering the high prices and needs to be improved ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed one night in September prior to attending a Bears game at Soldier Field . The proximity to so many things is what makes this hotel great . Within walking distance of the stadium , museums , restaurants , etc . The room we stayed in was large & updated . We had a park view room overlooking Grant Park . There was a lot of noise from the street , but it ' s an older hotel in downtown Chicago and was to be expected . All the staff we encountered was friendly . Hotel is extremely large so if you have mobility issues , it would be something to think about . I would definitely stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I upgraded to Gold , which meant we got a room when we checked in at 8 ##am - - which I thought alone was worth it - but then got access to the lounge , and the awesome at ##ten ##tive service of Sharon and Abraham ( love you guys ! ) y ##um ##my breakfast ##s , snack ##s and dessert ##s pretty much happening all day there . the views of mill ##eni ##um park are divine , and could even see the j ##um ##bot ##ron from soldier field on game ##day . Absolutely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Di ##s ##regard ##ing the fact that the lifts were not fully operational during my stay , I can for sure guarantee that you will have an am ##az ##ong stay in this property , the location is un ##beat ##able and the service as well [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got a very good deal during the 7 Feb weekend . This is very nice hotel ( 3 / 4 star ) . It is not a hotel room but a 1 ##B ##H ##K apartment with full kitchen inside . View from the room was perfect ( t ##rump tower and downtown ) . Service was good . Room and linen were clean . We enjoyed our stay . Breakfast had so many options from has ##h ##bro ##wn to eggs to wa ##ln ##ut etc . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can ' t say enough great things about this hotel ! Our time there was fantastic and can ' t wait to go back ! The room is excellent , happy hour is even better - but it ' s the staff that really make this place . Everyone works so hard to ensure that everything about your stay is perfect . High ##ly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service . Great room . Ph ##eno ##men ##al location . We over - pay ##ed because we stayed here for Valentine ##s Day , and that same weekend Chicago was hosting the NBA All - Star game . So rates were through the roof . But , that being said , the stay was well worth it and I will definitely be coming back and would prefer to only ever stay here for my return trips to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my third time staying at this H ##ya ##tt and I was again very impressed with the service and quality of the hotel and all of its amenities . The friend ##liest and most helpful staff I have ever seen , and they go out of their way to make sure everything is just perfect . This was my first time eating at the restaurants in the hotel and I must say I was very surprised to find that the food in all of the restaurants was AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! ! I never would have expected such high quality products , genuine home cooking taste , and great portions for very reasonable prices . I especially enjoyed the Wall ##eye Ta ##cos and the chicken wings . Both utterly delicious . The ta ##co bar in the " Living Room Lounge " of the West tower is also a must ! ! You will not be disappointed eating in at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one night and took advantage of an upgrade that included parking and moved us to a corner suite with a separate bedroom , 1 - 1 / 2 baths and 5 windows . This hotel is Art Dec ##o themed and very taste ##ful . We love that Kim ##pton ##s are pet - friendly . The only * minor * thing we noticed was the room had a * slightly * must ##y smell , but very slight and not a big deal . We attribute it to the fact that Kim ##pton renovated a very old building into a hotel . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with a couple of girlfriend ##s while spending the weekend in the city . We were upgraded to a room with two bathroom ##s , which was super nice with the three of us staying in the room . Park ##ing was expensive ( as is usual in Chicago ) , service was great , room was clean and updated , although a little dark . It wouldn ' t be my first choice of hotels in Chicago , but I would stay here again if my favorites weren ' t available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I made reservations online for 4 / 1 / 18 , and after realizing I picked the wrong package I called customer service . A different package was offered to me by Teresa , which I was pleased with because it included breakfast , W ##i ##F ##i , and parking . I even took the time to speak with her manager praising her for excellent service . When we arrive the following day , the Hotel stated there was no record of that package ever being offered . They said there was no record of a call being made either . I guess I must of spoken to myself for 17 minutes , after dial ##ing ( 312 ) 46 ##4 - 1000 on Saturday 3 / 31 / 18 at 5 : 34 ##pm . They pretended like it never happened . The gentlemen at reception said he ’ s never heard of a spring break get ##away package . By the way , that package is on your website . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you want to experience a ch ##ic & class ##y hotel ; do reserve this hotel property on your next adventure into Chicago . . . . . . The am ##bian ##ce and v ##ibe of this particular hotel will leave you with a SM ##IL ##E on your face . . . . . you can ' t believe the U ##LT ##IM ##AT ##E support & service you will receive from the entire hotel staff and management . . . . . The hotel is within walking distance ( two blocks ) to the infamous MA ##G ##NI ##FI ##CE ##NT MI ##LE . . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was awesome experience it always is great location great rooms I mean just all around a great place to be when you go to Chicago is home town so only hotel for the last 5 years I ' ve stayed at I enjoy it always will [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything at this hotel was beyond expectations ! I highly recommend this hotel and will stay here every time I am in Chicago . Location , staff and comfort is second to none . Couldn ' t name a bad thing if I was forced to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Were happy to find out we were right on the magnificent mile with convenient access to so many good eat ##eries , shops , entertainment places , etc . Very co ##sy room with coffee / tea and good t ##v and Internet services . Staff : A star ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our second stay as this wonderful bout ##ique hotel convenient ##ly located to much of everything in downtown Chicago . The people serving one as a guest are the best ! ! Looking forward to our next visit that we are confident will produce a t ##ri ##fect ##a ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] They went out of their way to make sure we got what we needed . Free text messages every day asking if we needed coffee re ##fill ##s or a microwave which they provided free . Room ##s are a little small but that is okay for downtown Chicago and we got a great deal through Price ##line . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very friendly and helpful staff . The hotel is very clean . And breakfast is great . My husband & I are planning to return to Chicago soon for a pleasure trip and will definitely return to this hotel ! ! ! The hotel ’ s location is great also . All kinds of public transportation in the area . And so ##oo ##o much to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is comfortable and elegant , B ##UT we had to wait till 4 ##pm to get into our room which was “ guaranteed ” to be ready at 3 . This was not good because my daughter and I then had to rush to get ready for a wedding . The next day we had to wait over a half hour for the v ##alet service to bring up our car . BA ##D service for an expensive hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have had very Good Service throughout our stay and we have enjoyed the friendly staff and all the a ##cco ##mo ##dation inside the Hotel . The historic Building is an experience which we will Not forget for a Long Time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our company held a board meeting at this location . Everything from arrival to departure was excellent . The staff was always helpful , rooms were very clean , food was very good , and beds were very comfortable . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt Regency was a great choice for my son ’ s graduation party [UNK] We reserved the sky ##line suite & it accommodate ##d all 15 of us to watch the virtual G ##rad ##uation Ce ##rem ##ony & have lunch . Staff was amazing & being able to check in early was useful due to us de ##cor ##ating for the occasion . The view was spectacular ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] You can ’ t go wrong with Hilton . Typical Hilton hotel , nice and com ##fy room with amazing bed . Location is good , could be better . Staff was very helpful . Hotel is a bit big for individual attention but it works . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had two rooms ( one King and one double ) for four nights in July . Both rooms were super clean , modern and comfortable . Love ##d the location and the helpful and friendly staff . We enjoyed our daily greeting ##s from Gregory : ) With free breakfast on every floor , cold + flavor ##ed water in the reception , fast W ##if ##i , and the evening cocktail hour , Ki ##nz ##ie totally knows that they are doing . All of these extra ##s made our stay very enjoyable . Would definitely book here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel right off Ma ##g Mile . Fantastic service . Great experience . Re ##quest ##ed rooms near each other and staff was great in a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . When leaving , the staff brought luggage and put in car while we shop ##ped on the Ma ##g Mile for a bit . Great service . Bed ##s were great , too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Downs ##ide : Make sure you bring your own coffee and tea facility as there is none in the room Up ##side : Friendly staff , value for money , good location , food in restaurants are good quality and delicious ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I Stay ##ed three nights in au ##gus ##t and everything was perfect from check in ( great a ##k ##no ##wl ##ed ##ge of AC ##L ##U ##B gold ) to check out . The position is wonderful at the centre of everything and very ch ##ic . My junior suite had a wonderful view . But the hotel is very well managed . I could continue Hours explaining how everything worked well . Try yours ##elves ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] You would not know this is a very large hotel . The service was always friendly and efficient , and the communal areas were comfortable , spacious , and never felt crowded . It ’ s very central , and only a short walk from the blue line that runs directly to the airport . The room was very clean and comfortable with efficient air con . Spa ##cious , very clean bathroom , and great beds . Not cheap but competitive to other hotels in the area . We would happily return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this because the good reviews , however , I called ahead for early check - in , and while they couldn ' t promise to have it ready early , it was requested . Dec ##ided not to arrive early and arrived at check - in ( 3 : 00 ) and the room wasn ' t ready . Wait ##ed an hour and a half ( 4 : 30 ) , the room still wasn ' t ready . It ' s almost 6 : 00 now and we ' re still not in . Pretty disappointed as were just staying one night and our time has been shortened because of management ##s inability to meet the hotel staff / cleaning requirement and check - in guarantees . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From arrival to departure , the staff very friendly and at ##ten ##tive . The gentleman who checked us in gave us an upgrade ( higher floor , not a bigger room as all the king rooms are the same size ) and because we had to wait 10 minutes to see if our room was ready , he gave us two free drink v ##ou ##chers for Le Bar . Nice touch ! Our room was clean and comfortable and surprisingly quiet for a big city hotel . Le Bar staff was very friendly and the place has a good euro ##pe ##an v ##ibe . Great location and would highly recommend . The food at the hotel restaurant was excellent too ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love staying here . . . . the luxury , and the concern with which the staff treats their guests . I visit Chicago once a year , and never tire of staying here . Since it ' s right on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , you are close to everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We choose the O ##m ##ni because we had stayed a number of years ago with family and loved the location / quality . The room was not as well kept as in the past . . . wall ##paper in bathroom was dirty and furnishings were tired . The biggest problem was a the draft from the windows was so bad it felt like the air conditioning was on ! We had to place spare sheets against the windows so we could sleep . The comment from the front desk . . . corner suites are draft ##y . The restaurant staff , bell ##men , v ##alet and door ##men on the other hand were very professional and friendly . Will try another hotel on the Ma ##gi ##fic ##ent Mile next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Su ##pper nice staff , excellent location . The floors are sq ##ue ##ak ##y and you can hear the trains in the morning , but I guess it adds to the charm . I would definitely stay there again . Did I mention how great the staff was ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was for 13 nights changed rooms twice still same mistakes No s ##ham ##po ##o , corridors are not clean . Lounge used at night as a pizza parlor nobody is there to control . The place used to be for meet ##ii ##ng ##s now just big tables for big dinner ##s . There is one thing that is taken care ! ! Free ##zing temperatures on all hotel wherever you go you have to take a jacket in the middle of summer . No need to throw that amount of energy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had to park 5 blocks away in a parking garage and pay an additional $ 35 for parking in the garage . Obviously , I then had to walk 5 blocks with my luggage in the cold / rain / snow . When I tried to address this issue with the front desk staff , I was basically ignored . Upon my arrival around 5 : 00 PM , my room was not ready - even though check - in is at 3 : 00 PM . Again , I was simply told to wait in the corner and I would be told when my room would be ready . There was no urgency nor concern for my in ##con ##ven ##ience . There are so many other better hotels available than this one . Another odd q ##ui ##rk with this hotel is that the lobby is actually on the 20th floor ! Stay clear of this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##ma ##ck da ##b in the middle of the Gold Coast , everything you need is steps away . The Ambassador still has the beauty and so ##phi ##stic ##ation of the old days , but with a great e ##cle ##tic feel that makes you feel right at home in 2018 . Don ' t miss the b / w photos of celebrities in the P ##ump Room and Lower Level . [SEP]
0	[CLS] In the middle of the Chicago Marathon weekend the So ##fit ##el managed to provide superior service to those of us who were in Chicago for other reasons . I was impressed at every turn . The location was perfect , offering everything we needed within walking distance . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My recent stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago marked my 50th stay . This stay , like all those preceding this visit was outstanding , from arrival to departure the staff is consistently friendly and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The Chicago O ##m ##ni ' s suite style rooms are always inviting . The hotel ' s location provides easy access to Michigan Avenue ' s outstanding shopping and Chicago ' s great museums and restaurants . This O ##m ##ni property should be at the top of the list for a trip to the Wind ##y City . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I only needed an overnight , but The All ##egro made it most enjoyable . Great staff - treating Elite Level I ##H ##G loyalty members with extra attention ( which I very much appreciated ) ! Looking forward to another stay , when I ' m back in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is amazing . The staff is friendly , the rooms are spacious and luxurious . It is walking distance to places for breakfast , lunch and dinner . The con ##cier ##ge is helpful and has printed directions they will provide for you to use public transit to get to and from W ##rig ##ley Field . The hotel has a full size hair dry ##er in the room , it worked but wasn ’ t very powerful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I really wanted to give this hotel 3 . 5 stars . It ' s not bad , it ' s just not what I expect from Kim ##pton . The service was great - as it usually is with this brand . But , I was disappointed by our room . It wasn ' t that different from a Mar ##riot ##t or a West ##in . Kim ##pton rooms usually have so much personality and are so unique and distinct . This room was fairly under ##w ##hel ##ming . That being said the location is amazing and as mentioned , service is great ! Ex ##cite ##d to check out the Gray Hotel sometime ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My son and I traveled to Chicago for spring break and stayed at the So ##fit ##el for 5 nights . From the welcoming reception to the lovely room we enjoyed on the 26th floor , we loved every moment of our stay here . The highlight was coming back after a long day on walking all over town to soft classical music and a relaxing well made room waiting for us to relax . Love ##d their line of toilet ##ries and the nicely appointed spacious bathroom . Excellent location , great restaurants around the hotel , easy , easy , easy all the way . Would absolutely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing hotel in a very nice location ! Rate ##s are very affordable throughout the winter season and you definitely get your money ' s worth . The de ##cor is modern and ch ##ic without being too over ##be ##aring or pre ##ten ##ti ##ous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came into Chicago early before our conference to explore around . The She ##rato ##n was central ##ly located for our purposes and worked great . Paula our con ##cier ##ge worked magic for us , she made some great dinner reservations for us . Our room was clean , in great condition and had a great view of the Navy Pier and the Lake . We would return when in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Poor guest service - staff not at ##ten ##tive or show a will ##ling ##ness to welcome a guest . This goes for the front desk staff to the bar staff . Poor supplies in the room . Wouldn ’ t recommend . P ##lent ##y of other options within a block or two . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed room with 2 beds for two nights and told on arrival , we could only get 2 beds with an upgrade at $ 30 . 00 more per night . After check in , found an internet offer of two beds at $ 50 . 00 less than we were charged . Re ##fused to adjust upon check ##out . Really disappointing ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have never had a problem with this hotel , that their staff couldn ’ t fix . Everything and everyone working there , are always satisfactory ! Though the breakfast b ##uff ##et is a bit price ##y , for how much I can eat , it ’ s worth it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is well situated in Downtown Chicago right by the magnificent mile . Taking up to an hour depending a lot on the traffic from the airport . The hotel itself feels old most of the colours are be ##ige or brown and whilst well maintained looks worn . You need to get a lift to the reception and then a second lift to get to your room every time you leave or arrive at the hotel . The hotel also has no gym or of it does it is well hidden ! The rooms are well sized and comfortable and the room service food is really good . There are so many great hotels in Chicago it ' s difficult to pick this one out . However if you find yourself there you will be quite alright . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were visiting family here in Chicago and decided to stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Upon arrival we were greeted with smiles and laughter ! The Front Des ##k agents were Amazing and Full of Ch ##eer . When we stated that we were first time ##rs the Bell At ##tend ##ant smiled and informed us that he was " The New Guy " and that " H ##E GE ##T IT " ( Also explaining the Ki ##nz ##ie motto ) " SM ##IL ##E " way to go Ki ##nz ##ie , great selection ! The staff are second to none . The rooms are amazing and the location is a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! We look forward to our return in the near future ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our group of four couples stayed here the last weekend in July . We absolutely loved it , rooms were very spacious , loved the ##break ##fast and happy hour ! Staff was very court ##eous and the hotel was very clean and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Great location ! We would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Public for a weekend event . It was nice but " screamed " old . The rooms were very small and crow ##ed . The room was down a very narrow hall , there were no hand rails in the bathroom . The bathroom was not fan vent ##ed , which caused wet walls and floor during shower ##ing . If you need a disability compatible room , make sure yours is before you check in . On the good side , the staff is nice , the special event we attended went very well , Check you available room rate price , they tend to flu ##ct ##uate . Also , parking is $ 54 per night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not recommended . Unlike most modern hotels there is no system to prevent in ##truder ##s access ##ing upper floors at this hotel . We had a walk - in theft while we were sleeping . This was reported to management but no response other than they were ' working on ' improving security systems . have been left with a distinct opinion that management would rather not deal with the problem . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sen ##t to Chicago for a conference and decided to extend and spend time exploring the city . This hotel was well situated for easy access to all the sights and returning to the room definitely helped that mental transition to turn off work mode and relax . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and staff ! Co ##m ##fort ##able bed ##ding was able to get a good nights sleep . Stay ##ed here last year and liked it well enough to stay again . Could use more lighting in the rooms if you don ' t have a corner room . Sleep ##er sofa could use updated or cleaned . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First time to Chicago and it was a f ##abulous experience staying at the O ##m ##ni . Staff , accommodation ##s , restaurant and location were perfect . I would definitely recommend the O ##m ##ni - Chicago to others . I hope to get back for another visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every suite has a kitchen well equipped - clean , comfortable beds , no problem with noise , just like home comfort . Location is excellent if you want to walk all around downtown and along river walks - very close to all attractions and amazing restaurants if you like to walk . Custom ##er service and staff wonderful - great breakfast . Would stay again in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] These dude ##s went above and beyond for sure . My wife and I stayed here after a bad car accident and these two were incredibly compassion ##ate and court ##eous . Give these guys a raise for sure ! Will return just b ##c of how pleasant they made our first unexpected stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Older hotel but the rooms are updated and very comfortable and the beds were excellent . Excellent value for Chicago . The staff was very court ##eous and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The parking is expensive ( $ 67 per day ) but that is in line with other hotels . The restaurant is open for breakfast and lunch only . We did not try it . Internet in the room will cost an extra $ 11 per day ( we used our hot ##sp ##ot ) . Overall , we were very satisfied . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great rooms , great staff . Corner room offering view of river and navy pier . Check in was under staffed and took too long . A ##ble to exit hotel onto river walk . N ##eg ##ative was the cost of parking on ##site . Way too expensive ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing experience at a Hotel I use to really enjoy . Was told at check in that my mandatory Resort fee includes W ##i ##F ##i , fitness facilities and free morning coffee . What no one explained is that the free ( but actually paid for ) coffee is only available from 4 : 00 ##a - 6 : 00 ##a . Think about that . Not only that insult but they actually , hurriedly break it down at 5 : 55 ##a ! ! We found this out at 5 : 50 ##a as we grabbed our second “ free cup ” All that with the now closed lower level restaurant with the amazing breakfast ##s , I see now reason to return . Too many better options at this price point . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal because nothing went wrong . The location , the pool , the restaurants - - everything was nice and there were no problems . You may wish to park nearby since the daily rate is $ 71 not including tax . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able stay but needs some elegant touches and compliment ##ary toilet ##ries . No ice machines on floors , so it would be nice to provide ice night ##ly . We had to call for ice . No compliment ##ary bottle of water . And no turn down service which adds a persona ##ble and elegant touch to the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located near Michigan avenue and close to main stores and meeting places . The staff is very friendly , breakfast had good alternatives for all . Great coffee , c ##ran ##berry and orange juice are also available . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I spent a lot of time looking for the perfect Chicago Hotel . I was hoping for modern , room ##y , sleek with a big bathroom , great lighting and comfortable bed ##ding . The Conrad was all of that and more ! I look forward to a return visit . I also felt very safe at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel Monaco has everything one could ask for : ideal location , excellent staff , a very good restaurant , plus it covers all the basic ##s extremely well . Lots of hotels but this one nails it in my opinion . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay was for a business conference so I didn ' t spend much time in the room . However , the room was clean and t ##idy , albeit an bit small ##ish for my liking . It is downtown so it ' s just a short walk from many places you might want . My one complaint is the TV . The picture s ##tun ##k for what is supposed to be high definition . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were there for two nights and would stay there again . The location was great , walking distance to restaurants , shopping , The Loop and other attractions . The rooms were spacious , comfortable bed and very friendly staff . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Touring the Hilton Chicago hotel was a highlight of our time in Chicago . Lots of history and interesting facts , photos and fun artifacts from the past as well as a chance to see the beautiful grand ballroom . J ##ac ##inda and Annie did a wonderful job of showing us the timeline of events and were very knowledge ##able about the history of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were there the night of the mayor race for Chicago , so it was pan ##de ##mon ##ium . Class ##y hotel . . . . . . except for elevators . hard to figure out which floor , which elevator . . . which one to get on . Nice rooms , clean . . . notice I did not say quiet . I was woke up every time the maid knocked on other peoples doors to clean . Great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the So ##fit ##el except we had to wait 2 hours for our room . Even at that time , the desk never called us as they said they would . We were disappointed with that service . The room was great , except the refrigerator was not working the express ##o machine was a disaster . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel . Easy access to everything , good rates , great spacious rooms . I have stayed here for years . Close to theaters , train station and shopping . You can walk all over downtown and even to the Water Tower district . Bus ##es are easy , along with taxi ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really like this hotel . The rooms are spot ##lessly clean and fresh , the beds are comfortable , the linen ##s pressed and the towels are fresh & flu ##ffy . Combined with the prime location on the North side just across from The Drake , just one block from Michigan Ave makes this the ideal hotel for a visit that enables shopping , restaurants and sight seeing . Like most hotels , many amenities have been shut ##tered , but The hotel is very competitive priced . Note : They do add a daily $ 15 “ Co ##vid ” fee to the bill , but it still a very reasonably priced for the value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Free breakfast and social hour + super nice and clean rooms for a very affordable price . I would stay here again for sure . I normally stay closer to W ##ack ##er street due to my office location but this place is nice and I would com ##mu ##te again as needed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a one night stay and would definitely stay here again . The hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful at the check - in desk and at the breakfast and evening social . The 2 - room suite was spacious and pleasant . Bath ##room was tiny and had a must ##y odor . Quiet and cool for a good night ' s sleep . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a great stay while in Chicago ! The hotel was clean , staff was friendly and it was close to everything we wanted to do . The hotel had just reopened 3 weeks prior , but it didn ' t seem like they ever closed . Overall a really great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago for 6 nights in Chicago . It is a wonderful and relatively new hotel . It is located just a half of a block off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ( Michigan Avenue ) and is in walking distance to most of Chicago ' s sites . The room was very large with a king bed , a sofa and a very large bathroom with two sinks and separate areas for both the shower and the toilet . We had a view of Michigan Avenue . The staff are exceeding ##ly friendly , so ##licit ##ous , and helpful . It was a superb choice and the price we received was great . We would definitely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fun trip and good hotel experience overall except I had issues 1 day with house ##keeping getting my room cleaned . I enjoyed the locations close proximity to the parks and great quick service food spots . [SEP]
1	[CLS] She ##rato ##n Grand is located in within easy walk of Navy Pier , Ma ##g . Mile , several good restaurants and entertainment . It sits right on the river ##walk with access to outdoor seating and dining . Beautiful view of Navy Pier and the lake from my room on 33rd floor . Although the hotel was quite busy , there was no wait for the elevator , or for luggage services , when I stored my luggage , as my room wasn ' t ready . They did have a room for me by 2 : 00 ( I was super war ##ly ( and I was notified by text . . Nice room , large , com ##fy bed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal this week , and it was less than I expected . Nothing ho ##rre ##ndo ##us . Close ##t in my room did not want to stay closed . I got up in the morning and went to make myself a cup of coffee with the Ku ##eri ##g machine . But no cups . I looked up and down the hallway for a housekeeper , but none about . I called the hotel operator who was extremely a ##pol ##og ##etic and who said she ' d send someone with cups right away . But an hour later , nobody had arrived . Not a crack ##er ##jack operation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the O ##m ##ni over Thanksgiving week on a family trip . The rooms were beautiful and a great size for a family with three kids . . . having the separate sitting room and bedroom was ideal . My kids loved the pool and swam every night we stayed . . . I mostly used the hot tub . The staff was the best part of this hotel , though . Everyone was so incredibly welcoming , helpful , and just pleasant to deal with from the v ##alet to the managers . We wouldn ' t hesitate to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As I was checking in , I told the guy who was checking in me , that I have booked the room with breakfast . This guy goes " we do not provide F ##RE ##E breakfast to our guests " . I told him I booked my room with breakfast . He goes " I do not see in our record " . I had to take out my booking confirmation email from booking ##s . com . At that point , he was already angry at me and he did not even consider my request for a room with a river view . This was my 5th times staying with She ##rato ##n Grand . But this is my last stay with them . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the minute I booked my reservation with Alicia to the minute I left , the Talbot ##t staff made my first visit to their hotel an imp ##ec ##ca ##ble experience . The room was extraordinary . The service was phenomena ##l . Alicia personally made my stay better than I could have anticipated . Need ##less to say , I am coming back and plan on having the hotel also host several of our key guests for Expo Chicago and our Charity Art Au ##ction this fall . Great value and bout ##ique fl ##air . A total joy of Chicago in one of the best areas of the City . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is my youngest daughter ' s favorite in all of Chicago . Mostly for the fantastic window seats but also for the hotel staff . Last year they upgraded us for her birthday but this year they didn ' t . She was disappointed but soon got over it . I love Kim ##pton properties for their q ##ui ##rkin ##ess and co ##zy rooms . And of course their cool robes ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] i loved this hotel , and glad i chose it . I was there only one night for business but i did not have to sacrifice style , el ##egan ##ce or room to plug in and work - for a cookie cutter generic city hotel . easy to find , parking was a bit expensive - very quiet for being on a busy street . the rooms are small but very well appointed , arts ##y , lovely furniture and made me want to move in as a pie ##d a te ##rre . Downs ##ide : PA ##R ##K ##ING was over ##p ##rice ##d , at $ 63 / night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not sure if I had a special promotional rate , but the room rate was te ##rri ##fic . I had a 2 queen bed on 10th floor . Good size room , spacious bathroom , high ceilings , big windows . I had trouble mastering the light switches and would prefer better lighting at bed side . Check in and out was a breeze . C ##ur ##b side service was pleasant and efficient . Great locations , steps from Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is a good location however if you ’ ve stayed in Swiss ##ote ##l hotels in Asia or Europe and expecting European / Asia service / standards you ’ ll be mistaken . . The rooms are clean and to EU design , but customer service and front of house differ massive ##ly from the Swiss ##ote ##l EU / Asia experience - it ’ s the small things that make a difference . . Being greeted with a smile at check ##in , having your room made in the morning , fresh towels and milk and coffee without having to request them or in the case of milk pay for it ! We were charged $ 14 for a small glass of milk for tea . Swiss ##ote ##l hotels in Asia are perfect and I ’ ve never had any complaints . Whilst the location of this hotel is good I wouldn ’ t stay again next time in Chicago . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In the past we have stayed in another nearby Chicago hotel , but the So ##fit ##el was more than a step above . The front desk personnel were cheerful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . they upgraded us to a del ##uxe room for our anniversary ( 20th floor ) . The room was gorgeous with a nice view of the city , a co ##zy ch ##ais ##e lounge . The bathroom was fantastic with plus ##h towels , robe and slip ##pers and pleasant smelling products . The bed was very comfortable and temperature control and air pu ##ri ##fie ##r in room made for a wonderful stay . We had breakfast in the restaurant and the food and service were good . Will definitely stay again in our frequent trips to Chicago area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff is great and very welcoming . The rooms are super clean and comfortable . The location couldn ' t get better , next to every restaurant and shop . Walking distance to Michigan Ave and parks . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here August 30 to September 1st . And from the moment we walked through the doors were treated with excellent service , nothing was too much bother for them . Well worth staying here , close to everything and you feel safe walking around . Breakfast is great and if there ’ s something you want that ’ s not on the menu or in the b ##uff ##et area ask and they will accommodate you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Never give reviews . But this place deserves it . Ku ##dos to the ca ##ul ##ker . The craft ##manship is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . Love staying in a place that ' s in better shape than my house . Doesn ' t happen that often . Thanks for the experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I truly enjoy coming to this hotel and love the room updates ! The bed was comfortable and the bathroom extremely clean . I appreciate having a mini - fridge to a ##cco ##men ##date left ##overs and water . Being able to view your bill on the television is a bonus ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t is an incredible value - spacious room , at ##ten ##tive staff , excellent food , and in a location that is central to just about everything ( Lincoln Park , Mill ##eni ##um Park , Navy Pier , the Lakes ##hore , River ##walk . . . ) We were in town for my girlfriend ' s birthday and the Talbot ##t made a great impression - beginning with the o ##asis of trees in front of the hotel after U ##bering from Midway . After a walking tour , we returned to have apps at the outdoor cafe , which were incredible . The staff , un ##sol ##icit ##edly , brought out a delicious piece of birthday cake . We subsequently ate two breakfast ##s outside as well - great food , service , and people watching . I don ' t say this lightly - I can ' t imagine staying anywhere else in Chicago from now on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is great for a little romantic get ##away . Downtown close to everything walking or a short U ##ber ride away . It ' s an older hotel with great architectural design . The rooms are co ##zy and the air jet bath ##tub was amazing ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was here for a conference . Beautiful historic meeting rooms . The staff was friendly . Room ##s were average . The air seemed to be building controlled and not room controlled and the room was warm and uncomfortable . The hotel is right on Michigan Avenue close to shopping and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this Fair ##mont Hotel . Really great location ; close to everything . We booked the Fair ##mont Gold category , this gives you breakfast , and snack ##s ( they offer app ##eti ##zers in the evening and desert ##s after 8 PM ) . Love ##ly club , and spent a lot of time there . The room was lovely and spacious . The staff at the hotel really took care of us , and we really enjoyed our entire stay . Walking distance to the Navy Pier , movies and what - have - you . Don ' t hesitate to stay here . Going there again next time . I love Fair ##mont ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was deck ##ed out for the holidays - always a treat to see . It ' s in the Chicago Loop this hotel is close to just about everything . The bed comfort is very nice . The room was very quiet except for the external city street noises of the L and construction . S ##nac ##ks for purchase are in the room , but there is no coffee maker , no fridge or microwave . The electrical outlets on my desk lamp base did not work and I left a note - two days later it was repaired . I love the ma ##gni ##fie ##r mirror in the bathroom . I also thought the room was cool , even though my the ##rm ##ost ##at was set on 74 , it felt like the room remained about 68 all the time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed five nights for a conference and sights ##ee ##ing . We decided to s ##p ##lu ##rge so we booked a suite on the 26th Floor . The first room was spacious but was missing a curtain in the living area thereby the sun woke us up in the bedroom with no door . Lo ##bby Ambassador Te ##ks ##te G ##eb ##res ##ela ##sse personally found us a new room that had both curtains and a spectacular view of the historic clock tower . The room was quiet as a recording studio . We were very impressed with his effort . The hotel is located about a mile from the Art Institute and the theaters and about half a mile to Navy Pier with its new high f ##er ##ris wheel . Of course the stores are located very close in every directions . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am the President of Hospital Pro ##ced ##ures Consul ##tant ##s and we hold medical conferences at luxury hotels across the country . We have held medical conferences at nearly 50 hotels at major cities across the country and our experience at the Swiss ##ote ##l was second to none . The customer service , beautiful layout , exquisite guest rooms and proximity to downtown Chicago made for a wonderful experience . High ##ly recommend this hotel for any meeting plan ##ner looking for a home base in Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a beautiful hotel . Great location and a great view of the city . I would recommend this hotel to anyone . Check in is late and be aware rooms might not be ready . Use the app and you can digitally check in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall a good experience , but several mi ##s ##cue ##s in service created some frustration . Did not include a co ##rk screw or napkin ##s in room service order of $ 100 + . Only one chair was in the room for a queen del ##uxe room . Hotel had multiple closure ##s for private events , so we sought out other venues which were great in this area of Chicago . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was down ##heart ##ed when I arrived at Midway and S ##WA had lost my luggage , but once I got to the hotel I felt at peace . Everyone was kind and helpful . A special thanks to Drake Lu ##k ##wa ##go and Guadalupe A ##cos ##ta who may not know how much their kindness meant to me . After a day and a half my luggage arrived and I was back in the swing of my business trip . Breakfast , cocktail hour and room were all fantastic . Of course the City is so walk ##able and Ki ##nz ##ie is near everything , but out of noise range . I certainly recommend the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is amazing . Wonderful staff great room all around fantastic service . We drove here and the car was put to their v ##alet service which is reasonable priced as Chicago is ##int a cheap place to park your car . We had breakfast here at the restaurant and drinks from the bar both very nice . Everyone there really want to help you have the best stay possible . Craig was very knowledge ##able and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for business . I was there for 11 nights . The room was perfect and the staff was friendly and helpful . The location of the hotel allowed me to walk to nice restaurants and gift shops . I hope to stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel . Great location . Our issue was room temperature ! It was so hot in our room we were sweating . The ##rm ##ost ##at was locked so couldn ’ t adjust . Called the front desk to be told only the engineer could over ride the setting but he was already gone for the night . We only went to the city for one night and having NO SL ##EE ##P completely ruined our anniversary stay ! For the money I wouldn ’ t take a chance to book here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed 6 days at the hotel Monaco and had a fantastic stay . The room was clean and com ##fy . It ' s in a great spot , within walking distance of The River ##walk and Art Institute . The best part though is the staff . From check - in to check - out , the desk clerk ##s , door ##men , waits ##ta ##ff and house ##keeping really take care of you and make you feel at home . It was a pleasure to day here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had an very pleasant time at the Conrad . The hotel has an amazing location right downtown on River North . The staff is excellent and very helpful . On the third night I wanted to switch rooms as I was having a friend join me . They were able to accommodate me . From check in to check ##out everything was seem ##less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is in a great location on Michigan Ave . We stayed in an upper floor facing Michigan Ave . and enjoyed our view . Pool is gorgeous and good restaurants on site . Love the historic architecture . Easy underground parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited Chicago for our 10 year wedding anniversary and stayed at the O ##m ##ni because of its location and reasonable price . The hotel is right along the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and less the a mile from the Navy Pier . We were able to check in early which was nice , but our room was on the 5th floor and there was a common large balcony right out our windows ( luck ##ily it was not used much ) . The rooms were very clean . The bath ##tub drain long to drain , But good the bathroom was nice . Great employees ! Restaurant in the hotel with a full bar . We took a taxi from the airport and U ##ber around town as needed . A ##wes ##ome hotel and location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best hotel we have been in for a while . Staff all helpful especially the reception , con ##cier ##ge and door ##man . Room was spot ##less , spacious with com ##fy king size bed . En ##joy ##ed the compliment ##ary glass of wine and the tea / coffee in the lounge each morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve had the pleasure of staying at the Kim ##pton All ##egro for a full week every month of 2019 so far , and I couldn ' t be happier with the location , staff and service . It starts with the support staff that always makes me feel welcome , and that checks in with me every now and then throughout the week to see if I need anything . The Bell Team is always super helpful and has great tips on what sights should not be missed in the city . And then there ' s the lobby bar and their staff . Luc ##ie always gives me the warm ##est welcome , knows what I ' m about to order , and has been greeting me by my first name since the very beginning , after I had only been staying at the hotel for a week . Can ' t wait to go back next month , and to have a drink at the lobby bar with my favorite bartender ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in the heart of Chicago , close to Lake Michigan , with L ##OT ##S of history . Suite ##s were a bit " dark " but I liked it . P ##lent ##y of bars and restaurants nearby . This hotel is great if you want to be in downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family took a short , overnight trip to downtown Chicago . The H ##ya ##tt has an awesome staff and location . The room was clean and comfortable . We would definitely visit this hotel again . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is my favorite hotel to stay at in Chicago . The atmosphere is charming and very inviting . Room ##s are spacious and extremely comfortable and the bathroom is quite large with a spacious counter ##top . The food is great and the room service was f ##abulous ! The O ##m ##ni Hotel is in prime location for great shopping , sights ##ee ##ing and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time at a Fair ##mont and they did a great job of making me feel welcome . The people at the desk were kind and the guys out front were extremely friendly ! The room was not large , but nice . I tried the restaurant and they had great fish and chips . Scott [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for two days - has been re ##mo ##dell ##ed since I last stayed here . Is now amazing ! really friendly and helpful staff , the reception area and food area now looks so bright and clean . Room ##s spot ##less and again look brighter with the lighter colored tiles . Absolutely loved it - will be one of my " definite stays " when back in Chicago . I had a room on the top floor overlooking the W ##rig ##ley Building which is lit up at night . Bed super comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here many many times and each stay was as good as the last ! Staff are very friendly and helpful . Hotel is stunning and rooms are comfortable . The hotel bar in main foyer is my favorite place to have a tip ##ple before hitting Chicago . The Bean is a nice walk away along the magnificent mile . The hotel also does a tour of the building , which surprisingly , I have never done ! I wouldn ##t stay at any other hotel when in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel near the magnificent mile , though the rooms are small , walls are thin , no room service , and there is a daily charge for w ##i - fi . There are other hotels in the same price range , same area that offer a modern upgrade . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable hotel , excellent bar and kind wait - staff . Con ##ven ##ient location on Michigan Ave . Very good location to visit Art Institute of Chicago , Museum of Contemporary Art , or to take a walking or river tour . Excellent access to major businesses , University of Chicago readily accessible via the # 6 Jackson Park Express , 20 minute ride . Get a bus card at any W ##al ##green ##s . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Being unfamiliar with Chicago , I had a lot of questions for the staff . They went out of their way to give me good directions and were cu ##rt ##ious and friendly ! The hotel was clean and amenities were great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location makes for some great views ( you ' re right on the river and higher - up floors have a view of the lake , too ) . Room was just fine : Clean , fairly modern , and quiet . Nice ##st hotel gym ( in terms of space , amenities and view ) that I ' ve ever used . Location is a bit out of the way if you ' re trying to use the El for most of your travel . But cab ##s / U ##bers were p ##lent ##iful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is now our preferred hotel when staying in Chicago . Why ? It ' s the perfect location on Michigan Avenue , the suites are great , breakfast is f ##abulous and so is dinner ( both reasonably priced ) . It has a nice gym and a pool , which we enjoy using . And Z ##ara ' s is directly opposite the hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Palmer House for a friends ' reunion and it was perfect for our needs and great value . The lobby is gorgeous and I love that the hotel is a rabbit war ##ren of rooms and corridors . We had a look around the extensive network of ball and meeting rooms with an eye to a future event . My room was comfortable although the bathroom was tiny and the shower pressure not great . I expect the floor ##p ##lan ##s vary greatly in an old building like this . I was very pleased the reception ##ist recognised my Hilton Honors Gold status and gave me water and w ##if ##i , even though I had booked a deal with a 3rd party vendor . I certainly recommend for the location and the value for the level of quality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Extreme ##ly professional staff . Check - in a breeze and inform ##ative . Room ##s very clean with nice amenities and layout . King bed , lounge chair , fridge , in room safe , coffee maker , robes , slip ##pers , desk . On site restaurant and bar . 24 hour fitness center also . Very quite room and comfortable bed . I will definitely consider staying here again if back in the Chicago area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A classic returns . After a brief fl ##ing as “ Public ” ; The Ambassador is back . The brief experiment as a hip place ( Public ) felt as p ##hon ##y as a bad face ##lift on an 85 y ##r . old . Returning to its roots , consistent with its neighborhood setting , is where the grand old hotel belongs . S ##hame on Sc ##hra ##ger for not allowing the building to use the name , P ##ump Room . Like the Hotel , this room was a classic part of Chicago lo ##re . The staff was g ##rac ##ious and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting as they have been for the 36 y ##rs . I have been staying there . They do need to jet ##tis ##on the hideous blonde , “ modern ” room furniture and the uncomfortable in - room couch ##es . Some overs ##tu ##ffed classic furniture would be more consistent with the building ’ s character . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we walked in , I knew our family was going to enjoy this stay . We were greeted by well - trained professionals , the check - in process was smooth and efficient , and the rooms were modern and clean . In comparison with other hotels in Chicago , the Conrad offered excellent value for our dollar . The lounge / restaurant on the 20th floor was warm and inviting . Could not have been happier . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el Chicago is my favorite hotel in Chicago . There are enough European touches that it e ##voke ##s past time spent in France . Was there during Chicago Restaurant Week and had an amazing dinner . Room ##s are nicely appointed . Fantastic location , without being in heavy traffic [SEP]
1	[CLS] Whatever you do , don ' t sign up for the Ambassador program ! ! ! ! ! Complete ##ly useless and waste of money . My upgrade was not any different than the one I would have had . The free in room movie was still charged on my account . I tried to use the free weekend night in December and could NO ##T ! ! ! ! Save your money [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was friendly . Room was relocated to a different hotel however they were super a ##pol ##og ##etic . We had to walk a few blocks at night when we checked into the other hotel but everything was fine . Staff was extremely friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They even helped grab McDonald ##s for us ! Everything was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , clean , great amenities , f ##abulous staff - however after staying in room 311 ##7 I ' m leaving having not had too much sleep . I got woke up during the early hours of the morning each night due to in ##con ##side ##rate guests . I called to complain and the staff were helpful and offered to change my room . I declined the offer as we were only there for four days , had a lot of luggage and shopping and a tight schedule and it would ' ve been a lot of has ##sle to move . After this I felt I didn ' t have the right to complain again as they had offered a suitable resolution to my issue and I had declined . I ' m sorry this damp ##ened our stay and it wouldn ' t stop me from recommend ##ing this hotel as the location was also incredible ! Thank you for having us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is excellent we had a great stay . Would highly recommend it . Service was excellent . We went to the American girl store the location of the hotel was perfect . We used the pool which was so fun for the kids . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We returned to see Hamilton a second time for my birthday , and just had to stay here again . We were definitely not disappointed . The staff was delight ##fully friendly and helpful , the room beautiful and im ##ma ##culate , the location convenient , and the wine tasting a treat . This time our room had the window seat , which was a great place to relax and watch the activity below . This is now officially our Chicago hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] although I rated the property as average , it is a nice facility in a convenient location . I was there for a work conference of a fairly large group . The reason I only rated average is due to long lines at check in with only one clerk , long wait for bell ##man to retrieve bags while trying to catch ride to airport and the high cost of the stay . The rates are in line with competition but the value for the money was not there for me . the conference food was just so - so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here for a conference and thought the hotel was laid out nicely for the event . The rooms are nice although non ##des ##cript . I can ' t even remember the details too much now . They have nice areas for sitting outside and you can walk to the big water arch that shoots out over the river at certain times . It ' s a very nice location . You can also walk to the Navy Pier easily . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and amenities . B ##rough ##t two ram ##bu ##nc ##ti ##ous to ##ddler ##s with me and the services available kept us all sa ##ne . Large clean suite , kitchen facilities and helpful staff . Price can ' t be beat for the quality and services . Breakfast was busy but it ' s included in the room rate and y ##um ##my ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were upgraded to room 141 ##5 a corner room that was spacious enough for our family of 4 . Love ##d the window seats ! Our teenager was able to make a bed in one of the window seats . Hu ##ge bonus . They were filming Chicago Fire below us ! Another unexpected bonus . It is right on the river and walking distance to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Very noisy but the views and location were worth the city noises . Would absolutely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the door ##man and bell hop ##s to the front desk - everyone was extremely polite and helpful . The door ##man helped me locate an open parking lot to park our car , which had a travel shell mounted on the top and prevented us from parking in the hotel garage . The front desk gave my kids little good ##ie bags and water on arrival which was very unexpected and excellent first impression . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As a former SP ##G platinum , I have yet to experience service that has w ##owed me like SP ##G used to do - but I have now found my place . The Kim ##pton is a beautiful space with friendly staff . Leah was a delight at the front desk and the room was modern and clean . I love the yoga mat ##s in the room and sip ##ping the compliment ##ary bubbles in the co ##zy lobby at the happy hour . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend this spot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recent 3 day stay at Intercontinental was excellent . Personnel are court ##eous and helpful throughout . Public areas of hotel are old , but well maintained . Room ##s are superb ##ly outfit ##ted and comfortable . On site restaurants are also excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Date ##d and s ##hab ##by . Very unlike the Fair ##mont locations I ’ m used to . The head ##board was p ##eel ##ing and the chairs were stained . Down at the heel . The bed was comfortable and the view from my corner room was nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A big hotel with a dedicated staff that truly wants to make your stay a great one . Have to call out Melissa at the desk , Matt at the bar in Shu ##la ’ s and Paula at con ##cier ##ge . The Chicago marathon was starting at the time we were to depart and Paula made certain we had a ride set up ( at a great price ) with someone who knew how to get around the race route . She even checked in during the trip to make certain all was going well ! First class ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] i had the greatest stay here while in town on a business trip - t ##ra ##vis took the best care of me . such comfortable beds , great black ##out curtains , co ##zy bar . i ’ d not want to stay anywhere else in ch ##ica ##go ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is amazing ! We could walk just about everywhere we needed to go . Perfect for shopping and meals . Bed ##s were super com ##fy and the black ##out shades were nice . The room was super clean and the AC worked great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I always look forward to my stays at the Fair ##mont ! I had never been to the Chicago location and it was absolutely stunning ! This beautiful hotel is right in the center of everything you will want to do in Chicago ! We also enjoyed a fantastic meal in there gas ##tro ##pu ##b the Columbus Ta ##p ! Can ' t wait to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In general , this hotel was over ##p ##rice ##d and over ##rated . The rooms were small and cramped , amenities were lacking , and most of the staff provided rude service . They need to re ##tra ##in their staff to understand what the hospitality industry is . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location for walking to downtown attractions . The staff were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . For ##got our cell phone charge ##r and they were able to provide us with one . Free coffee in the morning in the lobby . We had a room facing the water . Love ##d the window box seat for watching life go by . The only thing negative is the shower curtain in the tub vs a glass sliding door . Otherwise all was perfect . Re ##com ##men ##d going around the corner to the rooftop bar at London House - amazing views ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very affordable great location hotel . Friendly , helpful staff . We are using the O ##m ##ni hotels all over US and we find the same high quality and friendly staff whenever we use O ##m ##ni . especially their loyalty ambassador ##s is of great help with their experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] comfortable and reasonable price in the district . Good staff . Clean and co ##sy place . Very recommend . I was on a business conference just right across the road . to book a room on that hotel was too expensive so i found out this option and it was right choice [SEP]
0	[CLS] On a recent stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago I accidentally left some items of clothing and several pieces of jewelry in a drawer of our hotel room when i checked out . I didn ' t discover this until a week later and I was very pleased and relieved to find that it was in the lost and found . I was impressed with the customer care I received from Don ##te and Colin in the hotel ' s lost and found . They were very nice , di ##ligent in lo ##cating the items and made it very easy to get them back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was worried after reading negative reviews . Hotel is in a perfect location . Staff was friendly and helpful . Understanding the Co ##vid procedure for cleaning , we put out our trash and swap ##ped for clean towels . House ##keeping stayed on top of our requests . We loved having a kitchen ##ette especially since we had to eat breakfast in our room . I called hotel the day before to ensure we got a corner room on a higher floor . Staff did good considering the th ##rong ##s of guests that arrived for the holiday weekend . We were happy on a higher floor where guests behave ##d themselves . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay here just about every time I ' m in Chicago . The staff brings me back . Everyone is awesome and I see the same faces when I come back . Make sure you check Kim ##pton ' s social media for the password of the season . Amazing views as well . Make sure to ask for a room with a city view , and hopefully you get one with the window seat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located in Chicago to everything . Friendly , helpful employees . Room ##s very clean . Restaurant at hotel should be 5 * , one of the best diner ##s I had in Chicago . Breakfast good also ! Reason ##ably $ $ $ . Would definitely stay there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful new hotel . Great service with easy check in . Room was clean and bed was comfortable . Everything in working order . Read ##ily available hand sa ##ni ##ti ##zer throughout . Spa ##cious fitness room with wide array of card ##io and weights . The TV ##s on the el ##liptic ##als didn ' t work , otherwise , great . Nice bar with good service . Didn ' t eat at restaurant or use parking . Location is superb with easy walking to dining and shopping . [SEP]
0	[CLS] B ##re was un ##believable to talk to today . She was so persona ##ble and really took care of the specific ##s when it came down to planning my upcoming event . B ##re was able to answer all of my questions , and anything I needed , this hotel will make sure you have it ! I haven ’ t even gone to my own event yet , but the attention to detail already in the initial phone call , has me confident for when it finally happens ! High ##ly recommend for any event . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For price paid , room was sub ##par . H ##VA ##C system was not working properly . Te ##mper ##ature regulation in the room was too warm . Finally had to crack a window during our stay to cool down the room . Maintenance found nothing wrong with the system , however , it did not work properly . She ##et and towels were stiff and " scratch ##y . " Bath ##room mirror frame and ceiling had areas that looked like mold . ON a positive note , the cleaning staff was excellent . Ex ##pect ##ations for a Hilton property were much higher than what we experienced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was absolutely Beautiful . All of the staff were kind & helpful . Great location ! V ##isi ##ted the Spa also and that was amazing . I can ' t think of a more historic & beautiful place to stay in Chicago ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I wanted to com ##men ##d , Parker , at the con ##cier ##ge desk for his knowledge and friend ##liness with my questions ! Great service ! I look forward to my next visit . This is a lovely hotel property and te ##rri ##fic location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is lovely , quite old fashioned , rooms are lovely great beds and pillows , try a snack in the coffee bar they were enormous , the B ##LT was lovely , but the staff are what makes this place so wonderful , we had a family emergency and had to leave early , they couldn ' t do enough to help us , the staff in the coffee shop gave us a table for us to base ourselves on and kept us supplied with coffee the lady from the office did f ##ax ##ing for us , phone ##d airlines for us everything , they couldn ' t do enough , i hope they receive the kindness someday that they extended to us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel lobby was very f ##estive and lively at wine hour , we always meet interested guest during any wine hour at any Kim ##pton , but The All ##egro this night was great . After returning from our night out we returned to the lobby bar ( I don ' t remember the name of the bar ) and once again had a great time and the bartender ##s were the best . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a nice surprise when i checked in to my room . I found a greeting card for my upcoming birthday and some fur ##its covered with chocolate and some mixed n ##uit ##s . The staff was great and helpful . It ' s easy to go ##u around , about 5 minute walking to Michigan A ##v . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 1st time here ! Love ##d it , great view of Mi ##ch a ##ve . Right behind the new Star ##bu ##cks Reserve & close to everything . Room was nice , everyone was court ##eous & friendly . All the hotels in the area are price ##y so we felt this was great for the price ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I enjoyed a quick get ##away and the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker was perfect for that . The room was a great value , but very small . We didn ' t mind because we were out and about most of the time . But it ' s something to consider . [SEP]
1	[CLS] St ##ain ##s on carpet that had been very recently treated ( still wet ) - which explained the chemical smell the first night . Only two towels provided , despite the room being booked for two adults and a child . Sign ##ificant amount charged to my de ##bit card for incident ##als without prior warning and details of the amount being charged . Having tied up my only access to cash ( for the entire period of my stay and a further three days thereafter , I requested that they immediately reverse and take a credit card instead . They advised that " system would not allow them to " . There explanation for not telling me that they would be blocking funds and how much : " it ' s typical " . It may be typical to them , but not to guests . Never again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our daughter got married December 24th at the Swiss ##ote ##l . From the months of planning to the days leading up to the wedding to the day after everything went smoothly . . . . the staff could not have been any friend ##lier or more helpful . The rooms were beautiful and comfortable . the Du ##plex suite was stunning with the almost 360 degree view of the city from 40 floors up . The ballroom ##s were gorgeous for the wedding . Special S ##hout out to Veronica who helped us before the wedding and to Randy who was there day of and day after to help us with everything from getting extra mirrors in our room for hair and makeup to finding shoes that were left in the ballroom . I would highly recommend the Swiss ##ote ##l for weddings - and as a great place to stay in downtown Chicago ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly Staff ! Great atmosphere ! Great drinks and snack ##s in the bar ! Excellent breakfast and lunch in the restaurant ! Close to downtown shopping and the Gold Coast ! We visit regularly and love the recent updates to the room and bar ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] El ##eva ##tor down had to use the stairs or wait 10 to 15 minutes for the elevator . El ##eva ##tor should have been repaired AS ##AP but no one seemed concerned ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Con ##cer ##ir was more interested in phone than what was going on around him . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located in the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile just off Michigan Ave , this hotel afford ##s you easy access to the area ' s shops , restaurants , bars , and the Northwestern Memorial Medical Campus . It ' s extremely quiet ( it ' s on Walton , not Michigan ) , clean , and comfortable . We were met by friendly staff and made to feel at home . W ##if ##i is free to those staying at the hotel . They even upgraded the TV network to HD the morning we stayed . One cave ##at - the real reason Chicago is called the Wind ##y City is because of politics , but you wouldn ' t know it if you step around the corner at Walton and Michigan - hold on to your hat ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I picked this hotel as a weekend get ##away for my girlfriend and I , and it was wonderful ! The front desk lady Kay ( nice on the eyes by the way ) was very professional . The service was top notch , from check in to check out , I cannot express what this weekend meant to us . We felt like royalty ! The hotel was beautiful , the room was gorgeous and clean and the service was excellent . We were just amazed at how wonderful Kay was , and the rest of the staff , but Kay stood out the bra ##ids - maid that ' s looking better than the bride ! St ##at ##ues ##que . I have absolutely fallen in love with this hotel and yes , yes , yes , yes , we will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Intercontinental Ma ##g Mile had such a great location for our Birthday Weekend in downtown Chicago . It was perfectly located between the top of the Hancock for our B - day drink and Millennium Park . When it rain ##ed on Saturday we could enjoy the grand ##est indoor pool in the entire city . We ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great happy hour and bartender Josh was the highlight ! The employees in the lobby are S ##O N ##IC ##E and helpful too . Ki ##nz ##ie isn ' t fancy but it ' s affordable and well located and I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has so much to offer . I ’ ve stayed there many times . It is just a short walk to all that Michigan Avenue has to offer . The restaurant and bar are top - notch . The beds are like sleeping on a cloud ! But what makes this hotel stand out are the people who work there . They are incredibly sensitive and consider ##ate to the needs of their guests . I heart ##ily recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent service . Great staff . Very clean rooms . Fast check in . Jose , the manager , is great ! ! the hotel is very well located . Great value ! In general , I would recommend this hotel to stay in the Chicago business district , close to the best restaurants and shops . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here during our first trip to Chicago . We were welcomed and accommodate ##d very well for all requests asked . It is in a good spot for travelers to enjoy the city as we were able to walk to a lot of must see destinations . Service was top notch . Room ##s were average but clean and comfortable . Only not so great comment is the rooms were small and the king bed was also on the smaller side . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was a great find . The location was great , we could walk to get pizza , worlds largest Star ##bu ##cks , and the bean . Martin ##i bar was great . The elevator is very slow , but it worked . The bed was comfortable and did not have bugs . I looked ! The shower was great . We are very pleased with everything about this hotel . We spent most of our time exploring not hanging out in the hotel , so it was great . Self parking was $ 48 and about two blocks away . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an exceptional and outstanding property . A unique experience . All aspects of the stay exceeded our expectations . It ' s right in the heart of the theater district , near an L station , and only a few blocks from the beach . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was absolutely shocked by the condition of our room . For over $ 500 per night plus $ 72 per day for parking , you would think the place would be more up to date . The restaurant food was me ##dio ##cre , at best . The pictures speak for themselves . At ##ten ##tion to detail is not a strong suit for them . They need help with how to clean properly , for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel experience . Multiple rooms for family wedding . All nicely appointed and spacious . Te ##rri ##fic staff in reception , the lounge " Bar " and restaurant " Columbus Ta ##p . " A few rooms not ready when requested , but many a ##pologies and compliment ##ary drink for the delay . Lo ##bby restaurant reasonably priced for lunch and dinner . Did not take advantage of Fair ##mont Gold offer - $ 55 per day per room , that in re ##tro ##spect was very good value . A ##ppe ##ti ##zers / small plates in the Bar were very good and good value . Easy two block walk to Millennium Park and The River ##walk , about 15 minute walk to Navy Pier . Great location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were surprised to discover the Conrad had moved . I really loved the old space . But the new property is te ##rri ##fic , and the room is one of the best I ' ve stayed in as far as contemporary amenities . We were not disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot is a great hidden g ##em in the big city . The rooms are clean and fresh . Not overly large , but big enough for a stay away from home . The bed ##ding was com ##fy and just the way I like it . The staff was very nice and helpful . It was a nice place to stay right in the middle of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . I will stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A soon as stepped into the hotel I was amazed loved it the bell boy welcomed you in took your suitcase ##s to the reception lovely Room was adequate for two of us but the view out of the window was nothing to write home about another building and air conditioning units but love the atmosphere of the hotel The only downfall was the pillows soon as you put your head on them they were useless But loved the rainfall shower what an experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is so friendly and welcoming , the room was very comfortable ( th ##o draft ##y in the bitter ##est cold ) . One of the elevators seems to be out of service for the next few weeks ( Feb 2019 ) , so that adds a delay in getting in and out of the building . The restaurant has good food and is very com ##fy ; great atmosphere . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el Hotel was beyond magnificent ! Love ##d the atmosphere ; the con ##cier ##ge service ; the clean ##liness and friend ##liness ! The bar was awesome ! The restaurant had great service and a wonderful breakfast with the B ##ES ##T past ##ries ! ! ! Our stay was very memorable ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights . It was an exceptional room and the service from the door staff and check - in staff was superb . The v ##alet parking lot is a couple of blocks away , so it takes 10 - 15 ##min to retrieve a car minimum . If someone is ahead of you it can be 20 - 30 , so just plan ahead when you call for your car . Breakfast items are over ##p ##rice ##d , but I guess that is Chicago . If you don ' t need to eat multiple plates of food , I would go to the Star ##bu ##cks R ##oast ##ery on the corner instead . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved this hotel . . . . great location , nice room , comfortable bed with tons of pillows . Great wine hour with super friendly staff . Only downfall was we were part of a time share presentation at W ##yn ##dham around the corner . . . that was quite unpleasant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was great and gold floor with lounge was exceptional especially with the service of people like Man ##dan ##a . Room was nice , clean , and would only do if there was a discount on the room or high price doesn ' t matter . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Had been some time since staying at this hotel , but it was great to return now that it is Public Chicago ( we always love the Ambassador East ) . It is in fact the best location in the city - - not too chaotic but accessible to so many things - - still with the heart of a great neighborhood . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bed ##s were comfortable . Show ##er had amazing water pressure . The tub was a bit high without hand rails . For older patrons it might be difficult to get in the shower . Some common areas ( elevators ) could use some T ##LC . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco is a wonderful ##ly located hotel . Really close to the theater district and train station . Our room was on the corner and it was huge ! Two big window seats to relax in . Very nice staff . Close to both Du ##nk ##in Don ##uts and Star ##bu ##cks . A nice walk ##able distance to Michigan Ave at a very reasonable price . The de ##cor is very nice and the hotel was super clean . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the pleasure of staying at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago for my latest business trip . The room was extremely comfortable and clean . The staff was great , everything from front desk to all of the room assistance staff ( room service & cleaning . ) I like the added convenience of sending text messages to receive additional items to the room ( coffee , cream ##er , etc . ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose this hotel for two reasons : a previously good experience and a L ##yric Opera rate . The room and hotel are decorated nicely . The staff was friendly . H ##OW ##E ##VE ##R , there were doors banging and loud re ##vel ##ors between 12 : 30 and 3 : 00 a . m . Sleep was all ##usive . Then , the noise started about 9 : 00 a . m . again . I suggest the hotel create some quiet floors for folks who actually want to sleep , or con ##verse ##ly , floors only for those who wish to enjoy Chicago ' s night ##life ! Also , charge for internet in the room ! Really ? ? I doubt we will stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , friendly , helpful staff , best view we have ever had in a Chicago hotel . I t was definitely worth the extra money for a corner room , on a high floor . Love ##d all the windows , room was very large . We good see both ways of the Chicago River , and we also had a view of Lake Michigan , and the f ##er ##ris wheel at Navy pier ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago is a great hotel , with amazing staff willing to help at every turn . The room was well appointed with wonderful amenities . The text feature with the hotel was a great plus , super fast response time and follow up from them to be sure my needs were met . The location can ' t be beat . We will be back ! Great job by the entire team at the Conrad Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is literally just a few feet from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile on Michigan Avenue . The shopping is excellent and the views are reward ##ing . The staff was first - rate . Everyone I encountered who worked there was pleasant and was interested in making my experience the best they could . This is a luxurious hotel and sometimes you will find " s ##nob ##by " workers ; not here . They are ho ##sp ##ita ##ble and welcoming . My stay was superb . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Since I last stayed here 2 years ago , the entire hotel has been taste ##fully re ##mo ##del ##ed and is now my favorite Kim ##pton property in Chicago . Wonderful staff , very spacious , clean and comfortable rooms ( although small bathroom ##s ) and a te ##rri ##fic location in the heart of the theater district . Stay ##ed in a suite with a nice view of the city . We had a great stay and definitely plan to come again . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall the Swiss ##ote ##l was an excellent value for a business trip . The room was clean and well furnished . Michigan Avenue was nearby . The morning breakfast k ##ios ##k was efficient and the food was good . The Palm restaurant was very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great hotel - we had a beautiful view from our room . We were able to walk to the wedding and enjoy the city of Chicago . Just steps from Michigan a ##ve and all the shopping . The lake view is amazing [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hilton Honor doesn ' t go as far as It did last year . Was really disappointed to discover that this location closed its Executive Lounge ( after booking ) - - they ' re offering a modest $ 10 credit for any food purchased on ##site . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Complete ##ly disappointed in the clean ##liness of the beds . Stay ##ed in a double room . I pulled the sheets back on one bed and there was food all over the du ##vet . I pulled the sheets back on the second and there were c ##rum ##bs between the sheets . House ##keeping stated that it happens when they switch out a room but the old customer is still in there . ( Why would they not wait until the person had checked out ? ) No a ##pologies . Then tried to just switch out the bottom sheets and nothing else . Said they don ’ t normally switch the du ##vet cover between customers . There was food on it . I ’ m completely grossed out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They run Earth ##day program , sounds very cute but the staff lacks training and information about how it actually works . I signed up for the program and they wouldn ' t let me use the credit that I had accumulated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at the So ##fit ##el many times and would say generally a really great hotel . Excellent service etc . Typically I stay in a suite mostly because my wife loves the Her ##mes amenities . ( I do too ) . This time booked a regular room for a one night " stay ##cation " . The bed was un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly uncomfortable . Not sure what the story was with that ? Everything else was great but honestly the bed in my standard room was terrible . Service and staff were great as expected . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our company chose this hotel for our stay during I ##HA . This was a change from our typical location and it was so ##oo the right move . The beds are amazing ##ly comfortable and the staff is top notch . Don ' t forget to visit the bar in the evening for a relaxing drink . great view and G ##RE ##AT bartender ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room , location great . Staff really helpful , friendly professional . Service , am ##bie ##nce , quality of food and drink in bar / restaurant area all great . When return to Chicago , would be delighted to stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great stay I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the Chicago area . Everything from the room to the environment was spectacular . I really feel that the staff did a great job meeting the needs of their customers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super location for shopping or touring Chicago . Hotel was surprisingly quiet and is pet friendly . In serious need of an update but we understand that is in progress . Our carpet was badly stained and smelled with a view of the dump ##ster . However the room has a com ##fy bed and was as clean as it could be . Staff friendly and helpful . Restaurant closed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here on December 22nd and had the best stay . The staff was friendly and court ##eous . The had the co ##zie ##st lounge that offered free app ##eti ##zers from 5 - 8 ; they were delicious . The rooms were so clean and comfortable . The location could NO ##T B ##E B ##ET ##TE ##R . I will never stay anywhere else that ' s for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was happy with the whole experience except the clean ##liness . There were many things on the carpet that wasn ' t clean and blood / k ##et ##chu ##p ? on the night stand . Makes me wonder how well they cleaned everything else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel seems pretty recently renovated and they did a nice job . Our room had an awesome view and a nice window seat to enjoy it . The staff was really friendly and helpful . It is also in a great location for any sights ##ee ##ing in the Loop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in is on the 20th floor for those that haven ' t been here before . Check - in was fast for us and we were off to the room . Our room was situated just off the elevators on the 14th floor . One thing we noticed that was a negative was the sounds in the hotel , we could hear the people around us in their rooms and the elevators all through the night . But the service was amazing , room was very modern . The switches in the rooms are something that could have been left out , but not a big deal . They are touch and hard to read the words on them , pretty small . W ##if ##i included . We will be staying here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This g ##em of a hotel was fantastic from start to finish ! Most of the city ’ s popular attractions are within walking distance and the trains are around the corner if you need to head out of the loop . The Blue line takes you from the hotel directly to O ’ Hare in about 40 min ##s . The hotel interior is beautiful , clean and ch ##ic . Think “ The Great G ##ats ##by ” meets Art Dec ##o . Check in was a breeze thanks to KC at the front desk , and the room was incredibly spacious with a great view of the city . Overall , I highly recommend for couples or even solo travelers like myself ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The suites at the Palmer House in Chicago are amazing ! Very spacious and comfortable . Large enough for a small private meeting or gathering . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I will definitely return to this location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome hotel ! Marvin the door ##man was friendly and entertaining ! All the staff was friendly and court ##eous . Bed ##s slept great and room was clean . Lady at check in and Paige J check out were so sweet ! A + [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was in a great location . The breakfast b ##uff ##et was good but a little price ##y at $ 24 . 50 . The con ##cier ##ge was rude , because i was waiting to ask him a question for 15 min ##s on the shuttle and he would not acknowledge me at all . Everything else was good . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I always love staying at the So ##fit ##el ! The staff is welcoming , friendly , knowledge ##able , and helpful . The amenities are great . And the Chicago location is perfect - plenty of nearby dining and shopping . The rooms are so co ##zy and com ##fy . I try and stay here every trip , whether for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The stay was awesome , and the service great . Bath ##rooms are small . I was charged twice for my room , and have had a hard time getting my money back . A week and a half later , I am still trying to re ##co ##up my money . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Home ##wood Suite ##s - Chicago Downtown at 40 E Grand was our base for a so ##ro ##rity 30 year reunion . The staff was helpful , quick to serve and friendly . Our room rate was incredible given the location and per ##ks . Plus we had access to several areas for our group to gather and enjoy each others company without inter ##up ##ting other visitors pleasant stay . It was a perfect fit for our needs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Worst front desk experience ever . Con ##tin ##ually argued every request I made . Couldn ’ t even run my credit card correctly . Then tried to double charge both my cards . Even as a rewards guest wouldn ’ t give me an extra 30 min ##s for late check ##out . Will never stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our recent stay at the Hotel Monaco was a pleasant surprise . I booked a weekend for shopping and entertainment when I found it on a list of top bout ##ique hotels in Chicago . Somehow those " lists " don ' t always meet my expectations . However , the Monaco did live up to its ranking with a comfortable sized room , adorable window boxes with views of the river , updated de ##cor that was very taste ##ful and the hotel was clean . Plus , the free wine hour each night watching the pets troll ##ing in - and - out is a nice way to start out your evening . Will stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , beautiful hotel . Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful . The room was large and clean . Check in and out was a breeze . The location of the hotel is excellent , close to shops , restaurants , park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a week ( 02 - 08 Feb ) for business . The location is excellent , across from a beautiful park and within walking distance to good shops and restaurants . Additionally , the Irish pub inside of the hotel was great for late night drinks . The staff was very kind . My only complaint is that the fitness center was not included in the stay - seems very odd and penny pinch ##ing to me . For that reason , I will not be booking future business stays here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel has excellent location . Staff is very customer focused . Extreme ##ly busy over the Christmas holiday week , but food was well stock ##ed for evening happy hour and breakfast . Nice indoor pool and exercise area . Only negative is that parking is v ##alet and somewhat expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We hosted about 25 rooms for our NY ##E wedding this past week and working with the whole All ##egro team was S ##O easy . Zero complaints . Leading up to the event they were always a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , helpful , and re ##sp ##ons ##ive . We needed a few things while we were staying there at the last minute and everyone was so easy to work with and helped make our experience great . The amenities are amazing , the area is great , and that lobby cannot be beat . It ' s always clean , comfortable , and affordable . My absolute favorite . Who doesn ' t love a free prose ##cco happy hour ! ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay at this hotel ! You can ' t beat the location and value with the compliment ##ary breakfast and social hour . Our room was spot ##less and all the amenities of home . Will definitely be back ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was the first time we visited Chicago and we know and trust Hilton suites when we are new to a place . The hotel t ##icked all the boxes , had spacious rooms with a decent size kitchen / utilities so we did a fair bit of shopping at the local Jewel O ##sco ( my daughter loved the little shop ##per trolley ##s , why doesn ##t everyone do them ) . Room ##s were fitted out to a high standard and i suspect the carpet ##s were brand new due to the amount of static shock ##s we were getting every ##time we touched each other or door handles - z ##ap . Breakfast was one of the best i ##ve had in a long time , the choice and quality superb . As others have mentioned location was great and we managed to fit in a visit to Billy Goa ##t Tavern which was just up the road ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived late morning for a single night stay and were pleasant ##ly surprised to be given access to our room right away . It was a beautiful room with plenty of space for two adults and two teens . The teens especially liked that there were plenty of mirrors and adjust ##able lighting ( everyone had their own spot to do makeup ) . The staff was very friendly and helpful . We were in and out several times during the day , and were welcomed back every time . The location is perfect for Ma ##g Mile shopping and many restaurants are within a short walk . This will be our " go to " hotel when we overnight in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The best dog friendly hotel in the city . Perfect location no matter what you want to do downtown . Nice rooms and services , have always been treated with care . Everything was very clean and fresh . Above and beyond co ##vid - 19 regulations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A nice hotel but not spectacular . Good service with upgraded room at check - in . Room was tired but spacious . No room service which I guess we should have checked on before ##hand . Show ##er was spacious but layout was weird with large sunk ##en tub inside shower . Overall it is a 3 - 4 star hotel with a great location right off Michigan Ave and very near the Lake . Would probably try something else in the same area next time but would not rule out going back . Very nice lobby bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice , comfortable and s ##ty ##lish hotel . The staff is welcoming , quick to help and always smiling . My room was simply imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , top notch furnishings , superb bed ( I literally want to buy one , with all the bed ##ding , for my home ) and a fast free internet . Food served in the restaurant downstairs and the room service items are all delicious . Location is also un ##beat ##able , right off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Overall , one of my top choices in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is very well located and very near the Miracle Mile . Our room was very clean and had recently been refurbished . All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful . Staff on the con ##cier ##ge desk were very knowledge ##able . The breakfast b ##uff ##et was reasonably priced and offered a good selection . No w ##if ##i in room but available in the Lo ##bby area . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nicole Thompson , Craig Murray and the rest of the staff there do an incredible job making their guest feel both welcomed and relaxed . Such a great job at hospitality that I decided to join their Le Co ##rr rewards program . I look forward to experiencing their property in the near future ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was good , I would definitely recommend it . Good room quality , nice staff , great pool with really warm water . Breakfast and evening social were great , the food was ta ##sty . The only annoying thing is the mandatory 200 characters review obligation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Un ##com ##fort ##able bed . Bath ##room could be cleaner . Guest room smelled of cigarettes . Wouldn ' t recommend unless these things are resolved . Wanted to love this place as it was quite affordable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked the Alison Victoria Ser ##eni ##ty Suite for our wedding weekend . The suite was ST ##UN ##NI ##NG and the views spectacular . Kim ##pton ’ s service was perfect : brought us extra chairs , champagne flute ##s , plates , and compliment ##ary champagne . We live in Chicago , but we loved the suite so much that we plan to come back for a stay - cat ##ion . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our trip to Chicago was to celebrate the holidays and see our son sing in the Christmas concert at Loyola . We had a lovely stay at your hotel , we love the smaller size of your hotel and the personal attention from staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel couldn ' t be better if you are interested in staying in the Loop . It ' s near the el , walking distance to many theaters , opera , shopping and the lake ##front . They offer a Pro ##se ##cco hour between 5 and 6 pm , which is very nice . I found the room small , but comfortable , well - appointed . My only complaint is that the walls were thin , and so the noisy group in the next room was annoying ( it was pro ##m night ) . Otherwise , it was a nice place to stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I just checked into the Hilton Chicago and I have to say , from the moment I walked it I was struck with how beautiful the building and interior are here . It feels very re ##gal . I arrived early - around 11 : 30 am ( check in is at 3 ##pm ) , but Cars ##arra was so helpful in getting me into my room early and setup with w ##if ##i , etc . Very pleased with the room and the $ is right ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Monaco is in a great location - right on the river , within easy walking distance of Mill ##eni ##um Park and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , from the moment we pulled up to the curb , to check - in , to room service . We were upgraded to a del ##uxe river view room on the 10th floor . En ##tering the spacious room , we found a free bottle of champagne and a plate of mac ##aro ##ns . How lovely ! There was a huge window with a great view . The bed was very comfortable , the decoration taste ##ful . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel several times and it is for good reason . The hospitality of the staff is always amazing . The room upgrades are great . My recommendation is any suite face Lake Michigan . The rooms are extremely spacious and the greatest thing is the view of the lake on a sunny morning . The down ##side is that it isn ’ t walking distance to a lot of restaurants or shops but it is across from the park . As always parking is quite expensive but well worth the extra expense . There is a great fitness center with an indoor track and a nice size pool . As a Hilton Honors member I am able to get a great rate for the level of service and luxury of this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##ruly a great , smaller hotel with friendly service and modern amenities . The rooms have tall ceiling and nice window ledge seating which overall makes it feel very large and inviting . The beds , pillows , and sheets are all com ##fy . I appreciated the addition of the Ch ##rome ##cast on the TV and the Blu ##tooth speaker . Those modern touches are something I have never experienced in a hotel before . My only complaint is there is very little room in the fridge with all the alcohol added for consumption ( at additional fees , of course ) . I do not drink so that was kind of annoying when I ' d rather be putting in my own drinks and left - overs and it was very hard to do so . Other than that is was an overall great stay at the Kim ##pton Monaco and I ' d love to return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This review is specifically for the café in the hotel . I came here for a conference and that means that the line for coffee and to - go breakfast was always long , but not to worry ! The wonderful ladies working at the café are a well oil ##ed machine that give great service with a positive attitude and a smile . They made my long days in the exhibit ##ior hall start in a bright note ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our one bedroom suite with se ##per ##ate bedroom and living area was excellent . Spa ##cious , modern , bright and cheerful with a beautiful wall of windows . Good thing there are electric roll down blind ##s ! Location is excellent . Walk ##ed everywhere . Staff were always willing to help and answer our many questions with a smile . The breakfast was ordinary . All in all , however , I would go back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is really good . My room was clean and spacious and There was any comfort I needed in . The staff is lovely and the location is central , very close to North Michigan street . If you are in the city for business this hotel will be a great choice [SEP]
0	[CLS] I live in the neighborhood and had to stay overnight at a hotel and picked the Ambassador Chicago , since I walk past it almost every day . It ' s such a beautiful bout ##ique hotel in the Gold Coast of Chicago with so much history , that I thought it would be great to stay there . The entire staff , especially V ##idal Moran , the Director in the front office , were so wonderful . They even had a special welcome bag for my little dog ##gy Juliette including treats and a fold ##able bowl . So adorable ! The guest room I stayed in with a King bed ( that was so comfortable ) was huge ! If you haven ' t seen the hotel take a walk through it . It ' s f ##abulous ! I loved it and I highly recommend this to anyone traveling or just wants to stop in for a drink or dinner ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , beautiful hotel , phenomena ##l staff . We felt like rock stars every day . The restaurant was amazing and comfortable . Walking distance to everything . Just a block away from the L station , no car needed . Safe neighborhood . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I usually try to stay here when in Chicago ( fourth or fifth stay ) ! Just love the proximity to Millennium Park and the river make this a perfect spot to stay . This go around , I had the chance to enjoy the Gold Club Lounge which is a te ##rri ##fic touch to the stay and take in the spa . A very special shout out to Man ##dan ##a - she was so very at ##ten ##tive , court ##eous and friendly ! One day , I wasn ' t feeling too well , and she really went out of her way to make sure a had a lovely cup of tea with honey . Just really appreciated her care and te ##rri ##fic smile ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ing at the hotel near McCormick Place is ##olate ##s you from downtown restaurants and attractions . This property is convenient ##ly located to Grant Park , Navy Pier , architectural tours and many restaurants . Room ##s are good , fitness center was good and the view from the club lounge is te ##rri ##fic ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Fair ##mont for two nights . Check - in was easy and we were allowed to check in early . We had booked a Fair ##mont Gold room and were on the 15th floor with a nice view . The bathroom was large and updated and extra towels and pillows were delivered as requested within minutes of getting to the room . The condition of the room was fair at best . The carpet was s ##na ##gged , pulling up in places , out ##dated and stained . The vinyl on the chairs and bed was cracked and p ##eel ##ing . The de ##cor definitely needed to be updated . The entire staff was top - notch . A special thank you to Man ##dan ##a for making our trips to the Fair ##mont Gold Lounge friendly , welcoming and so pleasant . It was a very expensive stay and I wonder if some rooms are updated and others are not . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ##t make same mistake I did . . never book this place It was horrible Couldn ##t wait to check out It was like jungle Nobody had clue what ##s going on No help Nothing organized U have to do everything by u ##r self [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wife and I stayed here for 1 night last Saturday . The staff treated us just fantastic and set us up in a great room with a nice view of the Hancock building . The rooms are decorated very nicely and everything is definitely finished in an ups ##cale fashion . El ##eva ##tors always seem to be quick too . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful in recommend ##ing a great little coffee shop just down the block . Probably one of the nice ##st hotels I ’ ve ever stayed in and the bed was very comfortable ! Always a good time in Chicago ! Thank you . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you can afford it this is a fantastic place to be your home base while visiting the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . For us it was a one - time one night s ##p ##lu ##rge because we had business at the German Consul ##ate which is located in the same building . Everyone we came in contact with treated us like royalty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel arguably has the best home base location while exploring this amazing city . Walk ##able from the Blue Line and right off the Mile , the Ki ##nz ##ie acts like a perfect landing spot no matter how short or long your stay is here . Breakfast served on each floor every morning . Dr ##ink token ##s for the sixth floor bar . A very comfortable bed . Close to everything that you have marked in your guide ##book and some other hidden g ##ems . Friendly staff from check in to check out . My second stay and I hope to be back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent service and the room was clean and very nice . They made sure our stay was comfortable and we where happy . I will recommend to friends and family . Great place ! We will come back again soon , hopefully for the holiday . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel Monaco is a nice downtown hotel that is close to the metro and bus lines and our room had a te ##rri ##fic river view . The plus side is location , view , clean ##liness and de ##cor . The negative side is the fact that our next door neighbor had a very ya ##ppy dog and the fact that our room keys needed to be re ##made everyday as they both failed to work every day we stayed there . So every day we came back to our room , neither of our keys worked and we had to t ##rai ##pse back down to the desk to get new keys . And we kept the keys away from our cell phones etc . After three days in a room , it became a bit annoying . The breakfast is worth buying and they offer a wonderful g ##lut ##en free menu . The breakfast price is reasonable as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hu ##bby and I needed to get away from the busy ##ness of the holidays . The Intercontinental was the perfect place ! The friend ##liness and helpful ##ness of every staff member we encountered made our visit extremely rest ##ful . We hope to be able to visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 4 nights as I was running in the Chicago Marathon , great hotel just off the ' main ' road in Chicago . The hotel had everything we needed and the swimming pool on the 5th floor was great after days of walking around ! I would recommend asking for a high room ( we were on 25th ) and the views of Hancock Tower were stunning . We didn ' t eat in the hotel but had a few drinks and the food did look really good . A great hotel and would def ##iant ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel . The double bed suite on the 36th floor was amazing . The room was very clean and the windows offered great views of the city . Love ##d that it had two bathroom ##s . One had a walk - in shower , and the other had a large oval tub . Room service was quick and the setup of our food and con ##di ##ments were nice . For parking , we used spot hero at a nearby garage . Will definitely stay here again for special occasions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . You can walk anywhere . Close to the river walk and great restaurants . Room ##s are super clean and s ##ty ##lish . I would definitely stay here again You can Kay ##sk or bike around the river Bring your walking shoes [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 2 days with a family , 2nd time in one year . You get same good Triple A service . From the moment we check ##w ##d in , all staff has shown extra effort , Con ##cier ##ge has spent a lot of time to fix our train to get to our next destinations and good restaurants to make our trip un ##fo ##rge ##table , if we come again this is our h ##ı ##me to stay on our next trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gorge ##ous , historic building - absolutely fantastic lobby for hanging out , having a drink etc . Small room but quite nice and comfortable bed . Te ##rri ##fic gym . Very close to Art Institute and the Architecture Foundation tour departure - and multiple train lines . This was the hotel for a family wedding party . Would stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had my wedding at this venue , it was amazing ! The hotel staff , specifically Paige L . went above and beyond for my day ! It was absolutely beautiful and more than I could have imagined ! Guest ##s say it was the best wedding they have attended yet ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just wanted to really give a warm acknowledge ##ment to the staff at the 15th floor lounge . . . especially Man ##dan ##a . She was very sweet and disc ##ern ##ing as to what I wanted served . Her presence in the morning was very welcoming . She ' s definitely a keeper and represents all things Fair ##mont [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] This elegant , historic bout ##ique hotel in a beautiful neighborhood in Chicago was just wonderful in every respect . Our group booked five rooms for a business trip and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their stay . Our rooms were clean and com ##fy . The lobby , restaurant and library bar with a fireplace were warm and welcoming . And the staff couldn ' t have been more helpful . Some stand ##outs include Kenny , front desk clerk who checked us in . He gave us the fascinating history of the place ; El ##vir ##a S ##ko ##mor ##ows ##ka & Maya Dyke ##ma gave us all the support and help we needed to make our business trip a complete success . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] W ##i ##F ##i should be in price . I hire a room and when I arrived they told me there is not w ##if ##i cause that was a special offer . The same is with hotel shuttle , on the booking . com they show that is a shuttle from O ` Hare Airport but hotel has no own shuttle . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a hidden g ##em in Chicago . We are in Chicago about 3 - 4 times a year and wouldn ' t think of staying anywhere else . We were in Chicago in June for our son ' s wedding , where we hosted all our guests . D ##wayne made sure all of them were taken care of upon their arrival . The entire staff at the Talbot ##t always goes above and beyond to make our stay here perfect . We look forward to staying at the Talbot ##t every time we visit Chicago , where it ' s almost become our second home . Grace & Jack [SEP]
0	[CLS] I will recommend this place to anyone and everyone . When I return to Chicago I will definitely stay at the O ##m ##ni . The location was great . Walking distance from E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING . Check ##ing in and out was made easy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 4 days with 2 friends to shop and sights ##ee in June . This was the best place in all aspects . We had a suite with 2 rooms and 3 beds . We loved it ! They email ##ed me before my visit asking how they could help me . I wrote back that my flight arrived early in the day and I ’ d love to check in early . My room was ready and really made my visit perfect . When my flight home was delayed , the front - desk staff encouraged me to use the lobby and pool and make myself at home . I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to all my friends . Each and every hotel employee made me feel welcome and special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel . Great location on the loop . Just watch that payments aren ’ t taken off the card you submit at reception when you book in . They can take a while to come back . Room ##s a bit small too . Room ##s very clean and staff all really professional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In a residential area but close to everything - the Lake - restaurants and shops - great walking area and top restaurant in the hotel with in ##vent ##ive menu and a great bar to meet and greet new and old friends [SEP]
1	[CLS] Combined business with family visit . We shop ##ped and visited Loyola university We walked shop ##ped and enjoyed great restaurants . We were disappointed that some of our favorite stores have left much ##igan an ##en ##ue . Chicago needs to bring stores like Potter ##y Bar ##n , C ##rate and Barr ##el and N ##eim ##an last call back to keep this area a prime shopping source . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our stay at this hotel really helped make our trip ! We loved our room and the hotel in general . I would stay at this hotel again any time ! Wish we could have stayed longer ! Great location as well , close to everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in a great location for walking towards the Willis Tower and about a mile from the shopping area . Each room was equipped with a yoga mat , robe , and umbrella . Over priced snack ##s & drinks were available . The hotel cater ##ed our meals and the staff was superb and the meals were excellent . Check in / out was quick . The hotel offered multi sitting areas & excellent w ##if ##i in a modern environment that sport ##ed an art Dec ##o feel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wow I thought I was in the dead zone of Michigan Ave when I pulled up I was like w ##ow this is really nice the door people were friendly and polite and helpful and couldn ' t be more helpful the front desk associates were helpful and professional the famous ma ##rt ##ini bar was cool even thou the pat ##riot ##s won the game I ' m saving the best for last the young lady who was in charge of the coffee bar was more like the hotel manager she K ##ne ##w everything about the hotel the restaurant and the neighborhood she is an asset much thanks to the millennium kn ##icker ##bo ##cker for a great stay highly recommend five stars [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice place , great location and excellent value . Service was very good for the price , facilities were well maintained and room was beautiful with great view . Location is great for walking Michigan Avenue shopping , right in the thick of it all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location , nice lobby and fun bar . The rooms left a little to be desired and the room hallway ##s a bit s ##hab ##by . However , the beds were comfortable and the water pressure in the shower excellent . The location makes the hotel worth the stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Girls trip with my daughter & adult granddaughter . Con ##ven ##ient to million dollar mile & many more attractions . Co ##m ##fort ##able , great staff , walk way to shopping mall . Absolutely will stay again ! See my travel blog Travel ##over ##50 . info [SEP]
0	[CLS] This superb ##ly located hotel , in the middle of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , is architectural ##ly magnificent with lovely views over the city . The food is good though dining options are limited , not an overwhelming problem because of the superb location . Service is friendly . Fitness center is very well equipped and convenient to use , and the swimming pool is magnificent . There are hotels with more modern amenities in Chicago but few combine the location near to many of the city ' s attractions with the physical beauty of the building . The only reason I with ##held a fifth star is that the room furnishings can be a bit s ##hab ##by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fine location in the heart of the city at Ki ##nz ##ie and State Streets . Interest ##ing continental breakfast setup on each floor at the elevator lobby . In ##ti ##mate lounge and happy hour each evening . At ##ten ##tive staff that are not over ##be ##aring . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stay at this hotel when we travel to Chicago and are never disappointed . The staff goes above and beyond to make sure everything is taken care of to our satisfaction . If you eat in the Michael Jordan restaurant be sure to try the garlic bread ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a great location for us and the room was clean and quiet . The food from the g ##rille was good . Very easy to get a cab . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful . We only stayed one night but it was very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able living from home with welcoming , at ##ten ##tative , and helpful staff . Nice ##ly sized rooms , breakfast , work ##out space and pool . Only two elevators - - so if you ' re visiting at a busy time there ' s a bit of wait . I find the kitchen table a great place to work before or after meetings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location between the river and the park area . We were here for an exposition at McCormick and found it was only a short walk to Millennium Station . There were nicely appointed clean rooms and the hotel had above average amenities such as lounge area , bar and restaurant . The bed ##ding was good and with decent pillows . I didn ' t have time to check out the gym but heard they were re ##nova ##ting and had passes for a another nearby gym in the neighborhood [SEP]
0	[CLS] A f ##abulous charming hotel is gone ! The new owners have destroyed what was the finest hotel in Chicago ! It is now just a place to stay , like every other hotel in Chicago . V ##ER ##Y disappointing ! ! ! The Talbot is no longer charming . It is just a newly re ##mo ##del ##ed hotel like all the rest . There is no Old World Cha ##rm , no oversized a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s , just a hotel room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended an event in the city over the weekend and this property was the home base . Location was convenient and hotel staff & amenities were great . The arrival experience was quick and easy and I certainly felt welcome by the staff . The room was spacious and had plenty of outlets / USB for personal devices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family had 3 rooms at this hotel June 23 - 25 . We were in town due to a death in the family . David and Erica went out of their way to make this as easy as possible . They put our rooms together and made sure there was a c ##ri ##b in one room . We were given club access as gold members and had a late check out . The customer service here is the kind that should be replica ##ted at all hotels . They value star ##wood preferred guests and did everything possible to help us at this difficult time . The hotel was packed but it was still a great experience . High ##ly recommend the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay was good in general . Location close to John Hancock Observatory . Con ##ven ##ient to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Room was clean and up o date . However , noise from A / C unit is loud . Staff very friendly and helpful . She ##ryl from Guest services very welcoming . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The w ##if ##i doesn ' t work , when you ask reception they say it ' s a network error which has lasted over two days , no water bottles in the room , no room service available , the room has a computer to use to order food in from local places who then refuse to deliver to the hotel due to parking problems , no hot beverages in the lobby , when asked they said they didn ' t have a machine , the staff seem miserable and unwilling to help put , the room it ' s self was fine , but the service was terrible [SEP]
1	[CLS] Security unlawful ##ly To ##wed a Handicap ##ped P ##la ##card vehicle in a spot that is not Hotel property nor was is in a no parking done . S ##po ##ke to Q ##ui ##ance B ##ib ##bs Assistant Front Office manager who agrees it shouldn ' t have been towed and wasn ' t marked no parking including Bernard B ##ila ##l who said I should contest it and it shouldn ' t have been towed who is head Con ##cier ##ge . Left a V ##M with Director John Goodman at 312 ##26 ##8 ##80 ##50 and Director of Operations Chris Smart at 312 - 26 ##8 - 81 ##00 . My family vacation has been thoroughly interrupted including cancel ##ling dinner reservations and significant out of pocket expenses for the tow . The hotel has a chance to make it right but has yet to do so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great trip and stay . Had some drinks at bar a couple nights with great service . I absolutely loved the early online check in . I would definitely come back . Thanks for great service and rooms ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed 3 nights for a conference at this hotel . I had a 25th floor room with club access . Overall my stay was good . Staff was always pleasant and helpful . I liked being able to message them through the Bon ##voy app . Need more coffee packets ? Send a text and it was sent right up . Nice re ##mo ##del ##ed club lounge . Ad ##e ##qua ##te breakfast choices ; eggs , o ##at ##me ##al , you ##gu ##rt , bag ##els , etc . The room was very quiet and I slept great . That ’ s most important . Room ##s , especially , bathroom ##s are a little out ##dated . Some should come around and fix the little things ; s ##c ##ruff marks on walls , chip marks in wall ##paper , dark g ##rout , etc . these are minor things . I would definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this property for 4 nights . A very good location , 5 min ##s walking distance to the Millennium park . Lots of fast food restaurants and shopping store in the vicinity too . The room is clean with all the basic ne ##cess ##ities except for coffee ##maker ( available on request ) but the sound ##proof ##ing need to be work on as i can hear someone talking or flush ##ing the toilet from the next door . The staff from check in , security , chamber ##ma ##ids are all very very friendly and polite . Will be back again whenever i visiting Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is wonderful ! Very clean , lots of staff , several on - site dining options , and close to the heart of downtown Chicago . Would love to have an empty mini fridge included as opposed to the stock ##ed mini bar fridge . Fe ##lt completely safe at all times of the day and night . Only disappointed that continental breakfast wasn ' t an option . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was during a Chicago historic event : Polar V ##ortex of January 2019 . The hotel provided great support and comfort for their guests during this time . All staff were most helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Will be staying at the hotel again in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first time visiting Chicago and the Talbot ##t Hotel was truth ##fully one of the best parts of our trip ! The hotel was very clean , ch ##ic , and the staff was very at ##ten ##tive and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They have a nice bar / restaurant , with excellent drink options and delicious food . Our flight ended up being cancelled and we were able to extend our stay without any has ##sle or penalties . We can ' t wait to come back come spring / summer time , to stay here and take in more wonderful sights of Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First off , The Talbot ##t Hotel was a quality , relaxing and stress - free experience . It was first - time actually being in Chicago as I came for business , but end up staying for two weeks . It was my second time staying in your hotel over the course of my visit . Second , Mr . Chris & the rest of the staff made things very easy , care - free and helpful . I truly appreciate all , and upon visiting Chicago again , The Talbot ##t Hotel will definitely be my hotel of choice . My rating ( 5 ) Stars : [UNK] With Kind Reg ##ards , Te ##rri ##ll Fun ##chess [SEP]
1	[CLS] The team at the H ##ya ##tt will take care of all of your needs the rooms and the quality of service there is outstanding I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a downtown guest experience that is above and beyond . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our experience far exceeded any possible expectations we had . This hotel was beyond amazing at every turn and took our romantic get ##away to the next level . Our room had a door ##bell ! From their delicious happy hour to the incredible breakfast to their stunning service , it had it all . The room made us feel like a million ##aire . . . the staff made us feel like a celebrity . The Conrad has set a new bar for hotels for us . We will never be the same . We would give them 10 stars if we could ! You will not regret your stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff . Close to great restaurants and shopping . Excellent service from Bell ##men including restaurant recommendations . Average sized room but clean and nice bathroom . Wish there were black ##out curtains . Would definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here recently . Good location , but hotel is set in 1930 ' s d ##é ##cor so quite dark . Fe ##lt sometimes as if we were in a film set ! ! Love ##ly idea to have free hot drinks early morning and fruit too . At 5 ##pm free Pro ##se ##cco was served which was lovely . Clean rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is friendly and get through the check in process quickly . The rooms are fantastic . Beautiful , spacious and modern with huge windows . Park ##ing with the hotel is a ridiculous $ 71 a night , so unless you ' re keen on having your car super close , park around the corner . Close to just about everything you ' d want in a Chicago trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful room was nicely appointed and had a large TV . Very quiet . Bath ##room was lovely with double sinks . The bed was very comfortable . Enough closet space . Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tor is in a " drawer " which is neat , but it didn ' t keep anything very cold . Staff was friendly . Problem checking in with credit card machine which didn ' t work . Have eaten at the restaurant before ( not this visit ) and it ' s " ok " but over ##p ##rice ##d for what you get . If you get a good rate here , this is an outstanding hotel choice . Hotel parking is a rip - off . . . we parked a block away for half the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the most welcoming and comfortable hotel in Chicago . It stands out even in comparison to other So ##fit ##els elsewhere . Location , food , bar , check in , con ##cier ##ge all very professional and very customer oriented . Warm but not in ##tr ##usive approach . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was checking in late in the evening coming into Chicago on the red eye . I had the best and quick ##est service . This is my favorite hotel in Chicago . I will be staying here again . The views are always great . Even during the pool & gym renovations the gym on lakes ##hore is a cool gym [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family came from around the country for a wedding . We loved our stay at the Talbot ##t . We would definitely stay here again . D ##wayne was very helpful and a really nice person . It was in a perfect location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great downtown bout ##ique hotel . Clean , very comfortable , and well - designed room with very court ##eous staff . En ##joy ##ed the very ta ##sty compliment ##ary app ##eti ##zers and drinks in the evening and compliment ##ary breakfast that included cereal , bag ##els , don ##uts , m ##uff ##ins , juice and coffee . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Located on E . W ##ack ##er near the Chicago River , this is an ups ##cale contemporary hotel with luxury amenities . Room was spacious , comfortable and updated . It ' s probable that to find a place to eat , transportation is needed , as there didn ' t seem to be too many restaurants within walking distance . But , all in all , a great stay and the staff was polite and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My company and I stayed here for a business conference and leading up to the conference we had made some plans with the hotel staff to host an event for our customers . David Tin ##sley who is the food and beverage manager worked with me through this whole process and was extremely helpful . On the day of the event everything was extremely well planned , far exceed our companies as well as my expectations and the event was a complete success . I want to thank David and his staff for taking such a great effort to make sure that everything was perfect . The food and drink at 720 South is excellent . I recommend it to anyone in the area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro truly is a g ##em ! It ' s been beautifully updated while keeping its historical touch and is nestled in the heart of Chicago ' s Loop / Theater District , but walking distance from the River Walk , city shopping , and so many great locations in Chicago ! From the minute we pulled up we had top notch service ! The bell men , guest services staff , housekeeper ##s , bartender ##s and 312 restaurant staff were overly friendly and kind . Having stayed in many Chicago hotels before , I would choose the All ##egro again without a doubt ! You won ' t be disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The rooms were not cleaned well . Maid service makes the bed , but I highly doubt that they actually clean the floors . The hotel was very busy , so staff was slow and there were long wait times . I had to request a room change due to a dirty room . I ' m not one to complain , but this was gross . Great location , central to everything , but for the price I think you could find something better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ambassador Hotel is a tucked - away g ##em . It is perfect . The staff is pro ##fe ##cie ##nt , cord ##ial , professional and kind . The rooms are lovely and comfortable . The pillows are incredible ( hint to management : buy more than you need and offer to sell them to guests ) . It is now my go - to hotel in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing special . Room size was a little tight . Our " queen " bed felt more like a double . The bathroom was disgusting to say the least . St ##aine ##d tub , awkwardly laid out design , broken door handle , dirty g ##rout . More disturbing than the clean ##liness issues was the odor coming from our bathroom . Pretty sure someone was smoking marijuana in our bathroom ! Front desk didn ' t seem to care when I called to tell them . On the bright side , the hotel location was great . Close to restaurants and attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean well designed , f ##abulous location . Super helpful friendly personnel . They make you feel special , early check - in , handing out water , an umbrella - to - go , daily house ##keeping and evening turn ##down . Just a great place . We got an excellent rate too via their website . Great breakfast in 67 ##6 restaurant . The " double elevator " was not a problem , service was quick . En ##ter on E . Huron , take elevator to 3rd floor check in , then another elevator to the rooms . Made me feel secure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So clean and well kept with such charm ad all of the staff is wonderful . . . Our door ##man Will was just the best , very knowledge ##able knowledge ##able and helpful . . with wonderful suggestions for new ##bies to Chicago . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked the hotel through Travel ##zo ##o and was nicely surprised at the great location and value . The hotel was beautiful and clean and surrounded by many attractions such as shopping , restaurants and to our surprise Star ##bu ##cks Reserve . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a very nice 2nd visit this past week . Our room was clean and close to the breakfast / happy hour room . The hotel ’ s location is perfect for a visit to Chicago ; near the river , State street , Ma ##g Mile . Our breakfast each day was excellent . . . several ta ##sty choices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always look for O ##m ##ni Hotels when traveling because of the excellent service and lovely rooms . We especially like the coffee service delivered in the AM for loyalty members . The Chicago and Indianapolis locations are among our favorites . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Nicole at the front desk was amazing . There was a lot going on at the hotel for the weekend but she made sure I was well taken care of . And the view was awesome . I was able to see the light parade without being in the cold ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Easy check - in and check - out . Friendly staff that says hello anytime they see you . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary evening reception with great service . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary continental breakfast that was great . Perfect ##ly clean rooms and space . All around great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Kim ##pton All ##egro for both business and pleasure over a weekend . The hotel is well located in the loop , and is a trend ##y spot that is close to transit and the river . The rooms were clean and spacious , the lobby was very welcoming and a great place to un ##wind . The staff were very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . This is the second time I ' ve stayed at the Kemp ##ton and enjoyed it very much . Take advantage of the 5 PM free champagne cocktail ##s in the lobby , which creates a lively v ##ibe . The hotel is walking distance from Washington / Wells and State / Lake stations in the loop , which made it easy to get to from Midway airport . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very old hotel , without services , and smell ##y room , in the middle of no where in the city , is that accord group hotel , The room are really old and dirty every where , this Hotel need a big change . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is fine ; Fair ##mont Gold staff and amenities was amazing . Trip was overs ##had ##owed by the fact that the v ##alet lost our vehicle key . The v ##alet is a third party business and not directly run by the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed in this hotel 3 times for work trips , you can take the train from O ' Hare Airport and the station is one block away from the hotel . Walking distance to Macy ' s State Street , Mill ##ennial Park , The Be ##am sculpture and Art Modern Museum . Many restaurants around the hotel . Hotel customer service its exceptional . Hotel Dec ##oration is inspiring . Love this Hotel 100 % [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been visiting the Palmer House frequently over the past 25 + years , but the last couple of stays have been somewhat disappointing . The lobby is still beautiful , but the rooms are entirely ordinary - - and this time directly on the s ##hab ##by side ( cracked tiles in bathroom , scratched tub , thread ##bar ##e carpet ##ing , poor lighting , no coffee - maker . ) Also , it seems that the number of staff has declined over the years - - found long lines both at check - in and check - out . In the future , I think I might go for a drink in the lobby and stay elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The second we checked in was the start to the best customer service I have ever had . Even the bartender ##s at the Big Bar were Fantastic . The room was super clean and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The location was also amazing . we were able to walk to a lot of places we wanted and its so close to the bean ! the views on the river were not bad to look at as well . I would 100 % stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed 3 nights in early December as a weekend get ##away / work trip and we were not disappointed ! The T ##ran ##qui ##lity Suite is truly special , we had a corner suite with ex ##pan ##sive views of the river , Marina Towers , Trump Tower etc . We were walking distance to the Ma ##g Mile and State St shopping . The service at Hotel Monaco is excellent and the room and amenities were top notch . We especially enjoyed the large padded window ledge ##s , large enough for us to sit or lay down and enjoy some cheese ##cake while looking at the city ##sca ##pe . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The accommodation ##s are awesome ! This property was recently re ##mo ##del ##ed and the upgrades are outstanding ! The breakfast and evening social ##s were great and the new open ##ness in the dining area provides a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed three nights while in town for Pearl Jam . Te ##rri ##fic hotel with large rooms and the largest television I have seen in a hotel ( 55 ’ or so ) . The fitness room is one of the best ones I have seen in any hotel . I rarely give 5 stars and I travel at least once a month . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##H ##H ##H I stayed here on the 40th b ##day and it was perfect . En ##joy ##ed being able to walk to Louis V ##uit ##ton ( right around the corner ) Small ##er rooms and elevator was slower than most but I have a nice nights sleep and enjoyed being so close to attractions and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are very small for the money , some stain ##s on the floor , vent was filthy , bathroom had what looked to be makeup on the backs ##p ##lash behind f ##au ##ce ##t . The window in the room leaked cold air and allowed more than enough street noise . Not worth the price paid for the night . Wouldn ' t book again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t was everything we hoped and more . St ##roll ##ing around the Gold Coast neighborhood made us feel like Chicago ##ans . The staff was friendly and wanted to help with everything . From the v ##alet ##s to the front desk to house ##keeping . Our room was spacious and very clean . We had a nice view of Delaware Place . I have never felt as valued and cared for as we were at the Talbot ##t . And not as price ##y as some of the other downtown hotels ! Can ’ t wait to go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No gym ( not conveyed before ##hand ) . First room was not finished being cleaned . Second room had mold in the shower . Third room was fine , but I ultimately ended up spending a good two hours either Chan ##ning rooms or waiting to change rooms . Such a disappointment - my last Swiss ##h ##ô ##tel experience ( Lima ) was so wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location with easy access to public transport , restaurants , theaters , the River ##walk , Millennium Park and Lake Michigan . Friendly staff , clean rooms with an art de ##co fl ##air , nice free coffee setup in the lobby each morning . Bath ##room was small but er ##gon ##omi ##c . The only suggestion I have is to relocate the room safe which was on the floor of the closet . You practically had to lie down on the floor to access the safe and no matter how clean a hotel room appears to be , you never want to roll around on the carpet ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is great location with access to theaters , restaurants and downtown Chicago . Staff is friendly and helpful . Room is small but comfortable . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary drinks between 5 - 6 ##pm was so enjoyable . We so enjoyed our stay and will stay at this hotel whenever we visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location was great and easy access to transportation , Su ##gg ##est ##ions through email for eating were awesome , Room was comfortable and clean and quite , City View was very nice , Happy Hour was a nice feature . I could have saved several dollars if I would have remembered to book my sights ##ee ##ing through the Ki ##nz ##e . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for a weekend and the hotel was great . Had all we needed and more . We travelled with our two daughters and it was great . Excellent location and amenities . Bar and restaurant were second to none and the g ##ran and go was great as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Leah R . made our unexpected three - hour - early arrival a non - issue by cheerful ##ly checking us in - and up ##grading us to a high - floor room . Her positive energy was infectious and we felt very well taken care of . Really , everyone on staff at Hotel All ##egro had a cheerful word and a broad smile for us . It ' s one of the reasons we keep going back . The hotel itself is older , which means smaller rooms - - but they ' re clean and well maintained , with very comfortable beds . We were in such a great location to walk to the Art Institute , Christ ##kind ##lma ##rk ##t , shopping , and restaurants ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gorge ##ous views , big rooms , and quiet ( away from the sire ##ns that plague many downtown Chicago hotels ) . My top recommendation for a reasonably priced , elegant stay in Chicago ( and I ' ve stayed all over downtown ) . Plus it was super cold out and the room was nice and warm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] one of the finest hotels I ' ve E ##VE ##R stayed at . not because it ' s historic or fancy . they Take Care of You ! ! I ' ve stayed here several times . one time I gave my reservation up and called them to say that my hub ##by would be there instead No Problem . they are S ##O A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . the rooms are re ##mo ##del ##ed . beautiful and clean . the shower ##s are to die for . the v ##alet is awesome ! I ' ve had a few embarrassing moments here and we all got a good laugh . I ' ve tried several different hotels in Chicago . I ' ve loved them all . but I keep coming back here . I call the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker first . Always . and they have the M ##OS ##T Inc ##red ##ible Martin ##i Bar ! ! and not to far from Di ##t ##ka ' s . ( steak . mm ##mm . ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was very helpful and friendly . Very nice and clean facilities . A pool would be nice , but this place is definitely focused on business and not family vacation . As far as that goes , I was there for AA ##NA and they had everything we needed . They could use more bartender ##s for large groups . That was the only complaint myself and others had when we had our social ##s in the evenings . Lines for drinks were long because there were not enough bartender ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Family gathering in Downtown Chicago with our family from Spain . We enjoyed the location and its proximity to a market , Michigan Ave . Shopping , and even Navy Pier . It is a well kept property with great service , including a meal or two on the weekdays . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have spent 6 days at this delight ##ful hotel with its stunning entrance hall , true 1920s and 30 ##s el ##egan ##ce which we shall never see again Hilton can be just ##if ##iably proud of this beautiful hotel and friendly staff who upgraded my room to what I had thought I and my travel agent had booked . Room 237 ##0 has stunning views of Grant Park , and the size of Lake Michigan amazed me , this being my first visit to Chicago . I look forward to returning with my partner once finances permit . High ##ly recommended 10 / 10 , well done everyone and thanks for the smiles which made my last week in America delight ##ful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] X ##ln ##t service at this well located hotel in Chicago . Close to restaurants and shopping . Re ##ception will help you find whatever you need and places to eat . Room was great . View ##s are not what this hotel is known for but great value . We booked direct . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Really appreciate the concern for safety and the di ##li ##gence to make our stay be one to remember . I will definitely be back and I ' ll recommend this hotel to friends and family . The staff was friendly and very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here when they first opened and thought I had found a diamond in the rough . . . well , the rough won . The rooms , and we had three , are now nothing more than run ##down tired looking rooms with torn curtains , pictures propped up on desk ##s , and crap ##py beat up beds and chairs . Time to blow it up and start over , or at ##l least patch the wall holes and throw on some paint . . . did not eat or drink on the property , so i have nothing to say about that , but as far as staying there , cannot recommended at all , truly sorry to see this place drop so far so fast . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is very nice and modern with full kitchen in suites . Perfect ##ly located downtown within walking distance of most of the sites . 2 minute walk to Michigan Ave or the river . We asked many staff how to get to the Museum of science and industry which is quite a ways south . We were told many times to take the 147 bus but when we took the bus we found out you need to switch and take the number 6 bus . Otherwise the stay was quite pleasant . Un ##lim ##ited drinks and food for evening social during the week and nice breakfast [SEP]
1	[CLS] * Room was extremely out dated , dark and small ; we had to change the first one given to us ! * A ##rri ##ved early afternoon on a Friday and had to wait until Saturday morning for security to activate our safe ; * Not ##ified in advance at the time of booking , and the day of check in that we were both here to celebrate milestone birthday ##s and nothing was done by the hotel to acknowledge this ; * Unfortunately , not all staff were very helpful nor friendly * We were quite surprised , as a previous visit years ago was amazing [SEP]
1	[CLS] First thing is the hotel is excellent with amazing views and great staff . Thanks to Ra ##quel ( I ’ m sorry if I miss ##pelled her name ) for the great eating suggestions . We enjoyed the location of the hotel relevant to all we wanted to see l . Ra ##quel [UNK] your tips made our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked a room this July for a stay in February and paid a deposit on that room at the time of booking . The confirmation email I received clearly indicated that changes needed to be made 72 hours prior to the stay for a re ##fu ##nd . I canceled that booking recently , but was told by someone at the hotel that my deposit wasn ' t re ##fu ##nda ##ble after August . I finally spoke with a manager , who claimed that she would send the matter urgent ##ly to their bill ##ing department and they would contact me , however they never did . Don ' t waste your money for sketch ##y deposit policies and poor customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Intercontinental is an impressive building with a long history and is billed as a luxury hotel . I am not one to complain , therefore it is with a heavy heart that I have to say that my experience of The Intercontinental is that it is looking tired , there was paint p ##eel ##ing in various places in my room , dirty marks on the paint ##work , m ##ou ##ld growing in the bathroom , red marks ( could be blood ) on the bathroom door . The house ##keeping was spa ##smo ##dic and I had to ask for new cups ( paper ) , coffee pod ##s and toilet rolls after the room had been tended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ’ ve traveled to Chicago many times but this was my first stay at this hotel , tag ##ging along with my husband who was attending a conference in the hotel . I ’ ve come to not expect to much from conference hotels , but was pleasant ##ly surprised by the Fair ##mont . I loved how convenient ##ly located it was to the park , to the river walk , the art institute and some great restaurants like Wild ##berry and Beacon Tavern . The rooms were clean , spacious and taste ##fully appointed . I especially appreciated the light ##ed make up mirror . I wouldn ##t hesitate to stay here in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I celebrated our 2 year anniversary and we decided to stay here overnight as a mini get ##away . This was the best choice we could have made . Our first encounter was with the front desk staff member named Kay who presented us with stellar services from the moment we arrived . She was friendly , helpful and over a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . She made immediately feel welcomed . The hotel de ##cor is beautiful , the staff was excellent , the food is del ##ish and the rooms are next Level clean , even the house ##keeping staff was excellent . We loved the view and we will definitely be returning for another stay in the future . As a lifelong Chicago ##an , this is definitely a g ##em . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location of this hotel ! ! So convenient to river , museums , restaurants , parks and Lake Michigan . So much to do in this neighborhood . I walked everywhere with flowers and parks in every direction ! The hotel was beautiful and I would highly recommend to solo travelers . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was an overall great ex ##pie ##ren ##ce . Unfortunately we only spent one night there , wish it was longer so we could stop by at the restaurant in the same building . We will definitely be booking here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this hotel . The location is excellent , great value , and the staff goes above and beyond . De ##wayne who welcome ##s you makes you feel right at home the minute you arrive . I always look forward to seeing his smiling face upon arrival ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although our short stay to Chicago was superb , with great places to visit . It was let down by our expectations of the Shea ##rton Grand . Basic ##ally , we didn ’ t get the room we paid for ( del ##ux king with water view ) . We were apparently upgraded which we didn ’ t think was an upgrade ! The bathroom although not dirty could have done with a steam clean , the phone didn ’ t work ( so unable to contact room server ) and our biggest disappointment , is the She ##rato ##n have never responded to our email informing them of our experience . Poor Service ! Very disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very nice and the rooms , in ##c ##l . bathroom ##s are clean . The F ##RE ##E drink in the evening really makes your day better ! It is in a quiet neighborhood but close to the river and the Nord ##strom shopping center ; ) The staff is amazing . All of them are very friendly and helpful where ever they can . I enjoyed my stay in this hotel to the full ##est . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really great stay . Bed ##s are very comfortable . Large rooms . Friendly staff . Clean and comfortable . Great view of river walk . We would stay there again easily . Just cross the street from hotel is the river walk . Walking distance to many attractions and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in a great area of downtown . You can walk to all the shopping areas and restaurants . The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile is in walking distance along with Navy Pier and other attractions . The hotel restaurants food was delicious from breakfast to the steak ##house . The only concern was the snack / water tray on top of the desk area is sensor ##ed if something is removed from the tray . It immediately is charged to the room . There ’ s a sign on the tray so please read it first . The view of the city from our room was breath ##taking . We slept with the curtains open . . . . . Price ##less ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] There is a lot to love about the Ki ##nz ##ie . We have been loyal patrons for many years , and it is one of our favorite places to stay over the winter holidays . The location is spot on if you love the amenities of downtown Chicago . The staff is remarkably welcoming , friendly and flexible . You feel like you are in your home away from home . The gym is very reasonable , and the breakfast will get you through the morning no problem . On our last visit to the Ki ##nz ##ie , I had forgotten my winter coat , which was a gift from my wife . I realized the mistake when we were several hours away on the journey home . The folks at the Ki ##nz ##ie quickly gathered the coat from our room and shipped it to our home in another state . It was a class act of a very professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great serve ##ce from Jean the con ##ci ##rge . Poor service at bar , front desk re ##q ##ust for ice , and terrible noise issue from adjacent hotel . Gentlemen at entry way were great . V ##erry welcoming . Location was good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As an airline employee , I truly appreciate a great customer experience and that is what Julius Do ##xy gave me and my colleague . He is amazing ! Great personality and is willing to go the extra mile . Thanks Julius , you rock ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was very welcoming from walking through the doors . The suite , o ##m ##g , the pictures are nothing compared . It was beautiful and we will definitely be back . Thank you for the hospitality and the breakfast [SEP]
1	[CLS] Top location on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and a stone ’ s throw from the Chicago River . The building is a de ##co delight just across the street from the famed Chicago Tribune tower . Re ##ception staff were a delight and the room was large and clean and the bed comfortable . There ’ s a buzz ##y Michael Jordan steak ##house and bar on the first floor and a Star ##bu ##cks on the corner . Excellent . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Thank you Swiss ##ote ##l for an absolutely wonderful weekend stay at your hotel a few weeks ago . We stayed there for our daughter ' s wedding that weekend and it was a wonderful experience . Everyone was so friendly , helpful , and at ##ten ##tive to our needs , even with the Chicago Marathon going on and it was crazy busy , it was still a great experience . We will definitely will be staying there again one day ! Clean and beautiful rooms too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Out ##dated and old . Room ##s have old fun ##iture and the interior has seen better days way back in the past . Air conditioning was installed in early post war days . This hotel needs to be renovated very soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for one night during a weekend . The price was reasonable for being so close to Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier . The room was clean and modern . The ma ##rt ##ini bar had ta ##sty cocktail ##s and a nice choice of app ##eti ##zers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We greatly enjoyed our stay at the O ##m ##ni . The location on the Ma ##g Mile is fantastic for shopping , food , and within walking distance of the Loop . The staff were friendly and helpful and the facilities clean and luxurious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I will definitely be coming back ! I had a great view of the Chicago River and the activities going on . Love ##d that it was a corner room and not very far from the elevator . If there were other people on my floor , I did not know it . Very quiet and rest ##ful sleep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was beautiful , and the location is excellent . Right in the middle of the Loop : we walked to the River ##walk , Navy Pier , Mill ##enia ##l Park , several museums and the Miracle Mile . Very nice employees , very comfortable place to have a drink or a meal . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was perfect for our stay . The three restaurants offered a variety of food and drinks to choose from , it is a beautiful hotel , the room was spacious , and the location was perfect . The staff was friendly and helpful . I would highly recommend staying here while visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in a very nice area of Chicago and it is quite big with many floors . There are some food outlets and a spa / gym as well . The rooms were a ta ##d spacious when compared with what you expect in NY for example . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really great service . Had a great stay . Fe ##lt very welcome each time we came in and out . Book ##ed with a great deal on Trip Advisor . May not have been able to do it without that deal . A ##pp ##re ##cia ##te the hotel participating in that ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is very convenient , only two blocks to the river , close to Michigan Ave . We walked everywhere . We were very pleasant ##ly greeted at check in . In general , had a very good feeling about all the employees here at the hotel . We were on the 11th floor . Our room was quiet , the bathroom was very clean and the bed was comfortable . The rooms have a funk ##y window seat in them , a little awkward to get up into it as it is behind couch and a little tall , but I climbed in to read a book and look at the scenery . It has pillows and a cushion for comfort . Really liked the wine / cocktail hour they have in the lobby in the evening . That was fun to talk to people . Also appreciated the free coffee / tea and in ##fused water in the morning . All in all a good stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay a the Ki ##nz ##ie periodically for work . It ' s a nice enough hotel , although not terribly exciting . While the lobby is lack - lust ##er , the rooms are very large and clean with lots of nice convenience ##s . However , since this seems to be a converted office building , there is some sound that carries from the neighboring rooms ( particularly when blind ##s are opened and closed ) . Some rooms have terrible views of a brick wall . . . or worse , into the cubic ##le of a worker in the office across the alley . Look at the window when you check in to ensure you are okay with the level of desired light and privacy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wow . What a memorable weekend . El ##egan ##t , state ##ly hotel . Every need attended to . Am ##eni ##ties gal ##ore . From the front desk to house ##keeping , excellent . A special thank you to door ##man W ##IL ##L . Excellent , friendly young man . So very respect ##ful to everyone . I can highly recommend the Intercontinental for Chicago accommodation ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in an ideal location for the city , we walked everywhere we went . The staff are fantastic , efficient and very pleasant . The con ##cier ##ge was very useful and knowledge ##able . The room was large , comfortable beds and had fantastic views . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our three day stay in Chicago was exceptional , at Hotel Monaco . This is my first review . I use Trip ##A ##d ##visor frequently and had to share our pleasant experience . The bout ##ique hotel was s ##ty ##lish , clean , and comfortable . The entire staff was warm and welcoming . Our v ##alet ##s went out of their way to be ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . We had a beautiful view of the river and walked to just about everywhere we wanted to go . The best part . . . after checking in , our room was ready with sparkling c ##ider , bottle ##d water , cup ##cakes , and a birthday card . . . all for our son who was t ##uring 13 the following day ! A surprise from the staff . We typically stay north of the river , but we ’ ll definitely be back to Hotel Monaco . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d it , good restaurant , clean rooms , great con ##cier ##ge helped get us tickets to see the Bulls play . , it as my sons birthday so he really loved it , good location near the Pier . The bathroom ##s were nice and big and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly and kind personnel . Location is great . The hotel is clean , renovated and quiet . We had a great time and would consider staying again . I would like to know if they have special deals . The price was somehow high for the size of the rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Po ##s : great hosts at reception and bell staff amazing ##ly pro ##mpt . The Con ##s : rooms very dated . Mo ##tel - es ##que . The restaurants are very poor . Their cafe very managed to create an over ##co ##oked o ##mel ##ette swimming in g ##rease . Di ##s ##gus ##ting . Shu ##las , not owned by the hotel but there , terrible . File ##t and prime rib so tough barely edible . Service in all areas outside of reception poor . In the great city of ch ##ica ##go this is a waste of money hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , helpful front desk and v ##alet staff . A ##w ##ful / sub - par overall experience : we stayed for 5 nights and there were no clean towels or toilet ##ries for two of the nights . Management never showed up to follow up on the issues , even after multiple complaints . The service is that of a 2 star hotel . It is not worth the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I actually prefer this hotel to the one next door for the conference I attended . The room was large and comfortable , most importantly they have the rare separate shower stall and bath ##tub in the spacious bathroom . The elevators were also more secure , you press the floor you want and the elevator only brings you to that specific floor , it reminds me of office building . The room was con ##du ##ci ##ve for work with a good table while the room was nice to return to after a long day of meetings . The hotel is also easily accessible to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and Mill ##eni ##um Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had the most amazing time at the H ##ya ##tt as we always do . We were greeted like they were excited for us to stay there . The city view was amazing as always . The big bar was perfect for a good pre game for us to go enjoy downtown Chicago . Always recommend anyone going to the city to stay there [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome Staff ! ! ! Made you feel like home . IT " S AL ##L AB ##O ##UT P ##E ##OP ##LE . Food was great . Location perfect . Bell ##man D ##wayne is the best ! Perry , Gene and Yu ##lia are the best Ambassador ##s of this hotel . Made you feel like family . This will be our place to stay in Chicago . Perfect location . Small but charming . Outside tables perfect for drinks or breakfast . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are a high school and we hosted our pro ##m at this venue and they were so patient with us and just great hospitality from everyone , I mean everyone . They made it so easy from the beginning of the process until the day of pro ##m . [SEP]
1	[CLS] To be honest we stayed at this hotel because of the beds ! My wife and I stayed at the So ##fit ##el in Ta ##hit ##i for our honeymoon and one of the most memorable things about our trip was the bed . It was like sleeping on a cloud , absolutely amazing . We did a lot of walking and sight - seeing and at the end of the day we both would say , " I can ' t wait to get into that bed " . The hotel is really nice too . ( lo ##l ) Great central location . We were up on the 31st floor and had amazing sunrise views . Small gym but open 24 ##hr ##s . Extreme ##ly friendly staff . Oh and they sell those mattress if you ' re interested . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There for a conference . Large room on 22nd floor looking north and east . We could see the lake and the Ferris wheel and the Lo ##ews . Whole Foods was one block away and saved us as far as food . Park ##ing was $ 55 per day . Easy walk to Navy Pier . The hotel sits on the River and the tour boats go up and down the river all day . Great location and I didn ' t have to pay for the room . Love ##d the speed ##y express elevator floors 18 and up . Ask for a higher floor . Actually the Chicago dog and the $ 14 ha ##mb ##urger we got on the River Walk level were as good as anything we ate in the city . When it was time to drive out of the city we were within two blocks of Lake Shore B ##l ##v ##d which took us to I - 55 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location , room , bathroom and shower , personal , breakfast . Everything ! Even the courtesy chocolate and waters , and the classic music we heard in the room every time we get back . Excellent . I would definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room had a wonderful view and a great location for families as it was just a couple of blocks from Maggie Daily park ( my 6 year didn ' t want ' to leave that park ! ) . The bathroom in this hotel was amazing separate tub and shower I now want my bath at home re ##mo ##del ##ed to function as well as this one . Everything was wonderful until we asked for the alcohol to be removed from the mini fridge . We were told there would be a rest ##ock ##ing fee they later said no fee would be charged but not before upset ##ting my husband for asking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Google maps is not trust ##worthy for finding this location . Hotel is clean and service oriented . Room pleasant , but warm - some difficulty regulating te ##mp . Bath ##room was awkwardly laid out . Food from hotel was taste ##ful . Great location and there is a good v ##ibe in hotel . El ##eva ##tors are go ##of ##y - Too long of a wait . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , great location and with a W ##ON ##DE ##R ##F ##U ##L staff . A true sample of excellent hospitality . A few blocks away you will find the beach , water tower and Michigan avenue ( not even a block ) . Thank you so much K ##wa ##me you made our vacation ##s just great !

1	[CLS] I took my mom to see Hamilton at the C ##IB ##C theater . Had a fantastic time . Hotel room was clean . We enjoyed the view of the lake from our window . Staff was very friendly . We were close to Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier . The restaurant at the hotel was great ! Would stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] To start off - Our standard room is s ##pec ##ious , clean and the the bed is very comfortable . As to surprises - One of the most important amenities to me , when choosing a hotel is the fitness center . To my surprise , the fitness center charges 15 $ daily use ! ! ! Mind you - one uses the gym for a hour and a half ( some more , some less ) and that would be the " daily use " . Need ##less to mention that we paid a respectable price per night . In addition to this price Hilton is requesting more ? ? ? I travel a lot , sometimes we book with the Hilton . But this , to me is outrage ##ous , and a first in over 10 years of travel , it leaves a bitter taste ! Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed : ( [SEP]
1	[CLS] You are somewhat s ##po ##ilt for choice in this part of Chicago as there are huge sky ##scraper ##s all around . The hotel is really big with immense conference facilities , the hotel over ##look ##s the river and looks like it has been around a while . There are v ##alet ##s moving the cars and taxi ##s as you arrive and very pleasant staff man ##ning the reception . There is a cafe serving Star ##bu ##cks and a steak ##house . The rooms were big enough and clean , the food was not very good but this may have been as my visit was as part of a larger meeting . The gym is pretty good and there is even a small swimming pool . I usually stay at the Lo ##ews or the Hilton Water Tower and if they were full I would happily stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] In this trip my friends and me visited Chicago , we really enjoyed it to do , We travel around US and Latin America . We decided to stay in this hotel , i read other opinion and i thought that it will be a good idea . The hotel could be a little bit expensive but has good amenities , nice view , it has good location and nice re ##saur ##ant . When we visited Chicago was before the ##co ##vid ' s 19 pan ##de ##mic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is by far my favorite hotel in Chicago . The rooms are beautifully done and the beds are so comfortable . The location is the best . Right by a red line stop . The red line takes you everywhere ! Within walking distance to all the great shopping on State Street . Plus the beautiful lobby . I ' ll never stay anywhere else while in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was very at ##ten ##tive and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . Great location . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast and evening social make it a great value . Walking distance to Eat ##aly and Trade ##r Joe ’ s if you want to make your own food in the room ’ s kitchen ##ette . Can have pizza delivered as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to visit Chicago for 5 days and decided to choose a bout ##ique hotel , since we had such good luck with one in New York City . Ken ##zie Hotel was very nice . . . room was excellent . . . breakfast available in the hallway of every floor , every morning . . . Happy Hour was a great experience with compliment ##ary wine and beer . The ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vres were wonderful . . . . you could practically have dinner there , but there are too many good restaurants in Chicago to try ! The only construct ##ive criticism I have is that the lobby looks like it was set up overnight and didn ' t have a professional appearance . It ' s just a bunch of office desk ##s pushed together and I wondered if I was in the right spot to check in . Need ##s improvement ! Everyone was very nice so that ' s a good thing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had one night at the Hotel Monaco to enjoy a bit of Chicago after a week long stay and the McCormick Place Convention center while exhibiting for a large show . From the moment the cab pulled to the curb , the service was excellent . The room was very nice , clean and comfortable . The location is wonderful unless you are bothered by the sound of the El . It is within easy reach of any part of downtown . We missed the evening wine hour because we headed out to the b ##ur ##bs with a friend from the days when Chicago was home . This hotel was so pleasant , I just wished we had been able to stay longer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed for three nights . The hotel offered a free room upgrade . The hotel room itself was very spacious , with a large walk in wardrobe and large bathroom . It ’ s not the quiet ##est location , not helped by a noisy air conditioning . The breakfast menu was very elaborate , and not well executed . A room service dinner was also poor for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in upgraded room on 21st Floor , which was quiet , very clean , and cool for sleeping . As Diamonds , we had excellent free breakfast in Lock ##woods off the lobby . Found house ##keeping , really all staff , especially Con ##cier ##ge desk very helpful . Have stayed here on and off since mid six ##ties - and love the gorgeous lobby , and independent shops like Me ##rz ’ s - a lot ##ions and skin and hair care place that is a delight . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for a long weekend . The room was clean , and in great condition . Staff was very friendly . We didn ' t have a car , but there was a taxi stand just a block away that made getting around very easy . There were only two things I would change - the elevators were really , really slow - so slow we ended up taking the stairs as much as possible - and the windows were super draft ##y . With te ##mps in the 20 ##s , it was hard to keep the room at a comfortable temperature . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They often say third time ’ s the charm , well in this case , first time ’ s the charm . Everyone provided top not , at ##ten ##tive service , especially Rosemary in House ##keeping . This is a bout ##ique modern European style hotel . I loved our room . We chose the king suite , and the room is extremely spacious . The bed was comfortable , the shower was great , and the double sinks were a nice touch . I love all of the extra ##s like the coffee in the morning , the plus ##h robes , and slip ##pers . The hotel restaurant is very delicious . ( One is the best meals I had while visiting Chicago ) . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bed was uncomfortable . Pi ##llow ##s were hard . Em ##p ##loy ##ees at restaurant were rude and dismiss ##ive . Ho ##rrible view directly into office building across the street . Vale ##t parking is $ 59 / day . Lu ##x ##ury pricing without luxury service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad offered a special I was fortunate to obtain . Didn ’ t know what to expect , but was pleasant ##ly surprised . The staff , scenery , & restaurant were all very inviting . Didn ’ t get to walk Michigan Ave like I wanted , too wind ##y & cold . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall very good room with a nice view of the Lake and Millennium Park . Up ##graded to a special package including breakfast / happy hour / free w ##if ##i as our room was not ready . The bed was V ##ER ##Y hard and the head ##board looked a little sketch ##y with material p ##eel ##ing off . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel ! Room ##s are clean . This hotel has a great location with restaurants and shopping within walking distance . However the staff was the best part . Everyone that we came into contact with was friendly , professional and helpful . I [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great staff . Love ##d the room and the bathroom , it was huge . Right off the mile , perfect for walking everywhere . Room ##s are quiet no complaints about noise from outside or other rooms . Would return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The usual quality service and comfort one expects ( and gets ) from So ##fit ##el but with truly excellent food at the Cafe Des Architects restaurant . We din ##ed there three times and were delighted with the various plates ; starter ##s , main ##s and , especially the gorgeous dessert ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] I used points to stay here in December . I had mini ##bar credit but noticed a random unidentified charge of almost $ 60 on my credit card from this property . I called to in ##quire about the bill ( which I never received at check ##out ) , and when it was sent the charge was magical ##ly removed . Note , I hadn ' t asked them to do this , I just wanted to see what I was being charged for . Seems they knew it was b ##og ##us without even having to ask . . . Hmm , why would that be ? Check your bill . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am s ##tok ##ed about returning to this hotel . This time we have the Allison Victoria room . This is a great hotel in a great area . Staff is wonderful ! You must stay here if you come to Chicago . I called to confirm a few days ago and talked to the front desk who remembered us . That says a lot for a hotel with this many visitors . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Property - A ##wes ##ome . I stayed on 15th floor corner room . . . king suite . . . . beautiful room with all top notch facilities . Beautiful view G ##ud N ##es ##press ##o coffee , compliment ##ary water Auto ##mated blind ##s and black ##out Front desk is on 20th floor and check in & out was has ##sle free Staff - helpful ##l and competent The guy at con ##cier ##ge was very co - or ##dial & his suggestions were worth a visit . Restaurant - must visit rooftop & g ##ud food Location - Perfect , walking distance from eating joints , shopping , mill ##eni ##um park Room ##ser ##vice - ordered chicken soup . . . delayed service but were a ##pol ##og ##etic Total ##ly recommend this place . Both my visits to Chicago in Conrad & Lo ##ew ma ##g mile have been g ##r ##8 [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were clean and spacious . Along with a super delicious restaurant right on property . The best part was the front of the hotel door ##man . They are extremely helpful and court ##eous . Noel is amazing and made a tense l ##y ##ft situation better with suggestions and patience . I highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hu ##ge thanks for the entire Conference and Ban ##quet staff . I ' d specifically like to point out James Jenkins . He was absolutely exceptional . I can ' t forget C ##J and the rest of the staff . Every staff member in the conference area was always willing to bend over back to help us out . You don ' t find that often when an entire team works together so well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location in The Loop . Excellent staff , clean and neat room . Good sized room and bathroom , although the shower seemed on the small size compared to everything else . There were some unique window seats in the room which I thought was really cool , great place for a reading a book with a cup of coffee . The bed was comfortable and the W ##i ##F ##i was fast and easy to connect to . The only b ##um ##mer was that I only stayed for one night as I was on a quick business trip . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel provided a great family experience and the service was excellent . The compliment ##ary breakfast ##s and social ##s helped us save money and keep everyone in the family satisfied . House ##keeping , parking and the desk teams were also so awesome ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I just stayed two nights at the She ##rato ##n Grand . Room wasn ' t ready when I checked in , but they sent me a text when it was . Upon opening the door to the room , I discovered someone was already in the room . I called down to the desk and told them I didn ' t want to wait in the long checked in line again . The very nice customer service representative told me to go straight to the SP ##G line , after she apologized many times . Got a new room and was upgraded to Club Lounge and received many more a ##pologies . Their staff is AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] this place was really nice , clean and quiet despite being pet friendly great location , walking distance to many attractions and transit routes all the staff ; from the front door , to the desk , to the house ##keeping were great and all very helpful can ' t think of any issues at all ! some rooms will have a river view without actually being officially " river view rooms " but i doubt there ##s a ton of those so i probably got lucky [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , excellent location . Quite . Room only had one small chair . Ex ##pect ##ed a little more from the property for how high the night ##ly rate is compared to others in the area . I would stay again but only if I got a better rate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve lived in Chicago more than 5 years and can ' t believe I didn ' t know about this g ##em ! We did a weekend stay ##cation for our anniversary and will definitely be making it a tradition . Great communication and service from all the staff . W ##oke up to a text inviting us to compliment ##ary ( and delicious ) Bloody Mary ##s for br ##unch in the on site restaurant ! And enjoyed some of the best b ##aco of my life . An ideal location . Do yourself a favor and don ' t just do Michigan Ave and the traditional tourist ##y spots . Gold Coast is a vibrant neighborhood and there are dozens of unique local restaurants , bars and entertainment within walking distance worth checking out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Ambassador last month for a long weekend while in Chicago for a wedding . The hotel is on a quiet street in a nice neighborhood , and a short walk away from restaurants and entertainment . Our room was spacious , clean and made when we arrived . We were greeted our first evening by Kay at the front desk . She stuck out as a highlight of our trip - welcome us back every time we saw her , giving great local tips and cracking jokes . Thank you , Kay for making our weekend ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although there were a few very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff members , my overall stay was not impressive . Upon arrival , the desk staff were rude , the room was dirty , & the facility needed maintenance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family is currently staying here and I am so impressed that I need to post before we leave . I have a lot of kids - as in traveling circus . I made a special request prior to arrival and was pleasant ##ly surprised to see it handled with a ##p ##lo ##mb . The v ##alet device was sea ##m ##less and the check in was even better . Maria took care of us at the front desk and was so welcoming and helpful . She even ran into the elevator to give our kids a story ##book - above and beyond . Our luggage was brought up immediately - sea ##m ##less is , again , the best des ##cript ##or . The rooms are beautiful , clean and well equipped . This hotel is a g ##em and they have clearly em ##powered their staff to make a difference . Thank you , Maria . Strong work . We look forward to the rest of our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] great location ! nice AG package - best one I found after looking at all of the hotels . really good service - had room service which kids loved . nice indoor pool - tons of kids there so very kid friendly . restaurant with nice big windows and great kid friendly meals .

Thank you Leah , Christina and Todd ! The room and bathroom were spot ##less upon arrival and the bed was very comfortable . Thank you k ##im ##pton all ##egro , I will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is amazing . Beach is a walk away . Room ##s are so pretty . Need to have coffee machine in the room and water is $ 6 per bottle ( unnecessary ) . Staff were really nice . Would stay there again for the location ( especially if you are going to a ball ##game ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] I would definitely recommend this hotel . The location was perfect . I loved the wine hour every night ! The staff were all friendly and helpful . Our room was large and comfortable . My only complaint is that our bathroom could have been cleaned better . Overall I would definitely recommend staying here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed many hotels over the years and the So ##fit ##el on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile is one of the best . The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant , the location was excellent and the food was fault ##less . Well worth staying there the beds are exceptional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not a luxury hotel but a great price value . My rate was 130 / night for a downtown Chicago hotel . Ad ##ja ##cent to the E ##L so convenient transportation links . Close to Art ins ##ti ##it ##ute and Mill ##eni ##um Park . At ##tract ##ive de ##cor in lo ##bb ##ies . Room ##s are small and only chair was a desk chair . No on room coffee service . But otherwise a nice comfortable room . Lots of walk ##able restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my second stay at this property , and needles ##s to say I have walked away both times happy and content . This would be my hotel of choice when visiting Chicago . Why ? - Location , Location , Location . The hotel is a walk away from most area you want to visit in Chicago , and we pretty much walked everywhere . - I ##mp ##ec ##ca ##ble clean ##liness and customer service that can be associated with most So ##fit ##el properties - Pro ##xi ##mity to a lot of places to eat - On - site restaurant and bar - Room ##s with a view [SEP]
1	[CLS] Shawn welcomed us as loyalty members beginning with first reservation call , follow - up call to ensure our needs were planned for through greeting upon arrival and ensuring all our needs were met throughout our stay . Very clean pool area allowed me to swim my laps each evening and quiet room for good nights rest . Each desk attendant was exceptionally nice , professional and engaging . Looking forward to our next visit at the O ##M ##NI Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Second time I have stayed at the Ambassador . The best part is the proximity to the lake and downtown . Room ##s are great , modern , clean . Nice amenities and good service . Good spot for a business stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay here twice a year for business meetings . Staff is great - very professional and helpful . Check - in and check - out lines are long . Room service dining very expensive - recommend going out and experiencing the best food and restaurants in the USA . They served an excellent lunch at the conference rooms . The room cleaning service very good . She noticed I used the body lot ##ion and the next day there was a bigger tube ! If you have trouble finding the hair dry ##er - it ’ s next to the towels in a white bag ! Iron did not work though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you ’ re looking to see the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , and have a close proximity to food , shopping , theater and Navy Pier , this is a great choice . Fair ##ly reasonable , and close walk to anything you need . I don ’ t recommend parking here , as it will run you $ 72 USD per night . I used Spot Hero A ##pp and found a much cheaper spot very close by . The rooms were clean and staff was friendly . I did use the gym and pool , which were both nice . No hot tub , which was a minor b ##um ##mer . My only complaint was that the hotel rooms are extremely tiny and cramped . We couldn ’ t even find a large enough space on the floor to open a suitcase . The closet and bathroom were also cramped . Otherwise , very good . Would stay again for location and convenience . Love ##d having a full Star ##bu ##cks on the main level ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My parents always stay at this hotel when they come from out of town to visit , and I finally had the pleasure of staying at the Talbot ##t during the weekend of my wedding . The rooms are beautiful and the staff are top notch . D ##wayne has to be my favorite - he is so warm and welcoming , and always greet ##s me , my parents , and other guests with a smile . Charles is also amazing , and always makes me feel like I am coming home . Hat tip to these 2 fell ##as and the rest of the crew that make it a pleasure to be a guest or visitor at the Talbot ##t ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What an amazing hotel . Beautiful , ups ##cale , right in the heart of Downtown Chicago . Just a couple blocks from Michigan Ave . with great dining & shopping . The entire staff was excellent , Jerry was very professional & helpful at the front desk . The room was spacious , and very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was setup like a suit with the bed in its own closed off area . I pretty much just slept there but it was a nice room to come back to . All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful . Food and drinks at the bar were also very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great experience at this hotel - wonderful , g ##rac ##ious staff and the suite was very clean and comfortable . Love the kitchen and the front desk accommodate ##d my request for a late check out . I really appreciated the door ##man at the street level as a woman traveling alone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Could not have been a better weekend , the hotel location is great . All the workers were very nice and helpful . Many restaurants and shopping choices in the area all with easy access to public transportation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super friendly and funny staff at check in ! Room was newly re ##mo ##del ##ed and gorgeous . Bed was really comfortable . Del ##icious breakfast with many choices . Great location , we will definitely be back . We loved our stay ! Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well my great view was the river . I tried to block the view of t ##rump tower . Nice 33rd floor lounge to access for Star ##wood frequent travelers . It is two levels with p ##c and work space too . Good ##si ##zed hotel room . Short walk to Michigan avenue or even navy pier . They have restaurant option on main floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed my stay at the Fair ##mont . I had a del ##uxe King room and it was like a suite , very clean . The maid left a bottle of water at my bedside every night . I especially enjoyed the Gold upgrade , which included a beautiful view of the city with a full breakfast every morning . Man ##dan ##a was the server on staff all week and she is so pleasant and took great care of all the guests while I was there . T ##ip ##hani , the con ##cier ##ge , was absolutely wonderful , very sweet and helpful for literally anything I needed . I ’ ll definitely stay at the Fair ##mont again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very well situated with easy access to city sites , exploring on your own , shopping and great dining ( in b ##ouse ) . Room ##s are well appointed , are . lean as well as comfortable . Great for a business or leisure stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I wasn ’ t sure what to expect I have never stayed at a So ##fit ##el property . Check in was a breeze front desk was prepared and friendly . Room was nicely appointed as was the bathroom . Great view of the city from the 16th floor . Le bar downstairs was a nice place to get a drink before or after dinner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely fantastic trip - brilliant city with lots to see and do and a great v ##ibe to it . Hotel was in the best location , just off the magnificent mile and the centre of town , on the same block was a great diner which had a massive menu to choose from and the food was generous and ta ##sty . Can ##not fault the hotel itself , lovely room - com ##fies ##t bed i have ever slept in , lovely open space at reception which also s ##mel ##t amazing as you walk through the door . Bar was busy and had a good atmosphere . Staff very helpful and happy to book trips or call cab ##s etc etc . Would go back tomorrow . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful staff , especially Dan , Drake and Ra ##fi . Fantastic location close to theatre district , shopping and great restaurants . Room was great and loved the free , amazing breakfast choices on each floor . Just walk out of your room in your robe and grab coffee , m ##uff ##ins , cereal , yo ##gu ##rt and fruit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was the 3rd time I have stayed at this beautiful property when I have been in downtown Chicago for business . My room was very clean , and the W ##i ##F ##i worked fl ##aw ##lessly even with my Fire ##TV stick ! Dinner was an awesome salad bar that evening with a great soup . Breakfast was very complete , and had lots of options . I have stayed at other Hilton properties in downtown , and this one remains my favorite . It is within walking distance of Michigan Avenue , and right across the street from The Shop ##s of North Bridge . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were there one night for business and it was a pleasure . Room ##s were very nice and staff members from the door ##men to the front desk and everyone else were incredibly friendly and helpful . Great extra ##s like an afternoon hot chocolate bar ! Would have liked to have stayed longer to use them all . I ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here one night for a quick trip to the Wind ##y City . From the moment I booked this hotel , the employees were extremely friendly & helpful ! Once we arrived , Can ##dice offered us an upgrade to a river view room . This was much appreciated by my relatives . This was their first trip to the city . The hotel was very clean and the beds were very comfortable . We weren ’ t here long , but I ’ d highly recommend and will stay again when we return to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time at 720 South Bar & G ##rill located inside the Hilton Chicago Hotel . Dinner for two , seated right away . Our server was an absolute g ##em - she made the experience that much better ( shout ##out to Em ##el ) . They had a great food , delicious app ##eti ##zers and a fantastic wine list . I will definitely go back here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location and service at this hotel is top notch . We were in town for the Lights Festival on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and could not be more satisfied . All of the rooms have separate living room and bedroom accommodation ##s . The room service was delicious and pro ##mpt . The view from our room overlooking Michigan Ave for the parade was perfect . We will stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My second visit to O ##m ##ni Chicago . Love the room layout with separate seating area . P ##lent ##y of room to relax and spread out ! All the staff were excellent right from the front door to restaurant , front desk and house ##keeping . Location is perfect with shopping , sight seeing and many restaurant options within blocks of the hotel ! We walked everywhere [SEP]
1	[CLS] Be ##ua ##ti ##ful clean place with excellent service and excellent location . We have stayed before and loved It then , but now the place is gorgeous ! Staff is super helpful and friendly . You can walk right out front door to The Shop ##s at North Bridge right into Nord ##strom ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is in a te ##rri ##fic location near the river and close to all . So can ' t not beat the location . The room we were assigned was facing a brick wall and had absolutely no view . Nothing remarkable about the room otherwise . We love the Monaco in Philadelphia , this property is not nearly as special nor as colorful . I ' m sure the experience would have been much different , had we gotten a room with a view of the Chicago river . Next time in Chicago , Monaco won ' t be on top of our list . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay at the Intercontinental . The front desk staff was efficient and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , allowing us early check in when we arrived ahead of time ( they also permitted late check out for our friends staying there ) . The room was comfortable . My kids really enjoyed the pool even though the water was cool ; and the family movie pools ##ide on Saturday night was a fun bonus . The fitness facilities are very nice with plenty of equipment and space . Would definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was the first time we stayed in this hotel and it was a great experience . Clean and com ##fy suites . It includes breakfast and light dinner with beer and wine . Their breakfast employees are extremely helpful and nice , specially Ivan and Lu ##pit ##a . Our only concern was that we have to eat scrambled eggs for 12 days , only the last day they added wa ##ffles . Another thing is that this hotel has their lobby in the 6th floor , everyone has to enter in an entrance prepared mostly for employees . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First stay in a H ##ya ##tt Regency Hotel was not good . Custom ##er care not good with the exception of “ The Liv ##ib ##g Room Bar ” the staff there were excellent but this was only open a few days a week and had to get out of there because it was booked for specialist conferences / food . Zero communication about the hotel or what support they offered marathon runners i ##e early breakfast . Transport - no mention of transport to airport . Just felt like one of thousands not an experience I have had in other large hotel chains . Will not go there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed in hotels all around but had not stayed in the She ##rato ##n before . From front desk to the bell staff , The car guy to the maid ##s , all staff were super nice ! While on the subject we had dinner at Shu ##la ' s stake house and found every thing perfect . The wait staff was very good just under staffed . Hard to deal with excess tables . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was close to water Tower Place and the John Hancock building . The door personnel were always there to open - door and say Hi . When we first arrived door personnel directed us to elevator and told us the main desk wells on the third floor . We had a great time at this hotel . We ' ll probably re ##book another time when we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The good , comfortable bed , quiet for being close to everything , clean room and nice front desk & con ##cier ##ge staff . The bad , dated & worn looking room furniture , terrible restaurant ( 3 people for breakfast @ $ 90 and it wasn ’ t even very good . ) Sur ##ly restaurant staff with attitudes , except for the Bar staff , they were great . The worst was the shower , terrible water pressure to the point of having to stick my head under the tap in the bathroom to r ##ins ##e the s ##ham ##po ##o from my hair . You have to pay for internet use in the room . Really , in this day and age , charging $ 15 a day for internet in a $ 300 a night hotel ? Fair ##mont is one of my favourite hotel brands and this one doesn ’ t measure up to the name . Better choices in Chicago for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here 4 days and enjoyed every minute . Located in the heart of everything , the O ##m ##ni is the perfect local for a Chicago adventure . The staff was friendly , the rooms were clean , the gym was fantastic and the location is wonderful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I travel a lot for my job and stay in many hotels . So ##fit ##el ranks # 1 in my book . Not only is the hotel clean and simply beautiful , each employee makes me feel welcome and comfortable . It ' s my home away from home ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I wouldn ' t change anything about my stay . It was beyond perfect . It was also located in the center of everything that we planned to do which was awesome because we saved on Tax ##is . I plan on staying here every time I go to Chicago . Although it is a ta ##d expensive , it ' s worth it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here at the Ambassador Chicago , the staff here was phenomena ##l . They gave great food recommendations , were polite and made me feel at home . The leadership team here is obviously leading by example because the entire team no matter the shift throughout my 4 night stay was really great . In particular Kay was so nice and and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! If you looking for the best Ambassador Chicago is it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel ! The room was spacious & modern . The bed was so comfortable & the dual shower was splendid ! The check - in process was speed ##y & efficient . They also gave us token ##s for compliment ##ary drinks . Would highly recommend the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel & plan to return the next time we are downtown ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed here for our anniversary weekend . We got a corner view room on the 19th floor with a great view of the City . Our room was very nice and well appointed . Staff were friendly and court ##eous with a great breakfast . Location is ideal to take in the best of Michigan Avenue without the higher prices . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really nice hotel , awesome views . Right in the middle of downtown . Steps from mi ##chi ##gan a ##ve , river north or navy pier . Ke ##enan at he front desk was really friendly and helpful . Would definitely stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] There was no w ##ow factor considering the type of hotel it is supposed to be . The room was ill lit , the windows were not sound proof , so you could hear emergency vehicles all night long . The pool and work ##out area was nice though . The parking garage was not available [SEP]
1	[CLS] Another great stay at the Fair ##mont Chicago . Special thanks to Mu ##gi and the Re ##ception Staff as well as Patrick and . Gold Lounge Staff for attending to all the details ! Knowing my preferences for my stays is big factor in why I return and will continue to do so . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent ! Beautiful hotel in an ideal location . Room ##s are lovely and the service is fantastic . Staff is extremely friendly and helpful . Food is a bit price ##y , but delicious . I would definitely stay here again . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great experience at Talbot ##t this past weekend . Host ##ed 13 of my friends for a fantasy football draft in one of the conference rooms . The room was great - very ups ##cale and classic look . The hotel as a whole is very nice - I ' ve stayed there once before and loved the feel and design . Food was top notch ( bottom ##less na ##cho bar with ch ##ori ##zo , wings , slide ##rs ) . And service was great . I worked closely with L ##yn ##sey R ##uck who manages the events for Talbot ##t . She was awesome - very re ##sp ##ons ##ive and focused on ensuring I and my friends had a great time . She certainly delivered . I would highly recommend the Talbot ##t for an event like this ( wedding , corporate , fantasy draft , etc . ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome hotel , the location , amenities , dog friendly ( $ 0 ) , happy hour , coffee / hot co ##coa bar , and v ##alet were all outstanding . Kim ##pton has to be the most pet friendly group out there . They provide the bed , water / food bowls , treats , bags , and City tips . The location is ideal , walked everywhere from Grant park , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile , & Michel ##in rated restaurants . Wife loved it , puppy loved every staff member who gave her a treat and rubbed her belly . We ’ ll be back in the spring . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hilton was the perfect location for the C ##lick ##con event ! The rooms were well appointed and comfortable . The various locations within the hotel made for wonderful shooting opportunities ! The small sandwich and snack area provided a quick grab and go spot for meals . The staff were court ##eous and welcoming , ready to assist you with any of your needs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Food was excellent , de ##cor elegant , service staff was g ##rac ##ious . A table ##cloth was overlooked but the oversight was re ##ct ##ified and was put in place before the company came . Guest ##s and family came for our wedding ceremony , guests left while our family had a private dinner . After a 2 hour dinner , guests returned for a C ##ake and Champagne party . Music was performed by Andy David , a f ##abulous ##ly talented keyboard musician and vocalist . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is gorgeous ; bar in the great hall with beautiful historic architecture is populated with locals and travelers feeling special . Great downtown location . Room ##s clean and quiet ; but " Double " beds are a bit on the small side for two . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for business . They had to move my rooms three times when I checked in because of the smell of weed and cigarette smoke . I had extremely noisy neighbors , and I called the front desk several times for them to help me , but they never returned my call or followed up . They offered to clear out the mini bar so I could use it to store medication , but they never did , even after calling down 5 different times . This was one of the worst hotel experiences I ’ ve had . I travel 265 days out of the year and I stay at many hotels . I give this rating a huge thumbs down . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of my favorite places to stay when visiting Chicago . Staff is very helpful and friendly . Live ##ly bar in lobby with great drinks and great lo ##ung ##ing chairs , becomes a coffee shop in the morning . Always a clean room , comfortable bed and well equipped shower . The location can ' t be beat ! Walking distance ( if your a walk ##er ) to De Paul , Old Town etc . Very close to the park and waterfront . Have stayed in many other places in Chicago before finding this g ##em and will keep coming back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The on - line availability of check in and check out , were huge time - save ##rs as the lobby was he ##ctic with huge groups of convention go ##ers . The rooms were small , very clean and quiet , but the lobby was constant chaos . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the arrival hello by the door ##man , Harry , till his final goodbye , staying at the millennium was purely magical . Very at ##ten ##tive staff , beautifully appointed rooms , quiet and peaceful and yet right in the very energetic heart of downtown Chicago . How much more connected can one be ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has the best service , friendly , close to all major events , restaurant and bar is excellent . High ##ly recommend to all people that visiting Chicago and local . Bell ##men are very knowledge ##able of recommend ##ing food and shopping . This is plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The chief selling points for this hotel , for me , are the staff ( addressing me by name after several months away ) , the full kitchen ##ettes ( drinking coffee from an actual ceramic cup ) and the two - room layout of all the suites ( I wake up before my husband , and there ' s somewhere for me to work other than the bedroom ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best Hotel Nice Food & Staff Worst Internet I would recommend this to others ! Nice location too : ) I kinda liked this place very much Nice thought providing evening drinks and snack ##s It helped me a lot , since I was away from family so It saved lot of cooking time & E ##ff ##ort A ##pp ##re ##cia ##te that ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In ##dira took wonderful care of my daughter and me . We were allowed to check - in early , and she upgraded our room to accommodate our needs without sa ##c ##ri ##fic ##ing the gorgeous view . Oh and she even sent my daughter some delicious cookies ! We deeply appreciate the superb service and fantastic experience in this lovely city thus far . We would be delighted to return , and the Swiss ##ote ##l has our u ##t ##most recommendation ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have many favorite hotels in Chicago and tried this one because of a good deal at the holidays . Excellent location about 3 blocks from the Loop , with city , lake , and river views . Very quiet , as many high rise hotels struggle to limit street sire ##n - type noise . Bath ##room nice , room large enough , and com ##fy bed / pillows . I would assume all the views are good . The afternoon check in line was terribly long , but a breeze at 11 ##am when we arrived . We will certainly try to come again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , quality hotel , exceptional service , gorgeous large room . When we needed a roll - away , it was delivered immediately . The view was exceptional . I would stay here again and again and again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our company stayed here for our annual meeting . The staff was friendly ; the rooms and bathroom ##s nice size . They have an evening cocktail reception which was nice . The continental breakfast left a lot to be desired . B ##read products we had were pretty s ##tale ; the hard boiled eggs over cooked — like rubber . Su ##gg ##est spending a few bucks at a local restaurant if you enjoy breakfast options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for visiting Chicago and excellent shopping central ##ly located outside of Hotel . The O ##m ##ni is a gorgeous hotel with excellent staff . Room ##s are spacious . Staff are extremely friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I can now see why Op ##rah has this as one of her favorite things . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here before but this was the best . Staff all had a great and friendly attitude which always makes a difference . Me ##als were good and staffed well . Location of hotel is super - 1 block to CT ##A and 2 to Michigan Ave . Room ##s quiet as well . Will return if price is right . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here during recent conference in Chicago and suit ##ably impressed . Good size modern rooms well equipped and well appointed . Excellent shower , big TV and good coffee machine . Breakfast amazing although would be expensive if paying separately . B ##rill ##iant location close to million ##aire mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##mme ##nted on previous page . Here for a 2 night wedding and only stayed because it was on the invitation . Web site looks very nice but the first room I was in was worse than my son ' s dorm room . I live in south suburbs - would of had transportation to and from my house than staying at this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have stayed in this hotel twice in the last ten years . It is an excellent hotel that is within walking distance of many of Chicago ' s sights . The breakfast b ##uff ##et is well worth the money and the staff at the hotel are ready to assist you in any way . We will definitely come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent the night for New Yes ##rs . . . what a delight . Cha ##rming bout ##ique hotel near the Ma ##g Mile . Hotel staff is awesome top to bottom . Special shout out to D ##wayne , the awesome ##st Bell ##man in town ! B ##runch s ##t 20 ##e was del ##ish as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Money well spent . Room ##s were spacious , even a small mini bar area that was perfect for 4 guys having fun in the city . Great location , walk ##able to many attractions . G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s is just around the corner and is worth multiple visits for their deep dish pizza ##s . I only wish the beds were queen ##s and not doubles , but the view made up for it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms look lovely online , but are in fact V ##ER ##Y small and cramped . Just seems like it needs a re ##fu ##rb - the the ##rm ##ost ##at didn ' t work , shower didn ' t drain , hallway ##s re ##ek ##ed of weed , and walls were paper - thin to the point where conversations next door and in the hallway were very clearly audible . Although the service was excellent and staff went above and beyond , I could not recommend this hotel . Location was the main per ##k . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was beyond my expectations . Just an excellent stay . The location is perfect for shopping , sights ##ee ##ing and family fun . In terms of dining options , the restaurant offers a variety of options . The hotel is also near a variety of attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was traveling with friends and stayed at O ##m ##ni . Location is great and service was excellent . O ##m ##ni staff ( Nikki front desk Manager ) is great , she was extremely polite and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I will definitely recommend it to others . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you are looking for a great hotel in downtown Chicago , this is a great hotel . The service is exceptional , as is the location and hotel am ##men ##ities . I promise , you will not be disappointed with your stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The look of rooms and hallway ##s are very dated but our business meeting was in this property . And it is acceptable but seriously needs a re ##f ##resh . Service was good , quality of mattress very good . Meeting rooms are the best part and work well for the size of our society . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ing at this Intercontinental is always a good choice . As I already mentioned in previous posts , location , customer service and quality of accommodation ##s are of high standards . During my last visit , however , I found that rooms in the north tower are not as good as those available in the south tower . If I ' d anything to suggest for improvement , this is what I expect this Intercontinental to do better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ent hotel , nice enough service , big rooms , and perfect central location ( walking distance to anywhere ) . Breakfast not the best ( eggs a & g ##rits only hot food on show ) , but overall it ' s a 4 star stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great experience at this So ##fit ##el , which we booked through hot ##wire . The hotel is in a great location and the king room was spacious with a very comfortable bed . The con ##cier ##ge was extremely helpful with giving local advice and even sending our post ##cards for us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly , meeting rooms spacious . Bath ##room small / cramped . Light ##ing dim . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds / mattress ##es . Bar / meeting areas accessible with good bar food . Excellent location for downtown visits / sights ##ee ##ing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got a room here as one of last ##min ##ute . com ' s ' secret ' hotels . The main thing that sold it to me was the wine hour ( ! ) , but I am so pleased we stayed here . The best bit about wine hour was meeting the other guests - there ' s a really nice v ##ibe in this hotel , and it shows in the people you meet . Our room was great - a f ##abulous view over the river - and I could have sat for hours on the massive window seat ( even did so in my animal - print bath ##robe while having a rather nice glass of wine ) . Great location to start and end a day ' s exploring ( loved Chicago ) . Staff were great . I ' d definitely try another Kim ##pton ( and fellow guests recommended their other hotels too ) . Sign ##ed up for their guest programme and got free w ##if ##i . Great place to stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel ' s location is pretty good . We walked around the magnificent mile and shop ##ped . The room ' s decoration was good but it wasn ' t clean enough . The w ##if ##i didn ' t work most of the time and the restaurant from the hotel was very expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . First time staying up in the Gold Coast area , this hotel was convenient to Second City , Chicago history museum , Lincoln park and zoo , etc . The hotel was s ##ty ##lish , the room was very clean and was a good size . Would definitely stay there again . ( Oh also , the t ##ruff ##led scrambled eggs at the hotel restaurant made for a great dinner one night ! ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff made our day special . Plan on returning during the warmer months ! ! ! ! We have stayed here twice before with the same level of service . Keep up the good work . We plan on re ##vis ##iting in the summer when the weather is better for walking and seeing the sights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Does not have lights enough , no view for even 100 + $ a night . Very small room . Some complementary stuff / packaged food / fruit would have been great . Since most of the time there are tourist here a lot of hard copies of the map , attractions to visit and getting around could have been better . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a great time in Chicago I stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker and was helped by the manager Si ##me ##on who made my night special for my wife I ' d definitely be staying again . The location was convenient as well for the cruise I took her on [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was a suite with a desk and den , bath , and bedroom . Nice ##ly located close to Northwestern and shopping , just off Michigan Ave . The bed was comfortable and shower room ##y . My only criticism is that unlike most hotels today , there did not seem to be any ability to re ##cycle , re ##use towels and linen ##s unless you declined house ##keeping totally . I travel a lot and most hotels offer a separate trash bin for re ##cy ##c ##la ##bles and a way to communicate the desire to re ##use towels by the way they are hung . Good experience , but I wish a stronger " green " effort was available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I booked a room through hotels . com , today , and after checking in , realized that the price of the hotel room was $ 100 dollars more expensive than what was quoted on Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker ' s website . After a family member , who has been a longtime guest of the hotel , explained our situation , K ##wa ##me ( our front desk clerk ) upgraded our room free of charge to a bigger suite . Thank you K ##wa ##me for your kindness and consideration . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We picked this hotel to stay in the I ##H ##G chain , it location to Chicago downtown neighborhoods and the red ##line . the Red ##line was a short walk and easy trip to W ##rig ##ley Field . The room was a little small but the bed ##ding was so ##oo comfortable . Be careful of the mini ##bar it is on sensors . very nice seating area above the main lobby [SEP]
1	[CLS] In this large , old hotel , re ##f ##resh ##ed r ##oo ##ams are comfortable with modern , clean lines , com ##fy beds , and spot ##less fun ##tional baths . Part ##ial and lake view rooms are particularly nice . I had a partial and had to sit just so but could easily see lake . Great fitness center with running track ( 1 / 18th mi ) , lots of machines , swimming pool and hot tub both indoor ##s . Conference facilities are in need of a re ##f ##resh and could use better a ##v tech ##s . Lines for breakfast at casual cafe we ' re WA ##Y too long . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had to wait in the lobby more than half hour to check in A ##FT ##ER our check in time , no big ##gie but the lobby was PA ##C ##KE ##D . Our bags and our persons kept getting moved and bumped in to . We had nowhere to ST ##AN ##D that wasn ' t in the way . At last , finally someone who worked there noticed us and brought us some ice water . Our room was B ##OR ##ING , white walls and white sheets and not much else . However , the blood stained sheets were more than we asked for . Personal ##ly , I am a customer service person and that was A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Conrad Hotel in Chicago and this place was nice . Great location , great staff and a great experience . Would definitely stay again whenever I ’ m in town . Walking distance to millennium mile with restaurants , art galleries and shopping gal ##ore [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotels location is perfect and close to everything on Michigan Ave . The hotel room itself was a disappointment . It was very small , had p ##eel ##ing ve ##neer , and very out ##dated . The beds were extremely comfortable but small for 2 of us in each bed . The one surprise that we did get was a big slice of birthday cake . This cake was brought to our room while we were out for the day . It was a wonderful surprise as we had been walking around aim ##lessly trying to find dessert . With no luck , we went back to our room only to find the cake . I think that this hotel needs some up ##dating and bigger rooms . All of the staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was f ##abulous ! We had a great time and view from the room was great ! Really enjoyed our stay . Easy walking distance to everything in downtown Chicago . Will be staying here again ! ! Staff is super helpful . [SEP]

The location to everything was wonderful ##T ##han ##k you to everyone for such a wonderful stay at your lovely property ! We will definitely stay with you again when we ' re in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the O ##m ##ni for one night recently while in Chicago on business . It is very well located for shopping , restaurants , and museums . Even though I travel on a government rate ( which is not generous ) , I was put in a suite with a large living room , a huge bathroom , and a comfortable bedroom . It was very comfortable , quiet , and clean . The front desk staff was friendly , efficient , and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The rooms do look a little out ##dated , but honestly that didn ' t matter to me . I felt very much at home in the hotel , and have reserved a room for me there for another upcoming trip to NY in a few days . I would glad ##ly continue to stay there for both business and personal travel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Kim ##pton is in a perfect location right on the river close to the action , staff was excellent ! The only reason I am giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is the rooms seem to be getting slightly worn but overall another great Kim ##pton stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came into town for our wedding anniversary and stay here . We needed to go to the cu ##bs game earlier in the day so went and they got us checked in at 10 am which was so nice to get situated in our room before the game . Hotel has so many amenities . Staff friendly and helpful . Great location in the city . Super clean . And the bed was incredibly comfortable . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary coffee and tea ##s in the morning . And rooms have a stock ##ed mini bar and Ku ##eri ##g with many different choices . Hu ##ge closet in rooms . Rob ##es slip ##pers . Big t ##v . Automatic shades with black ##out curtains . Room 211 ##4 had view on Hancock building . Lots of restaurants and shopping around . Would definitely return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A simply beautiful and historic hotel in Chicago ( close to the Loop and Millennium Park ) . The hotel is impressive - restored lobby , public spaces . Bed ##room was a ta ##d small but well appointed . The gym is well equipped . S ##hame the pool was out of service ( and check in did not advise on an alternative offering ) . De ##fin ##ite ##ly would return , it ’ s a sight to see and you feel the history and heritage of this landmark hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family stayed on the Gold Floor for the week of Christmas and had a wonderful time ! The hospitality that Man ##dan ##a shared each day made our week special ! Man ##dan ##a is a true representative of the Fair ##mont culture ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was wonderful . Perfect location , great breakfast and know ##led ##gable staff . I loved bringing my grandchildren here . Looking forward to returning again . I didn ##t know about the compliment ##ary social hour though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very poor customer service . Called front desk and reported a loud bee ##ping noise running for hours next to my room from ice maker machine . She said ok , I ' ll send someone ( without any a ##ck ##no ##wl ##ed ##gment of my frustration and very cold tone ) . After an hour no body showed up and I called again . Again with a cold tone said ok , our engineer will be the ##r shortly ! Again without any op ##ology . Then I asked about a time estimate and she said I can ' t give you a time . I expect at ##lea ##st an op ##ology ( a simple sorry ) , more visibility into when other than ' shortly ' and at ##lea ##st some options like changing room . Very disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is set on two different blocks . You can take a walkway from side to the other . I was in the West Tower and my room was very good . I had a view of the river and out to Lake Michigan . Staff at the hotel were all very helpful . Our meeting room was just right and the food / drink service was very good . I will say the meeting room itself was relatively inexpensive , but the add - on ##s are quite expensive ( $ 400 to use the TV as a monitor , internet $ 40 , and the box lunch meals were $ 55 ( good but expensive ) . If you enter the parking garage on lower W ##ack ##er Drive you will have to Vale ##t park ( $ 93 ) . There are other parking options , but I would suggest using the v ##alet service . When you need your car they bring it promptly , usually quicker than they say to the front door . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great overall downtown Chicago stay . The biggest issue was parking and the lack of clarity on how parking worked . Act ##ual hotel was great . The room was very clean and modern . Our view was fantastic of the city and lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful rooms right at magnificent Mile shops Very nice restaurant and friendly staff Modern style property with all amenities you need Very close to w ##rig ##ley field . A must do is have dinner at the Sign ##ature Room at the Hancock Building [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was attending L ##ymph ##oma ##C ##on ##ference over the weekend at another hotel . Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal was a convenient location to the conference . Check ##in went well , room was comfortable , staff were helpful . I would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##hr Intercontinental Hotel is my favorite place to stay in Chicago . My room had a magnificent view of the River and the W ##rig ##ley Building as well . The perfect location , on North Michigan Avenue and near Eat ##aly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the time we spent in Chicago . The hotel is convenient to downtown . Staff was great , from the Door ##men to the Maid ##s . They looked after is quite well ! The She ##rato ##n is a short walk from parks , restaurants , and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at the She ##rar ##on Grand Chicago for our daughter ' s Nike Tournament of Champions basketball games and we were blown away with the service ! John the door ##man was a amazing ##ly helpful and pro ##active in every encounter ! He is a valuable resource for this hotel ! Bart ##ek was also te ##rri ##fic and helpful in all our needs and requests ! Amazing staff and location ! Thanks ! ! Doug F [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the Hotel Monaco . My family and I have been regular ##s for years . The rooms are in the process of being upgraded . But almost all of the have lovely window seats , and the view of the river is nice . The new restaurant is a great addition ; but what stands out to me at the Monaco is the service . Antonio , Jonathan , Ronald , and Ph ##yl ##ici ##a are the best — and always willing to help . The Monaco is great for business trips as well as for weekend get ##away ##s . I highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Family stay ##cation at the Hilton during winter break is always a blast ! ! We love swimming at the pool . Re ##lax in the hot tub . We can have dinner on the premises if we really want to relax or the kids love B ##ub City so if we feel like vent ##uring out that ’ s our go to spot ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand is located on the Chicago River with wonderful views of Lake Michigan . I stay at this property a few times a year . Always ask for a water view room during check in . I often get an upgrade at no cost ; depending on hotel o ##cc ##up ##ancy . Room ##s are always clean and the beds are very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing hotel . My best O ##m ##ni experience was the Chicago O ##m ##ni . Amazing a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly staff . The location couldn ' t be more ideal , right in the middle of all the action of shopping , restaurants and bars . The rooms are spacious and comfortable . All the rooms are suites so it ' s like being at home from home . . . . . . . . . 5 + Stars . Looking forward to my next stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our second time staying at this hotel because we loved our first stay . This hotel is walking distance to practically most of the top main attractions in Chicago . You can take the river walk across the road to Navy Pier , this is only a couple of blocks from the Mill ##eni ##um Park . Great restaurant and room service ! Happy hour a bonus ! Very efficient check in and check out process . I felt safe during our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel this past weekend . Spencer checked us in , and he has a really warm and welcoming way about him . We loved the location , easy walking to so many restaurants ! Was really nice to have a little continental breakfast , and evening wine reception . Would stay here again ! Thanks to all at the Ken ##zie ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 9 days at this very nice hotel . The location is absolutely perfect with everything within walking distance . The rooms are spacious and very clean and all staff very positive and service minded . I will definitely come back next time I go to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here 2 nights for a conference and we had a spacious suite . Service was excellent location is good and a great 4 star hotel but you expect 5 stars at a Fair ##mont . The shower head needed replacing or to be soaked in CP ##R , the entry door was in need of replacing and we couldn ' t get hot water in the shower on the second morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After Or ##bit ##iz messed up and lost our reservation at different hotel on a holiday weekend . Paulo at the front desk was extremely helpful finding us a room to fit our family & dog . He saved our vacation ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In Chicago speaking at a conference that was held at this hotel . I ##mp ##ec ##ca ##ble service , lovely food and a French v ##ibe that lifted both the mood and spirit of the conference and it ’ s attendees . Large hotel rooms , conference spaces are perfect for a more intimate number of guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came through on a work trip . Re ##ceived great service . Check - in was sea ##m ##less . The king bed so so com ##fy , and I slept well . Was grateful for the black out curtains when sleeping and the bright light and full pan ##ora ##mic view from my corner room the next morning . Will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park recently and enjoyed the hotel experience . The location is superb , within walking distance of many sights : Bean , Mia ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Boat tours , the lake , etc . Check in was efficient and room and service were excellent . Would stay here again . Not cheap but worth it ! [SEP]

I will always go O ##m ##ni and the staff go out of their way to show you your valued . They welcome you to a wonderful experience when traveling to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From An ##t ##wan who helped us with luggage , Al who v ##alet the car , to Kelly who checked us in . All these representatives of the hotel were very polite , professional , and a ##cco ##mo ##dating . The training manager has done very well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone at the hotel was friendly , from the front desk staff to the v ##alet assistants . The hotel was overall clean and comfortable . The compliment ##ary evening social was great - substantial app ##eti ##zers / light fare and compliment ##ary wine ! The compliment ##ary breakfast was also good . These compliment ##ary meals were a definite per ##k . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago is perfectly positioned on South Michigan Ave . right across from the parks and lake . just along from the f ##abulous Art Institute of Chi ##ga ##co and the equally f ##abulous Mill ##enne ##um Park with An ##ish Kapoor ' s ' bean ' and Frank G ##eh ##ry ' s bands ##tan ##d . The hotel is ' grand ' in the best old style . Room ##s are large and mine - room number # 101 ##3 - had a great view out over the parks and lake . Wonderful early - morning and evening views . Staff were very friendly and helpful . Nothing too much for them . Clean ##ing staff ( mine at least ) did a wonderful job and everything was im ##ma ##culate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for the weekend of the Chicago Marathon . . . cannot say enough about the service from the hotel and the excellent staff . Room ##s were nice and extremely clean , bed was very com ##fy , and the staff was the friend ##liest I have encountered during my travels . . . all during what is a very busy weekend in Chicago . Actually got engaged that weekend and the staff helped participate in the surprise and even upgraded me to a suite for no additional charge . To top it all off can ' t really find a better location with all the good night ##life and restaurants just a few blocks walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was spot ##less , secure and full of wonderful treats , drinks and amenities ! The staff were extremely professional and the attendant at the door " De ##wayne " took great care of us and had a ride waiting every time we walked out of the hotel . the location was convenient and I felt very safe as this was my first visit to the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Do have to be there . Very comfortable ; Was a pleasure , very calm and everybody are very kind and disc ##reet . So ch ##ic also . Very central , close to many places that must be seen in Chicago . Great beds and calm rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for 2 nights , I arrived late and they had no king rooms and they put me near the elevator ( which is in my profile that I hate ) . The room was large , the bed was comfortable , but the shower was filled with mild ##ew . Now that is not difficult to remove so come on She ##rato ##n , up your game ! ! Back to the H ##ya ##tt or Fair ##mount for me ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an excellent stay , and I ' d highly recommend this hotel . We ' ve stayed at other So ##fit ##el Hotels , and they never di ##sa ##pp ##oint . The location was right off of the magnificent mile , and easy to walk through most of downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel entrance lobby area was clean with hand sa ##ni ##ti ##zer pump . Check in area which is on the 6th floor was very safe and clean with p ##lex ##ig ##lass barriers for protection . Hotel rooms was clean and described accurately on the website . Had electronic key access through app on your phone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing meal served at wedding and guests still r ##ave about it . Paige is wonderful to work with . Vale ##t guys - - the best ! We experienced a rainy day wedding and Marvin D - - went above and beyond helping us ! Thank you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the new Conrad for 5 nights and loved the rooms and am ##men ##ities . However , I was very disappointed with the fact that my husband ' s birthday was not remembered even after reminding the staff 3 se ##per ##ate times - I was told they were going to send t ##ruff ##les / champagne to the room . I think a lot of the staff are very young and new to the hotel industry and it shows . We enjoyed the food at the first floor Italian restaurant and had great service for lunch . Also , they no longer have the house car and only water in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was treated very well the room had a living room bar area with flat screen and gaming system also had same in bedroom with king size bed room came with slip ##pers and robe nothing but comfort also has laundry service [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and classic You are greeted with kindness and efficiency when you arrive The desk staff is amazing . Check in is quick and easy . The room is comfortable and the view was amazing . Check out was as quick and easy as the check in . The door ##men are so kind and fun . N ##est body products in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Despite a lower rate at Ex ##ped ##ia on the exact same day ( I made this reservation the day of the arrival , I asked A ##cco ##rs personnel whether they could meet the price of Ex ##ped ##ia for the exact same room . They said they could not . Ask ##ed what I get for the extra $ 30 for booking through A ##cco ##rs , I was told I get the points for the stay . So what is the value of those points , I asked . I was told I get a free welcome drink , and not much more . Great . So I never even was told I had a welcome drink awaiting me at the bar , or much else that my membership points added to the stay . Overall , when price is price , make sure that your silver members get the value deserved for the E ##XT ##RA money they are paying for the exact same room and service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The good - the service at this hotel was amazing . Very clean . I would recommend it for a business meeting or lunch . However , I would never recommend spending the night here . Later on my U ##ber driver told me exactly why - it ' s located next to a busy hospital ! I had no idea . Didn ' t get any sleep as I heard ambulance sire ##ns all night and even in the morning . We stayed in the Executive Tower which was beautiful , but I didn ' t really get to enjoy it considering the loud noise at night . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is a relaxing atmosphere , close to everything you need but located on a calm and beautiful neighborhood . I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Chicago for a good weekend get away . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super ##b accommodation ##s and service at a reasonable price . Breakfast is a special treat given that they probably have as good bag ##ue ##ttes as any place in America in addition a broad range of very ta ##sty fresh fruit . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Only one comment , I took a shuttle to the H ##ya ##tt Regency Hotel , thinking that I was going to the Regency Chicago , the driver ( I asked him ) , took me to the wrong hotel ! I trusted that he knew to ask which Regency do you want . This is just a comment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we checked in four nights , we knew this was worlds apart from staying downtown . . the hotel property was beautiful and every staff member we had encounters with were very friendly and always helpful . the neighborhood was a total bonus . We won ’ t stay anywhere else and now that our kids just moved here , it ’ s great to have a place close by them to call our Chicago home . . a few people to call out amongst this great staff were Sam , the perfect ambassador . . Paolo and Jacob at the front desk and Jose and August ##in who took every request with a smile … great hotel and a great value compared to the river area hotels . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel and staff were great I loved the text m ##s ##g they do it ’ s very convenient the room could probably be a little more sound proof but glad it ’ s a dog friendly hotel ! ! Didn ’ t like the fact I booked with a reservation ##ists and the hotel didn ’ t see the same thing I booked so I got doubled charged for v ##alet hotel is located in a great place to walk everywhere [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the She ##rato ##n Grand with my mother and two year old daughter , and we had a very relaxing and enjoyable stay . We booked a suite which allowed my daughter to go to bed while my mom and I stayed up . The suite was very nice with two separate bathroom ##s , a large dining area and living room and a separate bedroom . We had no trouble getting cab ##s or walking right from the hotel to many of the places we wanted to visit downtown including Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier . The desk staff was very at ##ten ##tive , helping us with questions and concerns . The front desk manager ( Eric Ball ##en ) was great at assisting me with my booking and follow - up questions . We will definitely stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand next time we visit Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice and staff was awesome . wonderful breakfast , staff , evening social and the suite was very nice and clean . I would stay there again and recommend it . The lay out of the floors was unusual in that the check in desk is on the 6th floor not the first , but the staff and online services were wonderful . I would go on and on but It is at the end of the day and s ##tu ##pit Trip ##A ##d ##visor needs a minimum of 200 characters in order to post so I am wasting time and characters in order to get this comment posted . I really did have a great stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great historic hotel with an absolute beautiful lobby . However , the room was a disappointment . . . . . . . . a tiny bathroom . . . . maybe 5 x 5 feet with no counter top areas . Plus the room had double beds . . . . . . . . . not even queen size beds . Next time to Chicago , I would definitely visit the lobby bar but I would stay somewhere else for a more comfortable room [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent the weekend in downtown staying at the Intercontinental . What an incredible hotel and location ! We spent out time exploring the city . We found the Intercontinental put us within steps to outstanding shopping , restaurants , and attractions . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I usually stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie for work and pleasure . This work trip was a quick overnight to attend a meeting and training session the next day . I went to drop off my bag and was pleasant ##ly surprised that they offered to check me in at 11 : 45 am ! This allowed me to not only drop off my bag , but get a bit of work done from my room before my meeting . I love this place and am encouraging my team to stay here whenever they need an overnight in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful stay ! Room ##s are perfect ! Staff is wonderful ! ! Ask for T ##ies ##ha ( T ) at breakfast , she is amazing and provided wonderful service ! Tom was our waiter in the evening and he provided wonderful service and very friendly ! The staff who took care of our rooms went an extra step for us and provided us with cables ties to keep our phone , i ##Pad charge ##rs nice and organized ! Things like that and the staff make me always come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location but very disappointed for a 4 star hotel . 3 of 6 nights in the hotel room service was not available , including 2 weekend nights . $ 75 / nights ##t held for incident ##als was high . T ##rash was not taken out of room completely 2 times . Con ##cier ##ge gave 2 salon re ##cc ##s with phone numbers but no offer to help with reservations . I can go ##og ##le just like anyone else to get the number . Thanks buddy . Sorry to bother you . The front desk was helpful and fantastic overall which was the saving grace . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We all enjoyed our stay ! Service was excellent . Love ##d the renovations . Clean room and very comfortable . Kids loved the pool . Breakfast was so good and the staff was so efficient with the high demand of many guest dining . The elevator was out for a little bit and we were personally escorted to an alternative elevator . The staff went over and above our expectations . The location was perfect . Across the street from a mall . Around the corner from a grocery store and restaurants on every corner . It could not have been better for our stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was there December 28 - 30 , 2018 for a wedding . Hotel was great - especially fitness center & magnificent P ##O ##OL ! ! ! But what stood out was the service provided by staff members , particularly Mo ##ro who went above and beyond when it came to check ##out day and having luggage held all day long . His constant smile and personality really made a difference in our stay at the Intercontinental . I truly recommend this fine hotel ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is comfortable and inviting The desk staff was nice The room was better than average , but just by a bit Good , comfortable bed Their new de ##cor ##ating is jazz ##y - and needed The restaurant is interesting and unique Interest ##ing guests Great location near Mi ##ch Ave I will stay here again [SEP]

1	[CLS] This was a very nice hotel to have a large conference at . The staff were all exceptionally friendly . The location was fantastic . Didn ' t care much for the rooms but the rest of the hotel was very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was with a group of Brazilian passengers to attend a fair in Chicago and stayed at the historic Hilton Chicago Downtown . Great location in the heart of the city , walking distance to many sights , especially The Loop and Chicago Bean . Around the corner is the blues bar Buddy guy which is a place you can ' t miss . Inside the Hotel there is an Irish pub too , a great convenience store and a Star ##bu ##cks with a lot of que ##ues . The apartments are large with 2 bathroom ##s due to a renovation of the old building and kept the old bathroom , so when sharing a room with a co - worker , this hotel is a great option . Bad point : luggage storage is a service outs ##our ##ced by the hotel which leaves us with no quality option . The ballroom is spectacular with its antique ch ##and ##elier ##s and classic ballroom style . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Brand new hotel with state of the art community ni ##tri ##le for curtains and lights . Love ##d the room / bathroom layout . Bed was com ##fy and the air conditioning was as cold as I wanted after a hot summer day out . This was one of the best designed Conrad ’ s I ’ ve stayed at . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a good hotel but not the best I have stayed in . A little di ##sor ##ganized . The cleaning staff were great . Room was a bit noisy but not enough to go through the has ##sle of changing rooms . May not stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , easy walk to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile but very much a " neighborhood ' v ##ibe in surrounding area . Great service . Charge ##s a " resort fee " . House ##keeping placed dirty towels on top of " clean " towels at some point , which was not great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very disappointed in the layout of this recently updated room ( 150 ##5 ) . The sink was not accessible ( see picture ) - blocked by toilet - and the closet was less than 12 inches deep , which was inadequate . The sound isolation between rooms was poor - could hear adjacent room conversation . The room was updated , but very small . Given the bread ##th of hotel options in the area and my very basic requirement for a functional room , I would not stay here again or recommend the property . The overall property was well maintained . Stay ##ed one night on business . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Area and ease of the hotel , made it a major hit with us ! They definitely hit out of the park ! ! Would stay again , without any questions ! ! Location is very ideal , for travelling to anything around the " Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile " [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted the Palmer House for New Year ’ s Weekend . Good location and central ##ly located near many attractions . Love ##ly hotel . The service at the hotel was good . Only issue is the walls are thin and you could hear your neighbors and folks in the hallway . Otherwise , we really enjoyed this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was lucky to be travelling with my boss , who booked us at the Conrad in downtown Chicago . Beautiful hotel with an incredible staff ! The apps in the bar were spectacular , and the breakfast was first rate . Best orange juice ever ! Was travelling on business , but would highly recommend for a romantic weekend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie this past week and couldn ' t be happier . The staff is con ##s ##cie ##nti ##ous , helpful , and court ##eous , our bed was so ##oo com ##fy , and the continental breakfast hit the spot . The cocktail ##s at happy hour go perfectly with the delicious app ##eti ##zers . I noticed another review that said he didn ' t have a good view , but our room actually had a pretty nice view . We will definitely be back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a very nice experience . The hotel , the staff and everything above was great , I would recommend this place to everyone . GPS was not good in the area so I drove past it a couple times . Park ##ing is not funny , v ##alet is the way to go , but its a little spend ##y , otherwise awesome place . I don ' t think you will be disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were booked at the Chicago Renaissance . Upon arrival we were told we had been moved to the She ##rato ##n . ( Business Group Block Book ##ing ) OK , so we went to the She ##rato ##n where we were told we did not have a room ! ! Problem , large convention in town , we were part of , and all rooms in both hotels are booked ! So - the very nice She ##rato ##n people worked hard to find us a spot . We ended up in a room with a view of the river and lake that the original o ##cc ##up ##ant had not showed up for the previous day . Thank you She ##rato ##n ladies ! ! ! Just in time too , taxi ##ed immediately to attend meetings ! Room very nice . Clean , in very good shape . We had a very good stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location and excellent service . I would definitely return and highly recommend this hotel . The rooms were very very clean . We ordered room service for breakfast and were very pleased . It was brought right on time and everything was hot and delicious . Best bacon ever [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice , friendly , professional , com ##fy beds and just all around class ##y hotel . Of course , Trip ##ad ##visor is just ridiculous and one has to write at least 200 characters , therefore , the So ##fit ##el is nice , friendly , professional with com ##fy beds . Class ##y hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has the best staff in Chicago . Stay here and you ’ re right the in Mecca — near the magnificent mile , Cloud Gate and Millennium Park , the museum campus , Navy Pier . . . the list really goes on and on . Stop in the bar at the Fair ##mont and visit with Ser ##or . He makes an amazing old fashioned and knows the city like the back of his hand . He ’ s never given us bad or disagree ##able advice on where to din ##e and visit to make sure we always get the most out of our Chicago visits . If you ’ re not staying in this hotel , be sure to at least visit and definitely ask for Ser ##or . Oh , and if you want to bike around lake shore , you get a free bike rental if you rent a room here . Absolutely love it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was extremely helpful and printed out locations of restaurants and bars in the area they recommended . Location was amazing ! ! Walking distance to many museums , parks , theaters , and great restaurants . Would definitely return ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Perry and Taylor took such great care of us , we were kind of high maintenance and they were so nice , took care of all our needs . Taylor even brought us a fan to help us sleep ( me and my daughter kept waking each other up ) . I loved the staff here and how close it was to everything we wanted to see . Thank you everyone ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We did the upgraded king room so had a corner 17th floor room so could see the lake , the river , and downtown . It was large enough to contain the king bed as well as a love seat and a chair so it was super comfortable as we are watching all the lights down below . The house ##keeping staff was excellent . The front desk staff even helped me find lost gloves that I had lost a couple days earlier . We ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Con ##cier ##ge , David Moore , was above and beyond a ##cco ##mo ##dating and welcoming to set me up with everything I needed for my work trip . He was mi ##rac ##ulously familiar with the nature of my work and my recent health condition , and I was touched and delighted to find that while I was out , he tailored our room to a ##cco ##mo ##date my special needs so that I could th ##rive , personally and professionally , during my stay at the Kim ##pton All ##egro . I look forward to staying there again during my next visit , and I hope he gets a magnificent raise before then . Also , the beds and bath ##robe ##s were supreme ##ly comfortable . < 3 [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stay at hotels about 100 times a year and I have to say the staff here is the best I experienced all year . So so friendly and helpful . I felt like I was staying at a four seasons . And to be honest this place is really really nice too . When I ’ m in Chicago I would never stay anywhere else . There ’ s no point . For the price they charge you get so much value . Free champagne from 5 to 6 . Free coffee in the morning . They gave my two dogs compliment ##ary toys and p ##oop bags even treats . They don ’ t charge let feed either ! I can ’ t stay enough good things about this place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First , need to mention that a night stay there is E ##X ##P ##EN ##SI ##VE . My ad ##min books my trips and I was shocked when I checked out and got the bill . . . $ 480 for one night . The hotel lobby is amazing , the restaurant is excellent and it ' s a great place to hang out . Need ##less to say , future trips to Chicago will find me at a more business - expense friendly hotel ( still with a Hilton brand ) . But , if you need to meet up with someone downtown , this is a great place to do it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Location , efficient and friendly staff , wonderful view in a corner suite , reasonable price , compliment ##ary breakfast and social was good . This hotel was clean within walking distance of Ma ##gni ##ci ##fen ##t Mile , River ##walk and all the major sites . Would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everyone working there was wonderful . The room was clean , spacious and close to everything . I can ' t think of anything I ' d change about our stay . We ate breakfast downstairs one morning and was worth the money . The morning coffee and tea service is very appreciated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had to book a room for a conference at the last minute and wasn ' t sure how to get the reserved room rate online . I took a shot in the dark and e - mail ##ed for help . Ms . Crystal Math ##is gave me a call right away and patiently talked me through the process . It relieved a lot of my stress , and it was a great introduction to the hospitality at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay for a few days in Chicago . Super close to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and other attractions like Hancock Tower and Navy Pier . Great location , very friendly staff and nice rooms as well . Free drink coup ##ons were a nice touch as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We wanted something special on my wife ' s 60th birthday , which was modern and close to Michigan Avenue shopping . We were impressed with the room , the bar and the breakfast . Our room on the 32nd floor had a magnificent view of the city , with bits of the lake also visible . the Con ##cier ##ge attendant was very friendly and helpful . My wife was extremely happy with our choice overall . We will recommend , and stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing customer service in a gorgeous hotel . This location is so convenient to Grant Park , She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , and the Natural History Museum . There is a double deck ##er tour bus stop right out front with jump on jump off passes that take you to all the sights . Great gym and pool too ! S ##p ##lu ##rge for a lake facing room . . . the views are amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This building , now a Hilton Hotel , is a beautiful historic location . The interior is close to the original decorations with historic photos and displays form the early days of the hotel . While the Executive Level room offer extra amenities ( free soda , ho ##rs d ' o ##eu ##vre , etc . ) , they were nothing special and the dinner was below average . The room was nice and clean . And the staff were friendly . Excellent location to get to much of the theater and arts in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed in every other Kim ##pton in Chicago and we were so happy to complete the tour . The All ##egro is beautiful . The staff is amazing - - - We were S ##O happy to use the social password and be welcomed with it ! ! ! The rooms are small but the amenities are so beyond worth it . I wouldn ' t think twice . My final night I had a very loud group in the next room That was tough but I ' d do it again . L ##O ##VE K ##IM ##P ##TO ##N [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the second time we stayed here . The suite was room ##y and comfortable . Staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Restaurant is just so - so . K ##nock ##ed one star off because one of the elevators was out during the weekend and the wait was a bit long . All in all a pretty good hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience , staff was friendly , helpful and pleasant . The breakfast and compliment ##ary social hour were great . There were several families with young children during our visit , that appeared to be having a great trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] spent 4 days here , located in a con ##ven ##ent area of the city with in walking distance to a lot of fun place and fantastic restaurants and Navy pier , can ##t say enough about the pool built in the 20 ' s , and even the door ##man Hesse ##in ( s ##p ) was a big help showing us around the hotel one night after we got got back and asked about the dome , rooms were clean and not cramped like a lot of downtown rooms . Bar was fun , and Star Bucks right next door , Will stay here again . Many Thanks , ch ##uck and Michelle [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for four nights . Great location to Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan . Easy access to path along the lake to walk , run or take in the beach itself . 10 or so minutes to the nearest L Station and minutes from shopping . Lo ##bby was under renovation and as result a bit more cramped than our previous stay . Room was as expected for a heritage / classic type property ( not expecting modern touches and furnishings ) . The mirror in the bathroom was very odd as it was far too high to use to get ready in the AM . Light ##ing was poor in the bathroom as well . We did not use the hotel bar or dining as so you areas close to so many different locations for food and drink . Staff was ve ##y helpful , assist ##ive to questions we had for getting to specific locations and na ##vi ##gating the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 2 nights at the beginning of our Route 66 Journey . Perfect ##ly located near the major Chicago attractions with plenty of restaurants nearby . The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable . En ##joy ##ed our stay here and wouldn ' t hesitate to come back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful bout ##ique hotel with a friendly staff who ' ve been there for as long as we ' ve been visiting the property . Great food and superb location , a neighborhood feel with easy access to the lake , shopping and abundant restaurants . High ##ly recommend this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed here when we were in town for a trade show . It ' s a great neighborhood , affluent and on the north edge of the Rush street area so close to clubs and restaurants , although its own rest ##au ##aran ##t is quite good . Very good service from house ##keeping and the reception . It ' s a very trend ##y and ch ##ic hotel outside and inside the rooms . I would definitely stay here again as a preference if I can get the same rate I got the first time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in a room off the mail hall , across a small side - hall from another room . Between 1 and 4 am , my neighbor came home and left and came home again . The walls were extremely thin , and so I was awake between 1 and 4 am . It was an app ##all ##ingly loud property . I was incredibly disappointed , because in all other respects but sleep the Public was lovely . When I told the manager upon check out of the noise levels at night , he com ##ped the cup of coffee I had ordered from room service . This seemed an insufficient response , which was also disappointing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is a 10 to 15 minute walk to many tourist attractions , and there are numerous restaurants nearby . Our art de ##co style rooms were quiet and equipped with yoga mat and a charging station . W ##i ##F ##i was fast and reliable , but there is an extra fee unless you are a rewards club member . It was nice to have free coffee and tea in the lobby in the morning . People were helpful and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pen ##d a week at that Hotel . Just g ##eni ##ous location for walk or visiting either on foot by the river cruise or bus hop on hop off tight in front of hotel . Great restaurant at the hotel and near by . No need a ta ##ki or car to get there . Short ta ##ki ride from Oh ##are or Midway airport [SEP]
1	[CLS] Web ##site didn ' t mention the restaurants were closed . . dirty room , had to obtain amenities for room ourselves . It seemed to be in ##con ##ven ##ience when asked for things . No turn down service . It was like staying in a cheap motel but paying well over . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My business stay started poorly at this supposed luxury hotel . Check ##ing in at 6 : 15 ##PM on a week ##night , you would expect adequate front desk coverage , especially when it appeared there was some conference group arriving at this time . One person was at the desk with 6 people on line when I arrived . Eventually a second person came out to the desk but waiting 20 - 25 minutes to check in is just not acceptable . I provided this feedback and was told by the manager that I was wrong . That didn ' t help . The rooms are just average and are old and lack the modern convenience ##s of working outlets in accessible places , like most modern or updated hotels have . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved at the H ##ya ##tt , unsure of the location . To my surprise it was right next to the Chicago river . Was pretty much able to walk everywhere . The coordination of bus pick ups and information regarding where right on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attend with my family to a Family Room ( 2 kids , 1 baby , and two adults ) . 1 ) The Family Room is not so big and the microwave on the room was missing even do ##e it is indicated on the room description . I had to call asking for it . 2 ) I had to call to request my complementary w ##if ##i because the network was charging me a fee . 3 ) I asked some packages to be delivered on the hotel but no one announced me that they arrived . 4 ) Food choices on hotel are limited for a Family . 5 ) I still checking with them the fare charged to my card . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was right out of the 20 ' s in character ! The rooms are on the small side but ( bout ##ique ) but 100 % modern ! The rooms are exceptionally clean and the service and staff are te ##rri ##fic ! They gym is on the small side and if you stay on the 5th floor on the gym side , you may hear the t ##read ##mill ##s in your room but its not awful but any means ( if you like humming sounds ! ) W ##if ##i only available if you sign up for the reward program ( free ) . They say the w ##if ##i is slower this way but it seemed fine for me ( and I was working via a corporate VP ##N in my room ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Come to Chicago Blues Festival ; every year . Great location for any event downtown . The two bathroom rooms are great when traveling with Ladies . Hotel is clean and quiet . Quick access to trains and walking distance to moist everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We rented the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Suite and it didn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . It was spacious , quiet and clean . Staff at the hotel was very friendly and effective . J ##ac ##uz ##zi worked very well . View ##s were good . It ' s mere steps to the Lake and Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m from the UK and stayed recently for 3 days for work . Whilst the Hotel is average , great location and usual facilities for upper mid range , the service at the health club is what stood out . I don ' t normally write reviews but I ' m calling out Oscar and the other guy behind the desk ( Sorry , didn ' t get his name ) . I ' d checked out but wanted use gym one last time before long flight home . Oscar went above and beyond to look after my bags , offer me a water and generally make me feel like I was a special guest - I wasn ' t . I re ##ck ##on he is just one of those guys that is all about helping and doing a good job . I don ' t normally write reviews but promised myself to call him out . Thanks mate . UK could learn a lot from US Custom ##er service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really ? Even a Hilton Honors member is required to pay a $ 15 / day fee to use any of the weight machines or free weights . ( This is NO ##T a cheap hotel , either . ) As a frequent business travel ##er , I was extremely disappointed with this policy . It serves as a de ##ter ##rent to working out , that ’ s for sure . Yes , a guest can use the pool ( and do ##dge the children jumping and playing , which I did ) , or walk the track . But this is the first time , in decades of travel , that I ’ ve encountered a Hilton with this policy . I ’ ll definitely cross this hotel , and other Hilton ##s , off my list of preferred hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful place . . . . Super friendly staff . Did the American Girl special and the girls were excited with the doll beds , the cookies and the [UNK] . Did v ##alet parking which actually wasn ' t that much more than overnight parking in the self parking garage . Was worth not having to carry all of our stuff all over the parking garage ##s . We did walk to the American Girl store which was not real close , but if you walk on Rush street it is not as crowded as Michigan Avenue . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just returned from a short trip to Chicago . Room ##s at O ##m ##ni are suites with separate bed from sofa / lounge areas and two TV ##s . Location is ideal , right on Michigan Avenue and not far from river . Close to all major attractions and restaurants . Vale ##t staff are outstanding , friendly and very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Move ##d in for a week , , , hated to leave . I ##H ##G ’ s Intercontinental brand delivers . . . location is perfectly situated between the river and the lake . I was upgraded to a suite ( hell yeah [UNK] ) that was extremely comfortable and offered an excellent city view . Staff and amenities were first class . . . . . they just recently began a bicycle loan ##er program , , , what a great idea , I enjoyed riding along Lake Michigan . I highly recommend this property , thank you [UNK] . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is in the downtown area near Grant Park . It is an historic hotel , full of stories and opportunities . There are restaurants , bars and shops in the hotel , and the service is great . The rooms are clean , comfortable and spacious . They only improvement I would suggest is there was no drawer space for clothes , which I found odd . We had a great time and would recommend this hotel for a stay in Chicago , an event or show . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful breakfast b ##uff ##et . Great cocktail ##s , view , and staff at the Big Bar overlooking the river . Clean rooms with many places to enjoy conversations or working on a laptop throughout the second floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to stay ! Modern , clean and friendly ! Perfect for 5 day break in a great location . If you love shopping . This is perfect location to shops and mall ##s . The bed was so comfortable which is unusual , will definitely come back again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is fantastic as well as the overall architecture . A great historic landmark . The location is excellent . The rooms are pretty dated , with wall ##paper p ##eel ##ing off , carpet ##s pretty stained , and with the fire escape stairs right outside my window , blocking the entire view - and I ' m a Hilton Gold + member ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] There is information in the room regarding the amenities provided and the associated prices . Domestic beer is $ 7 . 00 ( according to the information in the room ) . I phone ##d the hotel and the total with tax is $ 7 . 97 per beer . I had two beers for a total of $ 15 . 94 . However , they charged my credit card for 4 beers at $ 9 + per beer . Rep ##eat ##ed attempts to re ##ct ##ify ( all you can do is generate an email from their web - site ) to no avail . SC ##AM AR ##TI ##ST ##S ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family had a very nice stay . All staff was extremely friendly and helpful . The only downfall to the friendly service is that I wasn ' t sure who to tip and who not to . Room ##s were nice , but very small for the price I paid . Also , there was No room in the refrigerator due to all the food / beverage the hotel puts in there to try and make you buy - upset ##ting . We were in Chicago for a wedding , which had events at the hotel . I found parking else where , since I knew I wouldn ' t be moving my car & the hotel was too expensive . Overall , the pool and event rooms ( for the wedding parties ) were great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My friend came in for an art ##esi ##an show and we stayed here . It needs a d ##é ##cor update and total renovation . It ' s looking awful tired . Also there was a bit of black mold in between the pocket door and ceiling by the bathroom . Bed ##s were pretty com ##fy and linen ##s were decent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here from 1 / 10 to 1 / 13 . This is located right in the middle of all the tourist attractions . Walking distance to sky ##de ##ck , bean , art museum . We stayed on 22 . 22 / 23 are executive floors . You get larger room with two bathroom ##s . Express elevators . And breakfast and dinner at 23rd floor . Wow it was great . Extra cost was worth up ##grading to executive floors . My room faced north , had great view of the city sky ##line . Breakfast had eggs , o ##at ##me ##al , pan ##cakes and fresh fruit and yo ##gu ##rt . Dinner has meat ##balls , chicken with vegetables , las ##ag ##na . I would definitely return here again next time I ’ m in ch ##ica ##go [SEP]
0	[CLS] Best stay than I had at any hotel including W ##aldo ##rf As ##toria . I recommend Conrad in Chicago as the go to hotel for anyone looking for a hotel in Chicago . It is worth it . The rooms are spacious , comfortable , and the view is soothing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the reception desk were not welcoming at all . They didn ' t bother saying welcome when I told them we have travelled a long distance from Canada ! Both me and my friend felt like they don ' t like us the way they looked at us and talked to us ! The caretaker ##s were very nice though ! The toilet was not as clean as I expected . The bathroom door had some issues ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s - clean , excellent customer service with any and all staff , right on the river ##walk , easy walk or U ##ber to most places you would want to go Con ##s - wish they had an outdoor pool like Lo ##ews across the street , no newspaper available except to buy Great place for business and / or family travelers . Would stay here again . Mi ##s ##c . = If you want to hear some great music I recommend Blue Chicago and Kingston Mines ( Kingston is three miles away ) . For steak dinner and cool am ##bian ##ce I recommend St ##ets ##ons ( it is price ##y though ) . For most eclectic bar that you have to check out and have a craft cocktail - Broken Shake ##r . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sign ##ificant hotel . Fantastic location , amazing breakfast ##s with live cooking and great service , nice gym . Room ##s are small ##ish and worn out but everything is functional and you don ' t spend that much time in the room anyway , when you ' re on Ma ##g mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An affordable g ##em well located in Chicago . I was there for a meeting . The suite I had was very comfortable and very well appointed . I will return . The staff as very helpful . They have a very adequate pool and exercise room and a very good breakfast . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the location of this hotel from a booking stand ##point and also loved the amenities which included the rooftop lounge . Perfect for work or personal travel ! Once arriving in the room , loved it even more ! So spacious and I really loved the black ##out shades and lights all being on a central remote ! Great value for these types of amenities and upgrades with imp ##ec ##ca ##ble service and location ! Can ' t wait to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just stayed a couple of weeks ago on October 4th - 9th and I loved it . Kay at check in was awesome , she was very helpful and friendly . Mrs . Teresa Q ##uit ##o who cleaned my room every day was more than outstanding , she is been working there for 14 years and she talk about her job like if it was her first day . Another employee who is proud to work there is Kenny at front desk , I Ch ##ek out and he assisted me at 4 am and told me the History of the hotel . Next time I visit Chicago I will define ##til ##y stay at this great Hotel . Thanks for made me feel at home ! ! ! Me g ##ust ##a Co ##mp ##art ##ir [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are lovely , the service wonderful , and the extra ##s ( e . g . drinks and app ##eti ##zers each evening and continental breakfast in the morning ) a real convenience . For those who want a location convenient to everything downtown Chicago , this is a great place . We ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have visited Chicago every year over the past 40 years , and this is our favorite hotel ! ! The views from the rooms are great ; the staff is a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and professional ; and the house ##keeping is excellent . We L ##O ##VE this hotel . ( The Chicago Burger Company restaurant , though , is over ##p ##rice ##d and is a self - serve establishment . So sad . It did not used to be this way ! ! Now , we will go elsewhere , rather than this restaurant . Also , they have removed the nice , casual sofa seating and bar to the west of the Burger Company . It was so pleasant . ) All of the staff , from the front desk to the v ##alet ##s , to the servers in the club level lounge , to the parking attendant ##s were great . Love to go here ! ! ! Just not the Chicago Burger Company . De ##fin ##ite ##ly stay here , though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The All ##er ##gro is an older hotel in the theater district of Chicago . It has been kept up to date . The lobby area is very nice , large with a gas fire place on one end . Every evening the have social hour with complementary wine . Very nice . The main complaint is how small the rooms are . The room was just big enough for the king bed , a desk , and a dresser with a t ##v on it . The closet was not deep enough to hang your clothes . You had to put them in at an angle . Weird ! The bathroom was very small and I mean very small . All said and done , what with all the great hotels in Chicago , I ' m not sure I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 2 nights . It was walking distance to Navy Pier , Millennium Park , Art institute of Chicago , River Walk , etc . The Hotel is beautiful . Staff is very friendly and helpful . Meeting rooms were spacious with great sound and projection services . Food was delicious and p ##lent ##iful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] its a g ##rt landmark in itself , easy task for the commuter ##s - however hotel need to kind of re - fur ##nish , its not like any other modern hotel i visit . you don ' t have coffee / tea available in your room & sometimes the AC duct gives up , or at least gave up in the room i had stayed this week [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at H ##ya ##tt in August , the hotel was really nice in a great location , good service and the staff really helpful , they put in our room a refrigerator to put my dad insulin ##e medicine with no extra charge . The hotel is located across the street from Chicago River and two blocks from G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s Pizza . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The best thing about the stay was pulling up and being greeted by v ##alet . It was all down hill from there . Check in process was horrible , the pool was over ##crow ##ded , in room mini bar was extremely expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , a solid hotel . Nice rooms , good amenities and fairly priced . I especially like that they have a round - the - clock market in the lobby , as this made it easier for getting food / coffee no matter when I was leaving or returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful location . Full size Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby . Re ##quest ##ed and received early check in with elite status . Was informed that we had been upgraded - ya ##y ! ! ! ! ! Who doesn ’ t like to hear that ? Room was clean , nicely sized ( 2 q beds ) with separate tub / shower . H ##OW ##E ##VE ##R , the window was ins ##et into the wall so deeply and so small it basically overlooked rooms across from dead space . Our stay was We ##d - Fr ##i with people just starting to feel comfortable about returning to the city - so hotel not full . The point is I ’ d have been happy with the room if they hadn ’ t mi ##sle ##d us with the whole ‘ upgrade ’ conversation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is large , clean , well - fur ##bish ##ed . The staff were friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The only grip ##e I have is that it felt like I was being nickel and dim ##ed for everything . First , the cafe at the hotel was insane ##ly expensive . Then , the W ##if ##i cost approximately $ 15 / day to use . On top of that , if you needed a refrigerator ( which I did to store my son ' s milk ) , you had to request one . The refrigerator ##s were stock ##ed to the br ##im with items for purchase and were not cold enough to store medical supplies . I know that hotels are a business , but they do not have to make they end ##eavor ##s so obvious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the Chicago Mill ##eni ##um location for a business trip . I was serviced my Man ##dan ##a in the President ' s Club . She was THE best . She greeted me daily and remembered my ' special ' order . She truly ex ##em ##p ##li ##fies 5 star service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay at the She ##rato ##n about once a year . I review this hotel ever few years just to give a current perspective . I could actually cut and paste my glowing review from three years ago , or even three years before that . The rooms , that staff , the location , the hotel , the food are all top notch . The views from the rooms are wonderful , the beds very com ##fy , house ##keeping always seem to want to he ##p and meet my needs . . . a home a ##wy ##a from home as far as I ' m concerned . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Rush St , and the hotel is great too . Well thought out , nice amenities , clean nice rooms with good views , efficient staff and check in and out . The restaurant is also nice and great c ##rois ##san ##ts . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for the weekend . Couldn ’ t ask for a better location . Everything is a short walk away . Hotel staff were A1 . Very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting .

It was our first time to visit and we will definitely be back ! ! ! Thank you for making our mini vacation memorable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff was friendly , room was clean , lobby clean and well lit , and it ’ s a great location . The bed was also comfortable . Only giving it 4 instead of 5 because , as others have said , some things are worn and need up ##dating . Also , in our king bed room the bathroom was literally next to the bed , separated by a sliding door , with the toilet right next to the door inside . It was a nice bathroom , but made it difficult to get up and use it without waking anyone . And if you have bathroom privacy issues and are sharing the king room , it ’ s good info to know . ; ) [SEP]

0	[CLS] My wife and I were in town for a wedding and we chose to stay at the Conrad primarily for the location . It was extremely convenient to get around the attractions on the magnificent mile . The rooms were surprisingly larger than we expected and very well furnished . De ##fin ##ite ##ly use the chance to so ##ak in the view at their rooftop bar / su ##shi restaurant . Their food is also quite a treat ; breakfast was our favourite . Our only wish is that they offered bottles of water in the room given how hot the summer is . Other than that it was a display of effort ##less hospitality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great for restaurants , shopping and being a local . Close to the lake . Warm , ho ##sp ##ita ##ble , great coffee bar in the morning and drinks bar in the evening . The staff is very friendly and helpful . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Chicago Hilton for the AS ##FA meeting . staff very he ##lf ##ul ##h , accommodation ##s excellent . Meeting was f ##abulous . Some sites close enough to walk to so made the experience enjoyable . Art m ##use ##am and navy peer close . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bad Management , no house ##keeping service provided if not call for it ! Guest are supposed to have house ##keeping service at the 3 r ##d day of staying , well on my 4 th day I had my service and because I complaint . The guy who checked me out told me that my luggage couldn ’ t be safe because they had no Bell ##men service and if I decided to leave my luggage was going to be under my own risk . So I would not recommend this property ! Management needs to learn how to do it ’ s Job ! And anti ##ci ##pating guest NE ##ED ##S . ( Rest ##rooms at the lobby were disgusting ( No hand soap , no paper , and all dirty ) [UNK] this was my first bad impression . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and I spent a weekend holiday shopping and stayed at the Palmer House . We thoroughly enjoyed our visit . The Palmer House is such a grand and beautiful hotel . And at the holidays it spark ##les even more than usual . Absolutely gorgeous . Our room ( 2 double beds , 2 bathroom ##s ) was perfect . The beds and pillows were heavenly . The only complaint I have was that something seemed to be wrong with the the ##rm ##ost ##at and it was very hot in our room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and love staying here were we spend the night in the city . The atmosphere is very nice and the makes you feel Welcome . The rooms are very nice . Try to get one with a river view . It is worth paying for the upgrade . We will miss Dan our friend behind the bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was the smallest hotel room I have stayed in in recent memory and that includes small local hotels all over Europe . The bathroom needed some attention with a badly din ##ged up sink surround and serious p ##eel ##ing paint on the door and wall . Need ##s some care and careful attention . I have to say that the staff was friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , helpful , and efficient . . . they truly made the stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing worked , charged to have U ##TE ##NS ##IL ##S delivered to my room , internet was only free because my conference provided it . . . . un ##be ##ara ##bly H ##OT in the room even though it marked 18 * c . . . . staff extremely impatient and rude [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had to make a quick overnight trip to Chicago for passport purposes , wound up at the So ##fit ##el by chance through a booking website . . . was a great stay : great location , superb service ( even when a ##rri ##vi ##g at 2 : 30 ##am after viewing the eclipse in southern Illinois ) , super clean room and a great bathroom . G ##RE ##AT view of the city too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent one Saturday night in town for BT ##S concert . Hotel was very crowded with concert go ##ers , wedding and NBA draft . Crow ##d was well managed . Lots of staff . We had booked an Executive level floor , web site said lounge with evening drinks and app ##eti ##zers and compliment ##ary morning breakfast in lounge . There is no lounge . Would it be so hard to remove this misleading info from the description of amenities on the website ? There was an excellent Sunday B ##runch B ##uff ##et , price ##y , $ 29 , lots of options , custom o ##mel ##ettes , big sa ##usage ##s , m ##uff ##ins , o ##at ##me ##al and some cool Asian dishes like pork b ##uns and a rice dish plus fruit and well , lots more . The room was clean , beds were comfortable , appreciated the black ##out curtains . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is helpful and friendly , E ##SP ##EC ##IA ##LL ##Y Man ##dan ##a at the Gold Lounge . The Gold team sent to our room a beautiful plate of chocolate covered straw ##berries with the words " Happy Anniversary " written in chocolate on the plate . This very special treat was accompanied by a bottle of Champagne ! Our room had a good view of the lake and Y ##A ##Y - - - Opera ##ble Windows ! So nice to get some fresh air in a high rise hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice check in lady and the room was so well put together ! We had a view over the city cross section and could see the Chicago River - it was gorgeous . In the morning they serviced coffee and even had I ##CE ##D ! I know that ' s small , but that ' s not something I ' ve experienced often when traveling . I would love to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Stay - enjoyed the room and the location was amazing . Got a great deal and would definitely look to stay there again next year . Restaurant was very nice as well - food was very good . Guy who took our bags to our room was very pleasant and had a welcoming personality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Such a great value for the $ $ $ . Above average E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING . Room amenities , check - in / out process , quick breakfast ( sandwich & coffee for $ 8 ? ! ! ) staff - what could be better ? The VI ##E ##W . . . amazing . We needed a place to stay on our way back through town and chose this property again . We were not disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Co ##m ##fy and quiet ! Room was just perfect . Just the right size room for a business travel ##er . Quality bed and bed ##ding . The shower was certainly not low flow which made for a wonderful shower each morning and night . I ' ll definitely consider this when I ' m back in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in July 2017 for business and really enjoyed it . The Ken ##zie is a small bout ##ique hotel close to the Me ##rch ##and ##ise Mart so we could walk back and forth each day . The location is perfect for seeing all of the sights in Downtown Chicago . We also really enjoyed the compliment ##ary breakfast ( located on each floor next to elevators ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Could not check in at 5 ##PM . When I checked in at 7 ##PM could not get my luggage . An other 20 minutes of waiting and more frustration . To top it all off no lounge access for Diamond a ##cco ##r member . They really do everything possible to not make you feel welcome . Maybe its because I ##m not from USA so they look down on me . My conclusion please avoid this hotel by any means ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton Palmer House represents a legacy of history in Chicago ! A great place to stay , comfortable , clean , and a lot to explore and enjoy with this hotel . The cathedral ceilings are a must see in the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] when we arrived there was only one person working the reception desk . this took to long . my i arrived my room i received an email with in minutes asking about my service so far . I explained what was happening . i received a call from manager , asked what he could do , i said not much i ' m staying on points , he said how about a couple drink v ##ou ##chers i said perfect . It was the immediate email when i arrived to my room and the immediate response that turned this around [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great time ! Our first time to Chicago and I couldn ' t have chosen a better hotel ! The staff was super friendly and helpful , I L ##O ##VE ##D the de ##cor of the hotel , there is a yoga mat in every room , free coffee every morning , free happy hour every evening . . . what ' s not to love ! It ' s central ##ly located to everything ! ! I would definitely stay here again ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has no business serving customers : - Food delivery cannot be delivered to the door , guests have to go down to the lobby - Micro ##wave charge $ 20 . Other hotels provide compliment ##ary microwave ##s ! - Hotel staff are very absent - minded and bad attitude . Restaurant servers got the order wrong , front desk has a bad attitude and told me star ##bu ##cks was 3 - 4 min walk turns out to be 11 min [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel ( what I guess you ’ d consider the lobby ) is really just a bar with a check in area is very very beautiful . However the bathroom in the room was very cramped and there was very little counter space . The toilet paper is literal behind you next to the back of the toilet . The sink , while probably not a probably for most ( but when you ’ re 5 ’ 3 ) I could barely reach the handles . I had a king bed but the t ##v was so far in the corner it was awkward to watch so I never even turned it on . And keep in mind I had the nice room than my co - worker apparently . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A very nice stay in June of 2016 . Not over the top luxury but very friendly staff and well maintained facilities . Very convenient location for transportation and downtown attractions . One mark of a quality establishment is how they handle an adverse situation or customer service issue . Although we had pre - paid for the room via S ##WA vacation ##s , we were presented with an in ##vo ##ice upon check ##out for the cost of the room . The clerk could not have been more pleasant and helpful about re ##ct ##ifying the situation . There are many choices in Chicago , and its worth it to try many places , but you will be satisfied and enjoy a stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , friendly staff , delicious food . Love the incredibly room ##y suite and bathroom . You have a huge selection of hotels in Chicago , but I would definitely recommend the O ##m ##ni for both business and personal trips . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I went to the Talbot Hotel for business . All the staff are very professional and friendly . The lady working at the front desk was a sweet heart . I would recommend any one who is staying the Chicago area to stay here [SEP]

The staff was extremely helpful and informing about the area . Will definitely be back . . . Thank you for making our first Chicago visit an enjoyable experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed here 4 times ( once a year ) and each time has been amazing . Can ' t say enough about how clean it is and how welcomed you feel . The team at Fair ##mont Chicago is friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , at ##ten ##tive . . . they really want to make sure you ' re enjoying your stay . 2 of the team really need shout - outs . . . Moe who is a day - time server at the Columbus Ta ##p Room ( the restaurant in the Hotel ) and has one of the best personalities ever and customer service skills that are imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . . . and Walt , a server on their Events / Conference team , just a great guy who year after year makes sure everyone has what they need ! We usually stay for 6 - 7 days and the maid ##s taking care of our rooms are always great at making sure we have what we need and keeping everything neat and t ##idy ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff & service at the Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park were both O ##UT ##ST ##AN ##DI ##NG ! Sharon H . { & the entire staff in the Gold Club } went out of her way to make our stay very enjoyable . She was very helpful & persona ##ble . We will be back ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed into one of the worst rooms I ’ ve seen in a while . . . This room looks like a motel 6 room . Front desk unable to get us a better room but hopefully will tomorrow . At this point , would not recommend staying here . Wish I had booked any other hotel in Chicago . Ce ##iling has water damage and is very low . Small windows and tiny bathroom - doesn ’ t even fit a soap dish on the sink . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , at the north end of the loop and the beginning of the ma ##g mile and north side . Room ##s very nice and clean , helpful and friendly staff . Would have liked if they offered a better continental breakfast for its guests . Overall a great place to stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 2 nights at the O ##m ##ni Chicago Hotel . The rooms are spacious and very comfortable . The location was great ! We were able to shop along Michigan Avenue without having to drive anywhere . The restaurant and bar in the hotel are also great ! We had a very enjoyable stay and will be returning . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Place To Stay Li ##teral ##ly A Block For The Ma ##g Mile And The View Is Beautiful From The Room . . And The Restaurant Great Service And Place To Re ##lax And Have A Dr ##ink . . I Am Re ##com ##men ##d It To Any ##more Who Comes To Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Modern and comfortable hotel in the mid ##town . Very good service . Room ##s have just the right space but they are very clean and functional with an especially comfortable bed . Food quality could be improved in terms of variety . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 4 nights . Great location , friendly staff and very clean comfortable room . The breakfast package is worth purchasing . There is a nice bar located in the lobby area . Outdoor seating is also available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly staff . Extreme ##ly helpful always smiling . It ’ s a bout ##ique hotel , rooms were very clean , everyone was always willing to offer help , ask if we needed anything , beds were com ##fy . I had 2 kids and never were they annoyed from them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is really convenient to all the tourist ##y activities and central to the business district ( A ##on Center , etc . ) . The bed was really comfortable , and the staff was helpful . The restaurants were good , especially Craft Kitchen . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were looking for a great location , an excellent hotel , and super amenities such as breakfast , fitness center , & " cocktail hour " . We got all that and more . The con ##cier ##ge had exceptional suggestions for meals , entertainment , and travel . Location was convenient to trains and Union Station . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the All ##egro hotel for a business trip . Those at the front desk were very polite and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting upon check in . I stayed on an upper level floor , no view . The L train was right outside my window but at night you could not hear it . The rooms are very art de ##co in style and are rather small . The closet is a stand alone and it is very small . The bathroom is average size , very modern and clean . There are no coffee makers in the room , but you can ask for one and they will bring it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel near lots of great attractions ( walking distance to Navy Pier and parks ) . Lots of great restaurants right outside the door . Room ##s were clean and comfortable . Cat ##ered food was delicious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This charming , historic hotel has modern rooms and a nice restaurant . Most of all it is superb ##ly located at the North end of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It is just across from the Hancock building ( the 96 ##th floor is a must for drinks ) , steps from Water Tower for shopping and a short walk to the beach . Check out Group ##on or the hotel ' s website for some last minute deals ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice property convenient ##ly located . The staff is very at ##ten ##tive from the moment you check in until you leave . Everyone had a smile on their face and really seemed to care . Great recommendations on restaurants and things to do . They provide morning beverages and the bartender ##s h ##ust ##le in the evenings at the bar . Walking distance to House of blues , Hard Rock , river walk and several other sites . The only down ##er is the $ 65 parking fee . We rented a car upon leaving and used L ##y ##ft for all of the distant locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at The O ##m ##ni while in town to see the N ##D - Michigan football game . Great place to stay with the family and a prime location for shopping . Maybe pier was very close and the restaurant in the hotel was great also ! The breakfast was especially good ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ m going to start and end this review by saying : Stephan is the best . Seriously . I love this hotel . I love the people here . I love the food here . And I am a super super fan of Stephan . His personality is awesome and he truly cared . Thank you ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] After a long day and struggle to get downtown Leah and Nick made my day when I checked in ! ! Wonderful smiles and warm welcome . The compliment ##ary champagne was a bonus ! ! Room is decent size for Chicago and everything was clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The previous Conrad by North ##bridge was our favorite place to stay in down town Chicago . We were disappointed when it changed hands . We were excited to find out there was a new Conrad near the Mile . We spent two nights in mid Aug and thoroughly enjoyed it . The wide screen TV was awesome ! The location is perfect , the beds are comfortable and the bathroom is spacious . We will definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Heart of downtown Chicago and close to all major tourist attraction . Easy to get to from O ' Hare airport via the blue line subway or U ##ber / Tax ##i . Great restaurant ( Potter ##s ) for breakfast . Try and get the breakfast upgrade with the room package . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Compared to some of the other higher end hotels it offers great value for the quality of the hotel . Steps from Michigan Avenue at the north end with great access to both shopping and the lake front . Love ##d that they didn ' t push their services when greeted upon arrival but where eager to help when called upon . Hotel staff were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a week for a conference . It is in a great downtown location so super convenient if you need to be in town . As a conference hotel it is super busy and not personal ##ised , the foyer is busy and the staff who do a good job do so with such high volumes it lacks personal ##ised attention . Breakfast average and tired and needs a renovation . Room ##s ok , small and not well cleaned or maintained by staff . One item was left on the floor by my bed for the whole stay and not shifted or re ##position ##ed as it should have been . W ##if ##i is good and free for Star ##wood members . Club upstairs is busy and the selection is at best average and the coffee of so good . Overall you get an ok experience although not one I would recommend for a personal trip vs a conference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A nice location , nice view . Sub par room de ##cor and amenities and dated furniture . First impression is not a Wow ! The Wow ! comes later when you look at the window , and see downtown area . Sky ##line Suite - Need urgent updates . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Staff are very friendly , helpful & available . They made our stay even more enjoyable . We were a family of 4 , 2 adults 2 kids . The room was 2 double beds . Wish they had 2 queen size , only complaint . Otherwise , great room with plenty of space . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Perfect location , friendly front desk people , amazing bath products ! I have loved my stays at the Fair ##mont Chicago , both for work as well as vacation . Love that it is close to Millennium Park , and the shops and the restaurants , and you can pretty much walk everywhere . Their guest rooms are typically larger too , so fits a family of four comfortably ! And if you are on the look ##out , you can find pretty decent deals as well ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great atmosphere , beautifully decorated and very comfortable lounge and bar area . The outside patio was great and best decorated as well . They allow dogs on the patio which was great . Very European feel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this bout ##ique hotel in one of the best locations in Chicago ! 3rd time there this year ! Great get ##away from the suburbs and would stay here again and again . All the staff very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , professional and extremely helpful . An added bonus to have happy hour available and love the breakfast b ##uff ##et on each floor ! Very convenient and nice variety to pick from . It is so nice to walk out of your room and be able to get a cup of coffee on same floor ! Thank you everyone ! Sorry I didn ' t get names this time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here in February for a long weekend . We really liked the location just in the middle of the theatre district but it was close to all the attractions . The room was small but we new this before we stayed and if we had stayed longer it would have become an issue but for the four days it was fine . The room was clean , the beds were comfortable and the hotel bar was a good place to get a late drink . The front desk staff were all very helpful and full of great tips and only to happy to help us with having a late check ##out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We just stayed at the Ambassador and had a great experience with this hotel . We were traveling with our 2 young kids and had a 1 bedroom suite . This was a great choice and affordable for anyone traveling with kids because the bedroom had a separate door from the living room and a huge walk in closet . This is an awesome location to the water and restaurants and access to the train . Thanks for a really nice time and we will for sure be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for bus ##sin ##ess trip in Chicago . Central ##ly located near all shops . Room ##s are spacious , clean and modern . I had a suite which I recommend . I would return with my family . Bath ##rooms are beautiful . This is great hotel to stay for bus ##s ##ness or to relax in the city [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always choose the O ##m ##ni when visiting Chicago . Location can ’ t be beat for shopping , catching a Cubs game , or just checking out the fine restaurants in the neighborhood . The employees are always smiling , greeting you and are eager to make your stay the best . Note : contact the hotel directly by phone or website . Price ##line will charge you more ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago has an excellent location downtown . I have stayed here multiple times and will continue to when visiting again . Staff is very helpful with any problems . High ##ly recommend to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great place to stay if going to the Cadillac or ne ##der ##lander theatres . The common areas are beautifully decorated with a nice bar just a few steps away . My only knock is the rooms are pretty small , but it I an old place . Will be back for dear Evan ha ##nse ##n [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not the best customer service . Just doing their job , well kinda . Nothing special . Not going out of their way to ensure a great stay . Bell ##man Great ! Hair floating in tub . Front desk staff below average . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good business hotel . Had a nice and clean room . Excellent view from my room in the 34th floor . Breakfast was not included in my rate . For a European , they over ##do the Air ##con ##dition . It was too cold in the lobby and the restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the time we walked in , the staff was persona ##ble polite and helpful . I spoke with K ##wa ##me at the front desk who could not have been more a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! He helped us get a room that was best suited for our family and called us during lunch to let us know it was ready . I haven ' t been to the K ##B for over 15 years and I will not wait that long to return . Love ##d it then , love it now ! Had a great time and hated to leave ! Thank you ! [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel itself was beautiful . The elevator took a bit of getting used to . Service was excellent . A great view of the city from every window . Fitness center was well maintained and had lots of equipment to use , running routes provided . Conference room was well maintained and food excellent . Hotel bar did seem under ##sta ##ffed , but those there tried to make the evening as enjoyable as possible . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has just opened back up in the last month and it ’ s not running at full capacity yet . Yet they are doing an excellent job for customer service and cleaning . We stayed there at two different times in the same room . I was concerned that the room may not be as clean the second time as it was the first time . Since they had been shut down obviously all the rooms would be super clean . But you could not even tell us or anyone else and stayed in that room prior to being there . And it was the same exact room the second time we stayed in it so their house ##keeping is doing an excellent job their staff is just super friendly and willing to go out of their way for you even when they are still running short ##hand ##ed [SEP]
1	[CLS] While traveling with my wife for a business trip we were placed in a room with 2 double beds . . . when asked if we could have a king we were told we must upgrade . When we asked what made it an upgrade we were told that room would be on a higher floor , not much of an upgrade . The staff is friendly enough given they were only doing “ what they could . ” The room is nice . Great view . The dresser could have come from my college dorm in 99 . The bathroom was very nice . The pillows were awful . Thankfully Work covered the cost of the stay or else we would have left . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean , rooms have a lot space to relax with excellent service throughout the hotel . Location of hotel is in the heart of shopping and restaurants . They offer valued rates during peak events in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It has been well over a year since I last stayed at the Monaco , and what a great job the team did during these difficult CO ##VI ##D times . Ron at the front desk upgraded me to a suite ( I ' m Kim ##pton I ##C ) , and I spent much of my time perched in the window seats looking out over the river . The most impressive thing is that the hotel celebrated my recent promotion with flowers and b ##our ##bon in my room . These are the little things that keep me so loyal . Thanks to Ron , Adam G , and the whole team for another memorable stay . Can ' t wait to come back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I expected more from the Fair ##mont brand . However , the entire stay was problematic and even my final bill is un ##res ##ol ##ved . I do hope they will get my final bill corrected and item ##ized so that I may be properly re ##im ##bur ##sed for my business expenses . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This used to be my favorite hotel in Chicago , but no more . As a Hilton Gold member , the executive lounge was a te ##rri ##fic per ##k , as well as the beautiful views of the lake . But that has been eliminated . The service was just ok , the food was incredibly over ##p ##rice ##d , and there is no good reason to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place is pretty amazing , a very historic building . Our room was great , a big room with a nice modern bathroom and a closet . One word of caution , if they put you in a room on the west side , the train will sound like it runs right under your window . The area around the hotel is nice , my wife and I walked al ##ot . Never felt any concern for our safety . There are at least 4 small universities here , so the dining choices were not great . Most seemed to be geared to the college kids . If you order room service don ' t tip the waiter , he will have already added his generous tip to your ticket . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in 2 rooms during a visit to my brother in Chicago . One was a King , the other was two Queens . The hotel is huge , and has some amazing vintage details . Both rooms were comfortable and updated . We loved Kitty O ’ Shea ##s for breakfast and a night cap each night . Park ##ing was convenient , though definitely narrow parking spots due to the age ! The gym was fantastic . Great equipment , a track , and a pool . My only issue was the the ##rm ##ost ##at which seemed to set itself higher overnight . Overall great stay , fun history to the property , good service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to Chicago for a Anniversary get ##away . We really liked this hotel and location . The staff is super friendly too ! Everyone from the front desk , door ##men , v ##alet , house ##keeping and con ##cier ##ge were great . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was definitely one of the more p ##ric ##y places to stay . However service was amazing and breakfast was to die for . Our waiter that served our table was probably the best waiter i have ever met . Kind , caring and s ##nd quick . Would stay here again if rates were lower . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Overall the experience was good . We always love coming to Chicago and love the city . The room that we had was great all though we got a room facing the navy pier just or the fireworks where we couldn ' t see them from . I hope something can be done in the future or if there is anything that you guys could do for me that would be great as well . Thank you for your time and look f ##owa ##rd to hearing back from you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at The Talbot ##t Hotel for three - night weekend . Great location central to dining , shopping , parks , and culture . And a bout ##ique feel which lived up to the bill ##ing at a reasonable price point . Would certainly stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for a fancy wedding and stayed at the Intercontinental which is located on Michigan Ave near Illinois . Very close to the Water Tower Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile area and the Loop . The room was very spacious . The employees were very nice and helpful . We went to the Center Court restaurant for breakfast but did not make it to the Michael Jordan bar / restaurant . I did not go to the fitness floor but was told that the work ##out area na the pool were very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our first trip to us ##a was a disappointment , from the moment we stepped off the plane people were rude , hotel staff rude and un ##hel ##pf ##ul , no coffee facilities in room , no W ##i ##F ##i , room very small and dark , just found it unpleasant , extra hidden charges everywhere , will not return [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay in Chicago was that much more wonderful by having stayed at Fair ##mont Chicago . We came for a festival last year and when the festival announced it would be in Chicago again we didn ’ t hesitate to book again at the Fair ##mont . The staff is simply amazing . Mu ##gi , Man ##dan ##a , Ju ##ese and Sharon in the Gold Room lounge bend over backwards to ensure your stay is as amazing as possible . We hope that next year we once again get to stay here ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a clean , comfortable , friendly place . The staff was wonderful . We arrived early to Chicago & they were able to accommodate us in a room . We had an amazing city view . You can walk 10 - 15 min to Navy pier , millennium park and Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile or u ##ber for a few bucks . The city cancelled St Pat ##s parade & festivities due to Co ##vid - 19 but the hotel hosted a small party downstairs that kept us entertained & our son with games without leaving the hotel . I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a quick weekend at the Conrad . It was our first stay and we will definitely return . The room was very large , comfortable and had every modern am ##eni ##ty . The staff was friendly , helpful and made us feel welcome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff are brilliant and very helpful . Location is excellent and close to shops and restaurants . G ##ym is modern and has all the best machines . I stay here due to work once a month and loyalty scheme is definitely worth joining . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in the older style with an elegant lobby but , surprisingly for its age , the guest rooms are nice and large . It has good conference facilities , occupying the second through fifth floors . The cater ##ed meals were better than average for a hotel . The hotel is convenient ##ly located near many of Chicago ' s attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for the second time this past weekend and it was as good as the first time . Check ##ed in without issues on Saturday afternoon , we had a room on the 11th floor facing Michigan Ave . No issues with room clean ##liness , AC worked great since it was over 90 degrees this weekend . House ##keeping did a great job in cleaning our room . Looking forward to our next stay at the Conrad Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service is something that ' s in your DNA . It ' s a twin ##kle in your eye , a fire in the belly and a skip in your step . De ##met ##rie em ##bo ##dies that s ##pi ##rt . I appreciate the gentleman who handles the luggage 28 ##yr ##s ! [UNK] thank you both for taking good care of us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at this hotel two nights while in Chicago for a sporting event . We were on the 32nd floor , which offered very nice views of the city . The hotel was clean and the staff was nice and friendly . I especially want to compliment the Con ##cier ##ge Des ##k and Bell ##hop ##s for providing exceptional service . Room ##s were pretty standard - no complaints . I did not get a chance to try the restaurant or bar . They both seemed nice . There are so many amazing places to stay in Chicago , but I would definitely put the So ##fit ##el on the top of my list due to their at ##ten ##tive ##ness and hospitality . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We live in Chicago suburbs . Wanted a quick get ##away to celebrate our wedding anniversary . So decided to stay in the city . It ' s a really nice hotel with welcoming staff and co ##zy clean suites . The lady at the reception even offered a compliment ##ary wine when we told it was our anniversary . You can get some ##b ##B ##est views of the city from the room . Overall satisfactory stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I spent the weekend in Chicago . We booked a room with two doubles . The room was a nice size , and the bed linen ##s were great . Usually , the comfort ##ers are way too warm for me in the summer , but the She ##rato ##n provided a thinner than usual comfort ##er in addition to the usual one that makes me r ##oast . I ’ m all ##ergic to feather pillows , which were promptly replaced with h ##y ##po ##alle ##rgen ##ic pillows upon request . The hotel is located on the Chicago River , and the River ##walk is easily accessible on foot . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a well placed hotel , very near the lake and close to plenty of restaurants and shopping . We managed to get out and about even though we only had a very short time in Chicago . The hotel was comfortable and very clean . I loved the king bed and the linen ##s . The staff was very friendly and helpful . I would definitely stay there again . Oh , and there were coffee making facilities in the room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is our second time staying at the Hilton Chicago & we honestly love it . The hotel is gorgeous , very ch ##ic & s ##ty ##lish . My kids felt like they were walking into some place really fancy when we checked in . The rooms are clean , updated & spacious . The only " complaint " we had is how to handle parking isn ' t clearly marked - it was included with our room however no instructions were provided . It was simple once directed where to go . The hotel is close to Millennium Park as well as several delicious restaurants . There are always people to watch & the whole experience overall was wonderful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This place is perfectly located in Downtown Chicago . The exterior is a f ##abulous addition to the sky ##line . The inside is taste ##fully decorated and extremely C ##LE ##AN ! ! The crown jewel , though , is the Fitness Center on the 43 ##rd floor ! The views are breath ##taking , and the variety of equipment is awesome ! Will stay again when in Chicago ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for Thanksgiving . We had a beautiful view of Grant Park . The room was very clean , bed com ##fy , big clean bathroom . The staff was very court ##eous and professional . Room service was exceptional . Only one negative : there was a cold breeze coming from around the windows . We had to close the blind ##s and curtains to block the cold . . . so much for the view . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved our stay at this hotel . The room was enormous and so clean ! The staff is amazing . We really appreciated all the help that we were given as we didn ' t know our way around Chicago . D ##wayne was such a joy . He made us feel so welcome and gave many suggestions of places to visit throughout the city . He welcomed us every time we came back to the city and asked us what adventures we had for the day . He remembered our names as well . It just made you feel that everyone really cared about your happiness while you stayed in their hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel made the best of a bad situation during CO ##VI ##D . They took great care of me and my family during our 3 night stay . The fitness center , spa and pool were all open ( and f ##abulous ! ) during our stay . Even if you aren ' t a swimmer you owe it to yourself to check out the amazing tile work in the pool area . Great place to relax and read or even check email ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very convenient location to the trains , River Walk , and lots more . Our room was spacious and quiet . The bathroom was large but lacked sufficient shelf space for personal items . The front desk staff were very pleasant . We had breakfast at the restaurant and it was great . My only complaint was about the w ##if ##i . After signing up for the rewards program it was very confusing as to how to get the free w ##if ##i and get the other devices on it as well . I heard another guest in ##quire about it at the front desk and they were very helpful getting her on the w ##if ##i . Would definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago is convenient ##ly located in the heart of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The accommodation ##s are modern and luxurious . The beds are very comfortable . The bathroom ##s are large and well designed . We ' ll be coming back again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is welcoming ! If Nicole is not already employee of the year she needs to be AS ##AP . We are greeted with bright eyes and smiles underneath masks . The room has a beautiful view , desk to get work done , and a lo ##ung ##ing area . Swiss ##ô ##tel for the win ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of the nice ##r hotel experiences I have ever had . Great , at ##ten ##tive staff . After a rather horrible travel experience to Chicago they were te ##rri ##fica ##lly a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ( and calming ) upon arrival . Very clean rooms . Can ' t beat the location . Great bar in the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice hotel . I felt it was good size but compared to a lot of the others around , not to much . All of the staff that I talked to were very pleasant . The food was adequate . The room was very spacious and clean . It is located close to the downtown activity right on the river walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our trip started with amazing customer service upon check - in with Rose ##mar ##ie . She was professional , knowledge ##able and quick to get us checked in and to our gorgeous room . Tony was our server at breakfast each morning at Lock ##wood Restaurant on - site and he was very at ##ten ##tive and polite . Adam was the amazing bartender at the Lock ##wood Bar which is also on ##site . I was impressed with the service and professional ##ism of this entire stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room is just nice . Small but co ##zy . It has everything that we needed . Location is a bit far from downtown ch ##ica ##go but you can U ##ber everywhere . The hotel is pretty , it has its old world charm left to the building and the ballroom has magnificent design . The service was good . There ' s a nice jazz band playing at the lobby bar on f ##rida ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This q ##ua ##int hotel had it all , great door men in D ##wayne and Perry . They could answer any question you had , food was te ##rri ##fic , atmosphere was wonderful and location was perfect for our business meeting in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel lobby is comfortable . Good food in the restaurants . We enjoyed br ##unch and the Irish bar and restaurant . We visit frequently on weekends for breakfast or br ##unch . Like the view of Michigan Avenue and Grant Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently went to Chicago and chose the Swiss ##ote ##l near our Corporate offices . I arrived at the hotel after a long flight and was ready to slow down before heading our to Dinner . The staff at the front desk were very friendly and made sure I felt they were doing everything to make me feel welcome . They offered a list of local restaurants close by and even pointed me to the bar area with some specialty drinks . I got a great room with a view of the town and Lake Michigan . The room was a normal size room and it was in top shape when I arrived . Everything as in its place and the bed was very comfortable . The bathroom , while updated was rather small , but manage ##able . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were offered an upgrade from King room to King Suite for what we thought was a reasonable amount . We have stayed at Kim ##pton ##s in the past and were again pleased . Dog friendly which didn ' t bother us . We ' ll stay here again ! Nice job staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While staying at another hotel , I stopped by the Martin ##i Bar / Library room for afternoon tea . I ordered the Asian style and so loved it . The waiter , Mo ##ra was V ##ER ##Y at ##ten ##tive . I arrived without reservations , and the Director of Operations , Marcus , was kind enough to make sure I was able to have the opportunity to experience the tea . Since I was alone , I sat by the window and people watched as I sipped tea and just relaxed . I highly recommend a visit there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had the pleasure to hold our board meeting at the All ##egro Chicago , from the first contact to the final bill ##ing , everything was great . The Staff is very kind and welcoming . The meeting rooms are great . Cat ##ering is very good . The organisation of the meeting , catering , audio / visual , service was fl ##aw ##less . We most def ##ini ##tley will book another event at this location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed here a dozen or so times now . Over the last year or so , they have added an " am ##eni ##ty fee " . This added another $ 14 to my room rate , taxes , etc . When I first que ##ried why this was I was told it was for the use of internet , business center and other amenities and that I could get complementary coffee and bag ##els ( or , maybe , something else ) in the mornings up to 10 : 30 ##AM . I find this " am ##eni ##ty fee " dubious . Why not just charge those people who want to use those service for them , rather than adding them to the bill of all customers ? Or , they should simply price the extra services into the base room price . For a reasonably up - market hotel I ' m disappointed that they would nickel and dim ##e customers in this way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Over booked property . . . dirty . . dated . . . . fitness center too small for the size property . No noise buffer between rooms . . . called security for a party happening in a room next to ours it was after Lo ##lla ##pal ##oo ##za and there were at least 20 under ##aged kids drinking in the room . . . security never came never followed up . Ho ##rrible customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very nice . We had a Chicago Suite , and the room was huge , with a separate bedroom , living room with din ##ging table and huge TV screen . The sleep quality was the best of the last four hotels we have stayed in Chicago ' s near north side . There was a L ##OT of storage for clothing - very nice . Everything was clean , and the people were quite nice and helpful . We were able to request a shower chair ( such as for a hand ##ica ##p person . ) The restaurant Baptiste and Bo ##ttle was ok , and the rooftop bar and su ##shi place - No ##yan ##e - was delight ##ful on a sunny , br ##ee ##zy day . We would likely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for a birthday adventure . The hotel was great : L ##OC ##AT ##ION , am ##ment ##ies , etc . Every employee we encountered was polite and friendly . Just a heads - up : the provided toilet ##ries do have an “ old lady ” scent to them . I would stay there again in a heartbeat . Thank You ! ! ! for an awesome experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing location and great staff . For the price point , you get a huge suite . Perfect if you have a third person with you . The pool is under ##si ##zed so don ’ t worry about bringing your swim trunks . Bring sneak ##ers for all the amazing shops and restaurants within walking distance ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is beautiful and very lively . The Mexican restaurant was closed most of the time and the game area for the kids never had the games out when we were there . Other than that it was awesome . W ##E love that there ##s a 24 ##hr store / cafe that has quality food & a star ##bu ##cks drink menu ! We always stay at H ##ya ##tts ! They are the best ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay at this wonderful hotel ! From the friendly efficient front desk staff to the amazing waiter at the restaurant this hotel provided a warm welcome & excellent service ! Room was spacious with large windows and nice view , bathroom setup was really good , and the beds were wonderful ##ly comfortable ! I would stay here again and again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Don ' t get a room where there is a hotel ice maker . If you want a nice quiet v ##ibe in the restaurant / bar , this isn ' t your place . The room was clean and comfortable . Odd to have large bottles of s ##ham ##po ##o , condition ##er , body wash and body lot ##ion that is shared from one guest to the next ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay at this hotel several times a year . We always request 2 beds . This time we got a tiny room with 2 twin beds . We dealt with it . Next , I come to this hotel specifically to use their wonderful pool . It was under renovation ! I was so disappointed to arrive in My bathing suit to see it closed . No sign , no explanation . Nor was there anyone at the desk at the entrance to the fitness area . So I couldn ’ t in ##quire . Next , I was having trouble with our coffee ##maker and went down to tell the con ##cier ##ge . She was down right rude to me . I don ’ t know why we weren ’ t told that renovation was happening on the pool be ##ware if you are looking forward to using that great pool ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Alto ##ugh the rooms are quite expensive , had a great stay . Friendly staff , very helpful ##l . Food is very good ! ( alto ##ugh there is a lot to eat around . ) Room was very good and clean . Also cleaning during the week very accurate ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sub ##stand ##ard service in the front desk from Check - in to Check - out . Mi ##sle ##ading f ##olio ##s . Manager on duty was insulting , un ##p ##ro ##fe ##ssion ##al and unwilling to find solutions . I ended up wasting a lot of time in these interactions which interfere ##d with my business activities . The hotel overall is old and facilities / rooms need up ##dating . As an H ##H member I found this stay quite disappointing and way below the Hilton standards . I would not stay again in this Hilton when in Chicago and I would caution business travelers who do not have time to waste in un ##f ##ruit ##ful interactions with hotel staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hall ##ways looked worn out and smelled must ##y . Car ##pet looks like there was lots of water damage or just worn walking pattern . Ask ##ed staff for suggestions of places to eat since their restaurant was closed . Didn ' t have any suggestions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My three star rating isn ’ t suggesting this hotel is bad ; it ’ s a good central Chicago choice . The location is a particular bonus . The room we had was really big , huge walk in closet and quiet , I never heard corridor noise from other guests . It does lack some basic ##s : no free W ##i ##F ##i access . We were beg ##rud ##ging ##ly given an access code due to issues with valid ##ating a Hilton Honors account . No shower gel , we had to go buy some . No coffee machine in the room until we mentioned this in the t ##x ##t message feedback request ( which is an excellent idea and the hotel staff responded very quickly to our concerns on this ) . So , overall a good choice with some issues bringing my total rating down slightly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This H ##ya ##tt has a fantastic view of the city and river ##walk , if you are willing to pay a little extra ( worth it ! ) . Location is fantastic . It is central ##ly located to all the sites and great restaurants . The parking garage is right next to the hotel . The area felt very safe . The staff was excellent and helpful . We would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Visiting Chicago and decided to try the Kim ##pton Monaco . Great location in the heart of the city , near Morton ’ s , McCormick and Sc ##hm ##ick , and Star ##bu ##cks . Check in was speed ##y , with Ron mentioning the events and offerings that afternoon . Staff is professional and helpful and best of all , the rooms are spacious for big city hotels ! When we return to Chicago , the Kim ##pton Monaco will definitely be on our short list for places to stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for the Chicago Marathon , coming from Baltimore . Great location . Clean , friendly , staff was very helpful ! ! Got a nice tour on my run of the city . Nothing can compare to the H ##ya ##tt ! Thanks for a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I enjoyed our stay ##cation at the So ##fit ##el . Location is perfect if you want to be near the Ma ##g Mile area but in a quiet ##er area . The rooms are well appointed and the staff was helpful and friendly . Additionally , the gym was reasonably large and clean . We expect to return to the So ##fit ##el . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about the hotel was excellent . Service was ex ##em ##p ##lary and the rooms were fantastic . En ##joy ##able bar and restaurant with great views of the city . The location is perfect for enjoying the city and am looking forward to coming back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very helpful staff . Top tier all around . Check - in was quick and staff was extra ##ord ##ina ##rily nice . Room was clean . Only issue with room was that controlling temperature overnight was impossible . Clean ##ing staff was another plus as they were very nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l for my husband ' s first trip to Chicago and cannot recommend it highly enough ! The room was com ##fy and quiet . In particular , Melissa Baker the Con ##cier ##ge and Hugo in the lobby bar were extra ##ord ##ina ##rily . Melissa was patient , professional , and super helpful in recommend ##ing great things to do , with true inside ##r knowledge . Listen to her advice . She won ' t steer you wrong . Even a simple local breakfast place ( The Dr ##unk ##en Bean ) was del ##ish , special , and within walking distance . Hugo made the best Old Fashion ##ed cocktail we ' ve ever had ! Ever . He also was super friendly , professional , and helpful with local recommendations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel should spend money to re ##f ##resh some of their rooms . There were certain aspects that needed repair . The front end service was very slow . Too ##k almost 15 minutes to check in . Re ##ception should be better equipped to handle capacity . Historical building has some cool elements and the elevators are fast . Con ##ven ##ient to lake Michigan and other tourist attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First stay in Chicago and picked this hotel . Good location off Ma ##g Mile , close to shops , bars , restaurants . Easy walk to downtown core . Room ##s were a bit small but well laid out , clean , quiet . Hotel restaurant had a nice breakfast and coffee bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly helpful staff . Reno ##vated rooms and de ##cor and extra nice amenities ( bath products are Jon ##ath ##on Adler ) . Restaurant is open late and early - food is excellent . Sunday br ##unch for the family in semi private space was lovely - even though we had to keep s ##ho ##oing guests out of the space - folks thought the food in the open event space was for everyone ! Staff did there best to hold them at bay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just back from another wonderful weekend with our granddaughter ##s . So very impressed with Mr . John T ##iri ##til ##li ( our granddaughter ##s refer to Mr . T ##iri ##til ##li as “ Mr . John ” ) This is our third stay at this hotel . Mr . John always remembers us and our granddaughter ##s . The girls talk all year about Mr . John and when our next trip will be . They never want to stay anywhere else when we are in Chicago . She ##rato ##n Grand is V ##ER ##Y fortunate to have such a W ##ON ##DE ##R ##F ##U ##L man greeting guests . John & Beth - Ken ##osh ##a , W ##I [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to go to Chicago for NY ##E weekend and chose the O ##m ##ni due to a special on v ##alet parking ( saved $ 60 a night ) . We were certainly very happy with our decision ! The room was beautiful and very clean . The location was excellent as well ; despite the cold weather , we were able to walk to most of our destinations . We decided to order room service for breakfast on our first morning and that was a very pleasant surprise . The food was wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was was impressed with the at ##ten ##tive ##ness of the staff excluding one waitress . Overall the customer service was impressive . I would like to give an special acknowledge ##ment to Des ##k Clerk Tiffany . Your satisfaction was her goal . The facility was clean , but I must say I was a little disappointed with my room . It was a little dated . You have to request a refrigerator in your room s ##t an additional cost . Overall , I had a good experience . The hotel is also in a good location downtown . Many things are in walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff here is fantastic . I didn ’ t have a room booked for an extra night when my plans changed and they were able to accommodate me . Friendly and professional ! Great location ! Near the river and walking distance to magnificent mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was clean , very attractive and very comfortable . The staff were court ##eous and helpful . The gift shop was simply the best I ' ve ever seen . Great location and con ##cier ##ge service was tops . Hotel room service was better than most restaurants ! High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] To start our Route 66 adventure , myself and my partner spent two nights here in Chicago . When searching we found all hotels in Chicago to be quite price ##y and found this as one of the more reasonable priced options . The hotel is friendly , clean and convenient , within walking distance to all that the wind ##y city has to offer . Thank ##yo ##u She ##rato ##n Grand for a lovely stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I found every part of my two night stay at the Chicago Hilton awful . The worst part I brought this to the attention of numerous “ team members ” all of which brought no solutions . Cold loud room , coffee maker did not operate , when room service was closed you cannot read the menu . Room service was closed from 1 - 5 on Thanksgiving was forced to leave hotel for food . Message light on phone would not stop blinking , bed lump ##y , couch in suite was disgusting . Also , I am a Hilton Honors member and was not greeted as such . I love staying in historic hotels , and have stayed here several times prior , I will not be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for the first tie for a night . The rooms were small ##ish but well - appointed . Bed was super - comfortable and they had plug ##s right next to the bed - so charging electronics was super easy . The staff was super - friendly . There ' s a Star ##bu ##cks and a restaurant attached , both of which were great . Plus - if you ' re driving - it ' s a straight shot to 90 / 94 . W ##if ##i is free if you ' re a Kim ##pton member . . . but otherwise there seemed to be a charge . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently spent 2 nights at The Conrad Chicago and enjoyed every minute . The bathroom was large and the overall de ##cor was very modern . I wasn ' t a fan of the sofa , but this is a great hotel in a great location . It ' s extremely rare that I actually I enjoy spending time in my hotel room . After my long day on Michigan Ave . , I looked forward to returning to my room . The entire staff was helpful and friendly . They went above and beyond to make sure that everything was perfect . I am looking forward to my return this summer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We rented a suite at this hotel for a trip for 4 people . . . There was plenty of room , however with the suite we still only had 1 bathroom , and not nearly enough mirror space for getting ready . The bathroom is teen ##y , so be prepared for that ! We also were near an elevator and could ever word said as people walked by our door . Would definitely stay here again , would just make sure to not stay near an elevator . The location is the selling point for this hotel . You can walk to great shops and restaurants in an area of town not overrun by tourists . You feel like a local ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago is a beautiful hotel in a great location . The staff are friendly and helpful . The rooms are very clean and spacious . The bathroom was spot ##less and the shower had great pressure . We would definitely choose the hotel again in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I Stay ##ed at The Hotel Intercontinental for 3 nights for pleasure and I absolutely loved it . The front desk staff were professional and friendly . My room was clean , the beds extremely comfortable , amenities were rich and the mini bar had a great selection . Take the time to walk around the hotel . Its very unique and definitely check out the pool and fitness center for a truly unique experience . This hotel is perfectly located on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and is within an easy walk to the best that Chicago has to offer . The breakfast b ##uff ##et was great and offered a large variety . Star ##bu ##cks Is right off of the lobby which is an added plus . I H ##IG ##HL ##Y recommend The Hotel Intercontinental and can ’ t wait for my next visit as this will be my go to hotel for all my stays in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This definitely is a basic hotel - nothing ups ##cale but is an amazing bargain if you want to stay at a hotel near Miracle Mile , that has very functional , relatively large clean rooms ( that come with a kitchen ) . Hotel has a very friendly and very helpful staff , and a free breakfast . Bed ##s are very comfortable . Free w ##if ##i worked very well . Great for the business travel ##er on a budget and for the family traveling with kids . Lo ##bby is on the 6th floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , very friendly staff . It ’ s definitely not a cheap hotel , that ’ s ok . But charging $ 15 , 00 a day for W ##i ##F ##i in your room ? This is an acceptable policy for a low budget flight , not for a prominent hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is in a perfect location for exploring Chicago . You are right in the middle of everything . So many wonderful restaurants close by . Shopping all around you and the River Walk is a block away . The rooms are modern and very comfortable . My room was clean , quiet and quite room ##y for a city hotel . The breakfast was fine considering it is F ##RE ##E . How can people complain so much about something that ’ s F ##RE ##E . If you don ’ t like it , go out and eat . The gym was very nice . All of the staff were polite . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an appointment for Monday morning in Chicago and decided to go over Sunday for a show at Black Ensemble . We secured a room on - line . We were very pleased with Swiss ##hot ##el staff , location , lobby area eat ##ery , and clean ##liness . ( Front lobby L ##yne ##tte ( s ##p ? ) was a dynamic greet ##er who set the tone for the hotels hospitality . ) Only issue was having to take elevator to another floor for ice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Rouge Room at the Fair ##mont is old school elegant and beautiful . The cocktail ##s were delicious and the bartender ##s friendly . The food choices were extensive , very well displayed and easy to serve ones ##elf . P ##lent ##y of staff to clear away empty plates etc so no messy tables ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Chicago features O ##m ##ni ' s famous service in a building of under ##state ##d el ##egan ##ce . This has to be one of the best locations in the city . Right on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile on the corner of Michigan and Huron , the O ##m ##ni Chicago is convenient to everything the city has to offer . The hotel ' s 67 ##6 restaurant and bar features classic cuisine and co ##smopolitan cocktail ##s with 180 degree views of the city below . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely hotel , but try not to get a room on the west side of the building , which is about a block from the elevated train , which passes by every 2 - 3 minutes during the busiest parts of the day . It is slightly less frequent as it gets late , but it does run until late in the evening , and starts up again very early . I had ear ##p ##lug ##s in and a pillow over my head , and I could still hear it . And it woke us up every morning when it started running again somewhere around 5 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently my sister and I spent two nights at the Palmer House for our theater trip to Chicago . The classic design was charming . We were very please with our room which even had two bathroom ##s ! The service staff at the hotel was superb . For example , I had to use a wheelchair and they staff was excellent about helping us . One bell ##man actually took us the a nearby pharmacy when I had a medication issue to take care of . Whenever we had to go somewhere , the staff was pro ##mpt and helpful providing the wheelchair . In fact , on the day we went to the theater , the bell ##man actually pushed the chair down the street to the theater and brought us right to our seats ! It was very nice that my sister didn ' t have to do all the handling of the chair . We had a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gorge ##ous hotel & very well maintained for being so old ! Beautiful lobby area and extremely friendly staff . Standard rooms are small for a family of four if getting ready for a function , but love the old school charm ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I wanted a break from the usual b ##land international hotels and this one appeared to fit the bill . I was not disappointed . Clean , friendly , quiet and charming ##ly decorated . I ' m already booked in for my next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not up to par with hotels within a block of it . Way way over ##p ##rice ##d . No room service . Poor the ##rm ##ost ##at function . Staff is friendly but that only goes so far . The West ##in is down the block . I ' d recommend there over this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love my room even though yellow was not my color . I was able to work and relax . The room dark ##ening shades allowed me to catch up on rest . Staff was very helpful . I felt safe in my room . The space was just right . I loved the kitchen . The bathroom had a tub as well as a shower . It would be helpful to have a wash ##er and dry ##er on the premises . The Stay ##bridge has them . That is my only critique . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I forgot my notebook and i ##Pad somewhere in the hotel . Angelina the Risk Management Officer called me the next day and let me know that the hotel found my items and were holding them safely for me to pick them up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely hotel , in a great location . Just steps from Michigan Ave . Room ##s are well equipped , comfortable and clean . Staff is excellent . Would recommend the carpet in the room be replaced sooner than later . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I checked in for a mid - week stay . I had called prior and talked with Eric S . explaining that a special occasion was planned . He made us very like we were royalty ! Eric and the rest of the staff at this property are all amazing ! I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this Team and will be recommend ##ing to all my friends her in Cal ##i . Thanks Eric . . . . You R ##OC ##K ! [SEP]

At ##ta ##ched restaurant , Fi ##sk and Co , could use some improvement . The food was great , but the service was lacking . Pro ##s : - Recently updated - Great location - Hotel staff , including the door ##man , is really great - Room ##s are very clean Con ##s : - Had to remind waits ##ta ##ff that I ordered a drink twice and had to flag them down to get my check . This was during a late lunch at around 2 ##PM and I was one of four people in the restaurant . They were nice , but space ##y or occupied by other things . Regardless of restaurant experience , I would definitely come back again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a pleasure to spend a long weekend at the Intercontinental on Chicago ' s Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It ' s a f ##abulous property , in a great location and the staff is world - class . My family and I have stayed here many times , and will continue to do so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very much enjoyed this hotel and the location . Friendly staff and many restaurants and shops close by . High ##ly recommend to those who have never been to Chicago and want access ##ability to the city . Restaurant and bar are expensive so I highly recommend going to neighboring establishments . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love to stay in this hotel . If I could be pick ##y I would comment that I prefer the old de ##cor of the bar rather than the new . It ' s too bright and reminds me of an airport lounge . Service is always good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton All ##egro in a really good location in the Theatre District . The rate was quite high at the time but the hotel o ##oz ##es decade ##nce . The reception and bar are very class ##y . I was slightly disappointed at the room size for the price as was a small double but was very clean and comfortable . Unfortunately there was a house ##keeping strike on the whole time we were there but the remaining staff were very at ##ten ##tive if you needed anything . I would choose this hotel if I visited Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice friendly service personal . Management staff not so friendly , Diana . Wen ##t out first day at 8 : 30 ##am and came back at 4 ##pm and room not made up . Was told hotel full and not enough staff to do room everyday . I did request new towels , coffee , cups and water . Hilton hotel and they don ' t service the room daily ? Won ' t recommend although it ' s in a good location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You can almost imagine yourself as a character in a 1920 ' s novel as you walk into this dim ##ly , romantic ##ally lit hotel and venture up the staircase to the well appointed and sub ##tly g ##lam ##orous lobby . This feeling extends to the rooms , which resemble a jewel box for both their size and d ##é ##cor - - with lots of extra ##s and modern amenities ( bath ##robe , tall handled umbrella , yoga mat ) tucked in every no ##ok of the bathroom and closet . Not spacious , but a sweet landing spot after a day at work or a weekend spent exploring Chicago . The style of the hotel and the nearby theatre district almost beg you to don a se ##quin sheath and make your way down the staircase to meet star ##lets and da ##pper men dressed in white - tie for an evening on the town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . The room was perfect - clean , spacious , and comfortable . We stayed in a room with 2 double beds . Walking up and down the magnificent mile to get places was pleasant and if shopping is your main attraction then this is a perfect hotel . However , it was a bit far from many attractions , but for the price , definitely worth it . U ##ber is always an easy option for further attractions . It is a beautiful hotel with lots of older details that make it interesting as well . We would definitely consider staying here again our next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visit Chicago once a month to visit family . . . new grand ##ba ##by ! The service is friendly , professional and welcoming ! We ' ve stayed at over 30 hotels in Chicago . . . The Talbot ##t is our # 1 choice ! We ' ll see you on Sunday ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was excellent - con ##cier ##ge , bell ##men service was amazing ! We will definitely be back to the O ##m ##ni in Chicago ! Great location , clean , food great , friendly staff ! ! Re ##ceived a parking culture valued at $ 67 for v ##alet parking which was an excellent bonus ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Super ##b food ! Great service ! We had meetings with breakfast , lunch , and dinner and the food was great ! Not " hotel " food at all ! The room was super functional and the bed was just right . Overall great experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Worst Hilton I ’ ve ever stayed at . Room service failed to clean my room during my stay . Show ##er floor was filthy . Conference ##s rooms way over priced . No window , poor amenities and the probably the most expensive lunch sandwich I ’ ve ever come across . Re ##com ##men ##d you look elsewhere . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent hotel ! Right when I arrived in my cab the bell ##hop was already there helping me out . As I walked in the f ##rag ##rance of the hotel was lovely ! Check ##ing in was easy and the lady answered all of my questions . As I was wondering around the premises anyone that worked there offered their help . I ordered room service and the food was great and service was great too . I went to the restaurant and I was very ta ##sty and such a friendly server . The rooms were amazing ! So nice ! I loved this hotel . I will be back . I miss it already ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Du ##ane and Charles are the best . They always remember us and they are the best “ face ” of the hotel . They make us always wanting to come back because they are so persona ##ble . Have been staying at the Talbot ##t for the last 8 years . Won ’ t go anywhere else as long as it isn ’ t $ 600 [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Monaco for an Anniversary weekend . En ##joy ##ed every minute of our stay ! Very clean hotel , friendly staff , decent sized rooms for downtown Chicago . Had a River View room and the views of the river and surrounding buildings were awesome , especially at night . En ##joy ##ed the window seat as well ! Also the wine reception was nice although it was very crowded . Will definitely stay here again ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved my stay at the Fair ##mont in Chicago . My room was room ##y and perfect . I was just steps away from the Gold Lounge where I was always welcomed . The app ##eti ##zers in the evening were wonderful and could easily make a dinner . Breakfast in the lounge included eggs , bacon , lo ##x , bag ##els , yo ##gu ##rt and more . They even brought me freshly squeezed honey tan ##ger ##ine juice . Yu ##m ! I was at business meeting , so I didn ' t get to enjoy the amenities as much as I would have liked , but the staff treated me like Gold . Thank you so much ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our hotel room was very clean and we were always greeted by the front desk . It was V ##ER ##Y scary to have another guest given a key to our room and enter after 10 ##pm ! ! They were assigned to the same room as us ! ! When I called the front desk , they apologized and said it was human error ! ! That ’ s it ! AL ##WA ##Y ##S keep the door locked if you ’ re inside the room and hang the do not disturb sign on the outside of the door ! We also had a toilet issue where it wasn ’ t flush ##ing and re ##fill ##ing properly . After 3 days , we had to call for maintenance to snake out the toilet at 10 : 20 ##pm ! ! I would not recommend staying at this hotel due to an invasion of our privacy and toilet issues . There are many other hotels to choose from ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our second stay at the Ambassador . Historic property that has been renovated with attractive contemporary de ##cor . Live ##ly atmosphere with busy bar and large common gathering area . Great venue for wedding parties and other c ##ele ##bra ##tory get together ##s . Room ##s can be a bit small , but this stay we got an “ Access ##ible ” room that was larger and had an over - sized bathroom . It was quiet , down the hall at the end of the corridor and away from elevator traffic / noise . I would ask for such a room again . Would recommend to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is just perfect ! I enjoyed greatly the spacious room and nice interior . Hotel worked really well for business trip and I recommend also for vacation . Room ##s are quiet though you hear the traffic well when coming in . There are lot of nice restaurants in the neighborhood and shopping opportunities are only few blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean but very small room . . . . ( I suppose since I went th ##ru Price ##line I was given a big closet for a room ) . . . . The $ 15 / day Urban Am ##eni ##ty Fe ##e at check ##out was little more that price g ##au ##ging . . . . . Pa ##id $ 1 , 000 for 4 nights . . . . Too many choices in Chicago to think about returning here . . . . for that price point . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Despite the limited staff available due to Co ##vid there was no request denied , Considering the City wide restaurant ban on indoor dining they manage to run a very effective and quick room service option . . . Well Done [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E ST ##AF ##F ( thanks to Vince , Hussein and the other bell ##men ) and perfect rooms ! En ##joy the Art Dec ##o 12th floor pool and the perfect local ! You can get to all the best Chi - town locations from this awesome hotel ! [SEP]

1	[CLS] We visited Chicago while checking out colleges for our son and I booked the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel from an online site . The location was absolutely f ##abulous and the amenities were all above average . We loved everything about this hotel and I even consider the high price as being well worth it . . . considering the location and what you get . I highly recommend this hotel when visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was set up very nicely , clean and easy to negotiate . I liked that it was in walking distance to boat tour , Navy Pier , other restaurants . I would suggest you do not drive however as parking is very expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great room ready for us upon our early arrival . Staff very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Location perfect . One block to N . Michigan Ma ##gni ##fication Mile and the restaurants on Rush street and half mile easy walk to the Chicago River ##front . Perfect place to s ##tro ##ll , din ##e or relax watching the boats . Beautiful bedroom with second sitting room and extra large bathroom . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary orange juice was a great start to the day . Room was quiet , bed was very comfortable allowing for a rest ##ful night sleep Am looking forward to another city and another O ##m ##ni Hotel in the near future . They do it right , [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stop ##ped off in Chicago and stayed for the um ##pt ##een ##th time at the Public . Very comfortable , great location and good food . Room ##s are good size and comfortable . The P ##ump Room remains reliable ad very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a few nights . . was upgraded to a suite with my Kim ##pton Re ##ward ##s which was super surprise and a beautiful room ! Spa ##cious , pretty , clean . . . dining / living room separated from the bedroom and bathroom by a door . . . very nice room . Bed was S ##O com ##fy , shades were very dark ##ening . . . Staff was helpful with directions , etc . Only thing that was not 100 % was that even with a do not disturb sign on the door , someone entered the room to deliver an in room am ##eni ##ty . While it was very nice to leave an am ##eni ##ty - the D ##ND sign was on the door . . . I was out of the room , and felt very uncomfortable that someone was in the room though I asked that they not be . Otherwise a very nice stay and a lovely hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Found hotel through Trip ##A ##d ##visor . Great location . Walking distance to many restaurants and Lake Michigan . Room was very nice . Re ##ception ##ist Natalie was extremely pleasant and helpful . Good experience . Will stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted for the first time and for my special 50th b ##day celebration . As we checked in , Rose ##mar ##ie Go ##na ##zal ##ez , gave an upgrade to our room , a couple of waters as well as upgrade to late check out since we didn ’ t catch our train until 6 : 00 the next day . I appreciated her gene ##ros ##ity to help make my “ special stay ” even better . Then , she had chocolate covered straw ##berries delivered to my room to top it off . W ##OW ! ! ! She was key to the best experience possible . We will return to this hotel and hope to see her again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a wonderful 5 days stay . All the employees from start to end made us feel welcome . We look forward to returning back . rooms are very clear and comfortable . The hotel location is very good and very close to the nice places and the coast [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 2 nights . Excellent service at the front desk especially from Ke ##enan . He took care of us and gave us a great room . We were early before check in and the hotel is tech sa ##v ##vy and texted us one hour later when our room was ready . The bell boys were excellent . We left our luggage with them during that time and on our last day there while we went out for breakfast . Bernard at the con ##cier ##ge desk was excellent ! Very helpful . The all ##er guys were all great out front . Hotel was very clean with friendly staff . We were right beside the elevator shaft but didn ’ t hear a thing al night . N ##eg ##ative ##s : - pool was green so we didn ’ t go in - coffee is $ 4 in the lobby City is beautiful . We rode the big bus getting on and off at different sites . Take U ##ber not cab ##s [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ' t say enough good . IF I had to com ##pal ##in , it would only be that they don ' t have ve ##nding machines w / the ice machine : ) - we had to make trip to the close by W ##al ##green ##s for cold drinks . Otherwise , Super great and friendly staff . Clean rooms . . . great stay ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was my first time ever being in the US for the Fourth of July celebrations , and myself and my girlfriend had the pleasure of visiting the beautiful Kim ##pton All ##egro Hotel for two nights . It is definitely one of the nice ##st hotels I ' ve ever stayed in - right from the service to the interior design , it is truly fl ##aw ##less . The beds are large and comfortable , the rooms are modern , spot ##lessly clean and are very spacious . In terms of location , it is also very difficult to beat as everything is so close - right in the hear of Chicago . On top of this , we got an excellent price for this top - standard hotel . Would strongly recommend for business , leisure , or for a couple ' s weekend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was right in the area we wanted close to the river and several nice rest ##ura ##tant and river cruise ##s stops . A few blocks from the Navy Pier and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . You got to do the night cruise it is beautiful and get to see the fireworks . then take the subway to go see the Cubs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff , room , and location all worked to make this a wonderful stay in Chicago . The staff found out that it was our anniversary and went above and beyond to ins ##ure a great stay for us . We will always stay at the So ##fit ##el when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice amenities and friendly staff . Very close to nice restaurants and the Magic Mile . No restaurant on - site , but a great pub right next door . You are also close to State Street . Short walk to the river front . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel while attending a teaching conference at the end of November . The staff was very friendly and helpful . S ##hout ##out to the exceptional reception ##ist Nicole that welcomed me and upgraded a struggling teacher ' s experience . Eddie , at the bar was very kind . This hotel has beautiful views of the city and is very well located . I highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is small enough to be personal yet big enough ##t to have everything you need . With a view overlooking the Chicago river at one side and the Loop on the other side it is perfect for exploring the city as well as doing business . The staff is very helpful and next time we are sure to come back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall it was a comfortable stay . When I didn ’ t tip the v ##alet gentleman he treated me second class . Room was cold in the morning , poor water pressure and shower was like warm at best . Front desk staff was great bell ##hop was amazing as well . The bed and pillows were comfortable . Soap ##s lot ##ions and s ##ham ##po ##os were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] U ##gh ! I S ##O hate to give a Kim ##pton anything less than 4 or 5 stars ! My stay at Hotel Monaco was just not good . My room faced a parking garage . As a result , I woke up every hour on the hour because there was something going on in the parking garage . . . something loud ! It sounded like a trash truck visited every floor from 1 ##am - 5 ##am . I woke up and was exhausted for the entire next day . Also , the previous guest ' s socks were still under the couch in my room . Kind ##a e ##w . The room was nice and big , and service was good which is as expected with Kim ##pton ##s , but I would not stay at this property again . Sorry Kim ##pton ! I still love you though ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay here during our mini - moon ! The room was very nice . Wonderful bed , pillows could be better . We loved the rain shower but it was a little short for my 6 ’ 3 ” husband . We especially want to highlight how great D ##wayne is , the bell ##hop . He is a g ##em and we enjoyed talking with him . He gave us great marriage advice too ! Give him a raise and a large bonus ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The corner suite has an Amazing view . The staff are friendly and very at ##ten ##tive . We traveled with 2 children and the staff were very at ##ten ##tive to them as well . They were very happy with the ##i cookies and milk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best check in ever ! All employees very nice . Corner room exceptional . Hotel very elegant and ornate . Breakfast b ##uff ##et just ordinary . Great location to Michigan Avenue shopping and dining . Very nice experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family reserved two rooms on the Regency Club floor and the amenities and comfort and the Club Lounge were second to none ! We encourage those traveling for business or pleasure to consider Regency Club a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful experience . Great customer service and very clean hotel . Was close to parks and other downtown attractions and restaurants . Vale ##t parking was very easy to use and was able to retrieve items from car easily . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My date and I enjoyed our meal at the P ##ump Room and appreciated the intimate setting of the Library after the meal . I would stay again due to the location and the re ##saur ##ant . The room and bathroom were plain , but it was clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for the weekend and had an excellent stay . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds , great view of the city and excellent , helpful staff . Vale ##t is expensive but worth it . For four of us the two - bedroom suite was perfect . We will definitely be back next time we are in the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time in Chicago and glad we chose this hotel for our 4 night stay . We had a nice experience all around . The door ##men were very at ##ten ##tive and welcoming every time we came by . Check in was quick and Heidi was very professional and remembered our name if we came back for questions during our stay . We got a high floor room facing the river , which was a nice view . A special recognition to the club lounge associates Connie and Rene . . they are a huge asset to the company ! They were at ##ten ##tive , had a nice sense of humor , and super friendly and helpful ! One night we ordered warm milk for our baby and room service brought it by . . . we then noticed later on that it was on the house ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a Mediterranean Suite . A very spacious room with three window seats in the bedroom and another one in the living room area . Since we had a cold , wind ##y weekend , every warming up break at the hotel was spent in a window seat watching traffic , people , and the river . This hotel is just off Michigan Avenue and is within easy walking distance of many attractions in the loop area . When the rains start , transportation is easy to get . Probably the most noticeable difference about this hotel is the friendly and outstanding staff . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was fairly basic , but the service was okay and the rooms were of appropriate size . Many of the hotels in the metropolitan areas and just too c ##ram ##py , but I found the hotel room comfortable in size . The location was excellent . You are next to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and many other of Chicago ' s attractions . Note : I had free w ##if ##i , but I can ' t recall if this is due to my being a Star ##wood member . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would recommend Home ##wood Suite ##s for you next stay in Chicago . great location downtown , very comfortable Suite ##s and wonderful full breakfast and evening reception . High ##ly recommend this location . You on ##t be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had never been to a Kim ##pton hotel before . Wow , we were impressed . We stayed in one of the recently red ##one king bedrooms . Very nice . Clean , modern , attractive . Bath ##room was very nice though could have used more counter space and a couple more hooks for towels . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed , nice view of the river from our room . The service here was outstanding . The staff is super friendly and knows their stuff . Location is perfect . Also love the hosted wine hour . Nice touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff was amazing and the room was spot ##less . Wish I had tried the restaurants as well since they looked phenomena ##l . Location was close to the water and a number of great breakfast and dinner options . I won ’ t stay anywhere else in Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here with 3 kids over the Memorial Day weekend . The hotel has family suite options ( 2 double beds and a pull - out couch ) that was a good fit for our kids ( age 9 - 14 ) . The location can ' t be beat right on Michigan Avenue - easily walk ##able to Water ##tower Place , the tourist restaurant area of Illinois & Ohio etc . Close access to the ' L ' Red Line as well if you are going to a baseball game . They also left cookies and milk for our kids on our first night . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The en ##tree looks very attractive ; the elevators are efficient ; . . . but after entering the room the positive impressions come to an end . The hotel rooms might have been OK 30 - 40 years ago ##uti not any more now - so old fashioned ! ! ! Even no central light in the sleeping part of the room ; very poor bath / shower combination . W ##if ##i is only free if SP ##G member - and even then you have to go back to have this activated . If no SP ##G member it ' s quite expensive - as is breakfast : really ? ? ? ? For more than 300 USD per night for an old - fashioned room ? Luckily enough that the bed was ( very ) good . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : Wonderful Downtown location opposite Trump Hotel . Reason ##ably priced . Love ##ly , spacious , well - appointed room . Very friendly staff . Good restaurant . Con ##s : Pa ##id for river view but could barely see it . Small elevators . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The bathroom over ##flow ##ed twice in my room , i spoke to the manager seemed like he didn ##t care , he didn ##t do anything a ##bt it . Very rude when i was talking to him . I expected more from this location . I usually stay at the o ##m ##nis so far this was the worst [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at this hotel were un ##fa ##iling ##ly court ##eous and helpful , from the door ##men to the front desk and cleaning staff . Our room was comfortable and clean and although the carpet ##s in room and hall were a bit s ##hab ##by , that was a small detail . The bed and bed ##ding are very nice , the coffee machine well - stock ##ed and the room quiet . The location of the hotel is perfect : shopping and restaurants are walk ##able and entertainment reach ##able by cab or bus . We stayed 5 nights and will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I have stayed at the inter ##continent ##al on two occasions now . It ’ s perfectly located on Michigan Ave , priced reasonably , and the rooms are clean and modern . As a Star ##bu ##cks junk ##ie , I also particularly appreciate the Star ##bu ##cks located in the hotel - especially on a cold winter morning ! The staff have always been pleasant and professional and we experienced no issues at all during our stay . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got in very late on 1st day but made it to the bar for some app ##eti ##zers and a few drinks . Bart ##ender was great . Con ##cier ##ge and hotel staff was very helpful and had great recommendations ! Always love the free morning coffee and happy hour wine ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were staying here during my god - daughter ' s wedding and had a f ##abulous weekend . The location is perfect , the setting charming , and rooms were extremely comfortable . Very nice touches with wine tasting in the early evening and water or ice tea available with lemon ##s or lime ##s . The staff was very helpful and friendly , pointing us in the direction for lunch and breakfast ##s . One small g ##lit ##ch was that one of the elevators wasn ' t working and as all of us were leaving at once , there was a bit of a traffic jam ! We also signed up for K ##lim ##pton awards which allows free w ##i - fi . Initially , this wasn ' t taken off of our bill . As others have mentioned , the location is perfect . If you come to Chicago , don ' t miss the arch ##ec ##tura ##l river cruise ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Used for family holiday to Chicago , there was a problem with type of room booked , but was sorted out right away by manager , hotel is in good location for visiting downtown Chicago , very quiet , nice area , good room , would use again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location having an office in River North , great gym facilities including an amazing pool to treat jet la ##g and overall good rooms even if the standard can vary ( it always ho ##mo ##gen ##ous in the same price category ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The personality of the All ##egro is so re ##f ##reshing ! Michelle at the front desk was very thoughtful . She made our weekend even more memorable by sending sweet ##s and b ##ub ##bly to our upgraded room for my birthday . Don ' t forget to check out the new P ##el ##ton bike ! Thank you , Kim ##pton ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] After many consecutive stays in this hotel , always positive experiences , I was truly disappointed to have to wait for 2 hours ( from 14 : 00 to 16 : 00 , and still waiting ) for my room . Not nice to be welcomed back this way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a package with room and parking . En ##joy ##ed the higher level floor with view of Mill ##eni ##um Park . Re ##lax ##ing music was playing as we entered the room . Room was exceptionally large with a huge window . Coffee and tea were easy to make . Everyone was pleasant and helpful . Used the complementary bikes to bike on the lake shore trail . The cleaning staff was always willing to bring needed items that were requested . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great in the magnificent mile , close rest ##ura ##nts , supermarket and Chicago CT ##A Station . The Bad thing in this hotel . 1 - Not luxury like Other O ##m ##ni like in LA and Washington D ##c . 2 - No Spa in the hotel . 3 - I am Member in O ##m ##ni Hotel and when I booked by ex ##pe ##ida the send I will be V ##ip customer . But , they did not give me free bottle of water everyday or free drink or cake like other O ##m ##ni hotels . Also , the Pre ##mium is pre ##pa ##id while suppose to be free . The post ##ive in this hotel : 1 - Great view from my view . 2 - welcome and Fr ##ein ##dly staff . 3 - very clean Hotel . 4 - q ##uc ##ik check in and check out . 5 - Help ##ful con ##cier ##ge . 6 - cool room . 7 - I had a parking included package . I stayed 7 days from 16 - 23 July 2019 and my room was 251 ##8 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing stay - will be back ! R ##oof ##top restaurant was my favorite place to relax ; perfect location ; very com ##fy a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s ; easy walk to Michigan Ave or the River walk ; best customer service ! highly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would highly recommend the Conrad Chicago . The rooms are large . The bathroom ##s are modern . The service is exceptional . The staff is friendly . The location is perfect for shopping , dining and sights ##ee ##ing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] P ##rima ##rily as a business travel ##ler looking for good location , facilities etc . . this hotel is excellent . Once you ' ve spent some time in the hotel you also discover a little more of the history of the building and area - really interesting stuff in the context of downtown Chicago ' s story . Food always excellent in the main restaurant . Help ##ful , at ##ten ##tive staff ( as you would expect ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Swiss while in town for a large conference . I was super impressed with my room and even more impressed with the service provided by Eddie at Am ##use ! He ’ s a fantastic bartender who took care of me every night I was there — which was almost every night of my six night stay ! Thanks Eddie ! You ’ re awesome ! - Kristen [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was very pleased at our stay . The room was small but comfortable . Thought $ 6 was a lot for a bottle of water , but there are places close by to buy some . Valley was great while checking in . Location of the hotel is awesome ! Right off of Michigan Ave and all the best shopping . Was rain ##ing our last day and G ##eri , the girl behind the desk was able to find a small umbrella for me to use for a few minutes . She was very helpful ! Overall I would stay again and recommend to anyone looking in this area ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My friend and I stayed at this hotel in April 2019 . This hotel was facing to the magnificent mile and was very convenient . The hotel room was spacious and clean . However what I was impressed most was the quality of their service and willingness to help their customers . I will definitely stay this hotel again when I visit Chicago next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for one night for a family weekend get ##away . The property is well located and the room was very clean and large for a downtown city property . We were frustrated by having to call twice to get an extra pillow - taking over an hour - and no welcome am ##eni ##ty offered as S ##pire Elite . We would stay again , but it feels like the property is using CO ##VI ##D as an excuse to cut staff to the bone . P ##lent ##y of folks were staying there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came for a training and left with a smile . The training was great . The amenities made the training even better . It was great to hit the gym at 6 a . m . then shower and go to 720 for breakfast . It was lovely to end the day with fellow train ##ees beside the pool . The staff at the desk on entry was top notch and very con ##gen ##ial . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I began the day with breakfast brought to the room . When I finished I put the tray outside in the hall , as is customary , and called Room Service to advise the tray could be collected , When I returned 12 hours later , the tray was still sitting there , and the housekeeper ##s had evidently just walked past it all day . Very disappointing . The room itself was showing it ' s age and , strangely , there was no light fixture attached to the switch by the door so returning after dark meant stumbling around looking for the switch on a lamp across the room . All in all a disappointment . And I haven ' t mentioned the crowded and chaotic lobby . I don ' t think I ' d return . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was so nice & a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The service was great . Anything we needed , they got it to us with a smile . The hotel was very clean & they took extra measures to make us all feel safe under CO ##VI ##D restrictions . I will definitely be back to visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice high end hotel . Staff was excellent , polite and professional . Room ##s were clean and well furnished . The St ##eak ##house is a must even though there are plenty of good restaurants outside the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first stay at Monaco in Chicago and I loved the lobby , the staff , our room and the location . It is an easy walk to Millennium Park and the Art Institute , close to Michigan Avenue shopping and all downtown sights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This very large hotel has very comfortable rooms and lovely common spaces with a pool and exercise gym and a great restaurant as well as several coffee and lunch venues in the hotel . Well situated . Have stayed here many time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband was attending a conference here , and the front desk staff was very rude . I ' m not sure why the staff would have such a poor attitude . This is the " face " of the hotel . The room was fine , but maybe a bit dusty . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful with car arrangements . Shu ##la ' s was as good as ever . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bad entrance , difficult for u ##ber with luggage , check in floor 20 , difficult check in 2 rooms . Room ##s are awful , best in area , big modern , large t ##v . All the amenities . For the price great . Close to Eat ##aly , new stark ##s ##bu ##ck , theaters AMC , the price for Christmas was very nice [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel puts you in the heart of the best of Chicago . Walk to Soldier Field or the Field Museum of Natural History , enjoy great food at nearby restaurants , or walk to the train for quick transportation anywhere in the city . The staff were so very helpful and welcoming . My fi ##an ##cé and I love our stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel , well appointed , spot ##lessly clean , comfortable mattress , very good bar , small but good breakfast bar and best of all within walking distance of the Gold Coast shops and the North Loop . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I really like Fair ##mont ##s . When my wife and I travel , if the city has a Fair ##mont , its typically where we stay . With that , we ' ve been to some beautiful properties ( Lake Louise , Ban ##ff , San Francisco ) . Now with that being said , this is a lovely hotel . It may not have the grand ##ios ##e as some of the other properties , but the staff is incredible , the rooms im ##ma ##culate , and you can walk or train anywhere in the city . Next time in Chicago , I know where I am staying . [SEP]
1	[CLS] De ##fin ##ite ##ly the best value in Chicago . Full ##y renovated , very ch ##ic and clean . Great location and views from the higher floors . Price includes breakfast and dinner . ( although we ate elsewhere . . . ) We liked the suite - kitchen ##ette , pull out couch in real living room , and bedroom with bathroom . Only issue is the bedroom doors closed in a weird way and therefore the doors didn ' t really lock . ( insert embarrassing story here . . . ) Even a small child could push them open . So make sure to bring a scarf or something to tie the door handles together if you really want , er , privacy . * ah ##em * Otherwise , a wonderful property and one I would stay at again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came in on Am ##track and missed my train by 5 minutes . it was pouring rain outside , and the cab that Am ##track provided initially took me to the wrong hotel . By the time I arrived at Swiss ##ote ##l , I was tired and looked like a drowned rat ! Victoria at the registration desk asked how my day was and after I told her , she took pity on me and upgraded me to a beautiful room on the 14th floor with a great view of the river and suggested I go up to the gym on the 43 ##rd floor and see the f ##abulous view there . She made my day by her kindness and compassion . I have never stayed in one of your hotels before but will certainly plan to stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l any time we come to Chicago ! My sincere thanks to Victoria for her outstanding customer service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We bought a new home in Chicago and needed a place to stay for the night - we reached out to B ##re as she took care of us in LA at another hotel . We told her we needed two beds as we had our kids , she upgraded us to a suite and had two roll ##away ##s setup with welcome gifts for our kids ! Such a nice touch , the kids didn ' t want to leave . Everyone was so welcoming and made sure we felt at home . The hotel is a hidden g ##em - my kids are still asking to move in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ' t say one bad thing about this hotel . Room ##s are f ##abulous with a view . Bath ##room big . Location perfect . Staff excellent - from v ##alet to check in . Breakfast is free . Orange juice bag ##els cereal ##s Danish and coffee . It ' s on every floor so you bring it back to your room ! Perfect ! Happy hour was great . We went at 5 - Had free drinks . Food was really good . From good cheese ##s to sa ##lam ##i to g ##ua ##cam ##ole And pizza . Free fruit water in the lobby and newspapers . I would recommend this bout ##ique hotel to everyone . And when I return to Chicago I will most certainly stay there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel in a great location . Friendly staff , good food , clean and comfortable room . Was here for a business conference and had everything I needed and provided with a smile . High ##ly re ##cco ##mme ##nd [SEP]
1	[CLS] At the Chicago Hilton right now with a group of eight “ close ” women - close enough that we are sharing two adjoining and not connected rooms with two queen ##s each and T ##W ##O F ##U ##LL BA ##TH ##S ! Easy walk to both red and blue lines , across the street from Grant Park area and everything about the hotel is just lovely . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay here yearly with my kids & mom . Love the Palmer House & it ’ s history . I stay in a 2 ##B 2 ##B ##a room on the executive floor . Love the amenities this floor offers ! We can ’ t wait for the pool to re ##ope ##n but still use the amazing fitness center while there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Business travel ##er , spent a week here . . . super close to shopping , restaurants , the river , the lake , and walking to anything . Pool and fitness center are nice . Staff is great . Only down ##side is the city noise of sire ##ns and horns all night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Palmer House as part of a stay and play for volleyball tournament . Our two double beds looked more like twins , there was no refrigerator ( some rooms had them , others did not ) , the air vent in the bath was full of dust , and we waited nearly 25 minutes for an extra set of towels . Our room looked nothing like the photos posted on their website ; ours was cramped . Ad ##d to that the large cock ##roach we found in the bathroom and we were obviously less than impressed . When we spoke with the front desk about the cock ##roach , they seemed un ##con ##cer ##ned . The hotel lobby is gorgeous , but beyond that , I ’ d say stay away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A perfect place for business or leisure . The compliment ##ary breakfast was always good , not " fancy " but good . Room ##s very comfortable and appreciate the kitchen area . Perfect location , public transportation close and most sites within walking distance [SEP]
1	[CLS] Although it was pretty tight in our room ( family of 5 ) , it was very nice and quiet considering the lobby was bust ##ling with several large parties / conferences . You really can ' t beat the location - - close to the Ma ##g Mile , parks , waterfront , river ##walk , El , etc . The staff ( from the v ##alet to front desk to house ##keeping ) was wonderful and helpful for all of our needs throughout our two - night stay . The lobby has a handful of restaurants / bars and a little market with Star ##bu ##cks . The price for what you get is a no - brain ##er . The only disappointment was that they don ' t have their own pool , but they do have access to an athletic club for an additional fee . We ' d definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great F ##RE ##E breakfast and social / happy hour ! Kind and professional staff , especially the evening din ##ning staff . A ##pp ##re ##cia ##ted the refrigerator , microwave & stove in the room . Park ##ing is a bit high , but in the same range as other hotels downtown . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The common areas are very nice and offer all different types of atmosphere ##s . The food was very good and not over priced . The room was typical , clean and comfortable . I will stay at this location again for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place for a night in the city . Close enough to walk to the Ma ##g Mile for shopping , plenty of eating near by . The train is close to grab one . We were friendly greeted once we arrive by the bell man . He offered to grab our bags - checked in and the employee behind the desk was very friendly . We were actually upgraded to a larger room - without even asking which was a nice surprise . Nice clean room and large enough for the night in the city . The toilet ##ries were great not small little bottle - good products ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The good : This hotel is in a very nice area and the public spaces were pleasant and taste ##fully decorated . The staff was were very polite and helpful . The bad : The rooms . I can appreciate a minimal ##ist theme but to be successful requires fine finishes , attention to the details and clean ##liness . The room failed to meet these basic requirements . I understand that this an older building which may account for the size of the room , which was small , especially the bathroom . But mi ##sma ##tched towels , dirty tile and in ##different house ##keeping is really disappointing in a room at this price . The A / C unit rat ##tles constantly which required us to turn it off to sleep . ( We were told that " that is just how the are " . ) Maybe other rooms are in better shape . I hope so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I reached 11 A . M to hotel . they asked me to wait because there was no room ready . I was too tired after 13 hour flight . i asked front office staff to let me know when room is ready . I was waiting at lobby , They let check in several people before me and forgot to contact me . I had to go to reception many times to ask for check in . I didn ##t have anything from restaurant but they charged me 11 USD . There were some construction work till 7 : 30 P . M without any prior information . room was too noisy . i could not work or sleep . it was impossible to stay in room . Worst experience . So Poor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here during a first trip to Chicago . L ##O ##VE ##D IT ! The location is great , the rooms are beautiful , and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly ( Cole at the front desk was so a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ) . Also , the beds / pillows are so comfortable - I don ' t think I ' ve ever slept so hard in my life ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great birthday get ##away ! Travis H . was a huge help in setting up a great night for my boyfriend ##s birthday . The room was decorated with balloons when we got there , he at ##ten ##tive and always around for questions or anything we needed ! It was in a great area as well . We had a wonderful stay . I would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Julius was a star at check - in and the room had great views ! Everything was smooth and efficient . The room faced the park and the view made up for the traffic noise . Overall a great location and f ##abulous service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great room . Great location . Easy walk to great food . The bed was very comfortable . I liked the suite layout of the room . The was a business meeting that included about 100 people . There was another large group staying at the same time . It didn ' t cause that much of an elevator delay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was amazing ##ly located , the room were very clean and spacious , the staff was friendly and always willing to help . the only recommendation would be to offer soft boiled eggs , or freshly fried eggs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for an academic conference at almost 300 dollars a night . The hotel is beautiful , historic downstairs , but the guest rooms are old with worn beds and spa ##rta ##n accommodation ##s . I had a large room , otherwise I may have left . In hotel dining is over ##p ##rice ##d and rather lack ##luster for that price in portions and taste ( Kitty O ' Shea ##s ) . Come to visit but don ##t stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall the stay was wonderful everything was great the view from the 33rd floor was amazing he hotel it self was breath ##taking . Only down ##side I wish they had fitted sheets on the bed instead of a flat sheet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Typical large conference type H ##ya ##tt with the usual ho ##rdes of conference attendees , flight crews and large groups . The rooms are fine , nothing extraordinary . Ask for a room facing the river . Our meetings were on the lower level which was rather de ##pressing — no windows and low ceilings . Hotel is walking distance from nearly all major sights in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel and location . High ##ly recommend ! ! Close to all amenities . Clean hotel with friendly staff . Next time I am in Chicago my go to hotel is O ##m ##ni on Mi ##cha ##gin Ave . Nice work M ##g ##m ##t team ! ! Keep up the great work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They staff was very helpful and the suite was perfect for our friends to gather . Perfect weekend ! We loved the location and would highly recommend to others . Very cool lobby and bar area as well . A must ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is very clean . Its also in a great location . The staff was very professional . You will definitely get your money ' s worth . I recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago loop . I look forward to staying here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] She ##ets were dirty but was attended to after I complained . The bill was wrong but was fixed after I brought it to their attention ( umbrella deposit was not removed despite me specifically asked the gentleman to do so upon returning it the day before ) . There is room for improvement . Co ##mple ##mentary bottles of water is a great gesture . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I traveled here with another couple . Great hotel with the best location in Chicago . You can walk everywhere . Nice to have Michael Jordan ’ s restaurant in the lobby . The people at the bell desk and out front of the hotel were so pleasant and helpful . Who really made our stay so wonderful was Luis at the bar in Michael Jordan ’ s . He ’ s the sweet ##est man and truly an amazing bartender . Will be back again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great destinations for family travel . Great breakfast ! Love the pool and views of downtown ! The kitchen gives more flexibility to snack ##s , meals , especially when the group includes to ##ddler ##s . Excellent service with door and v ##alet parking staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose the Home ##wood Suite ##s based on location and also we love the brand . Location can ' t be beat you can walk to most anywhere and red line is a 2 minute walk from the hotel which was great because it was rainy and cool for much of the three days we were there . The hotel itself was great staff are excellent especially those working the breakfast and evening social , they are quick to come around and pour you another beer or glass of wine . Pool is good sized for a city hotel and kept at a nice temperature plus has long hours and fitness equipment was in good shape . We had a king studio over looking the W ##rig ##ley building clock . Would definitely stay again of in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Besides a house that was converted into a hotel I stayed at in Spain , this is the smallest room I ’ ve stayed in . You will have to step over the toilet to get out of the shower . This shower does deserve 3 stars because of its great location but that ’ s about it . Not worth the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This facility is very large . But , it surprised me that it could be so comfortable and welcoming . Friendly , professional staff . Very clean . Used the work ##out facility daily and was very satisfied with the number of machines available . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We spent a fun weekend in the Wind ##y City with the Palmer House as our home base . It was walking distance from everything we wanted to see and do . The building is beautiful and service was first class . We will stay here again when we come back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I think this is one of the best locations in the city . It is removed from the crush of the Loop , but has easy access to the river , the Loop , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and Millennium Park . The hotel has excellent restaurants and a convenient shop . Staff - desk , house ##keeping and car v ##alet - were all welcoming and helpful . The room was large , quiet and comfortable with an amazing view of the river and Lake Michigan . We only wish we could have stayed longer ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at She ##rato ##n Grand for 1 night for a local convention . Friendly front staff and early access to room was a great plus . Lo ##bby and Bar big and comfortable with a lot of seating . The 1 star comes off for the guest room and bathroom which can use a s bit of a face lift . Thin walls created too much sounds of doors slamming and loud people talking through out the night . Star ##bu ##cks cafe is a good boost . Overall a nice property for the business travel ##er . [SEP]
1	[CLS] honestly , the only thing holding me back from a 5 star review is I ' m a pool girl . Other than that , this place is 5 star quality . Service , d ##é ##cor , am ##bian ##ce , location . . . all superior . Our room , 40 ##3 , had a lo ##us ##y view but we really didn ' t care as we are Chicago suburban ##ites and were more interested in access and comfort . Staff is crazy pleasant . Hotel restaurant breakfast was ta ##sty Our stay was paid for related to work so not sure about some of the finances . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has been updated since I stayed there four or five years ago . Everything looks new , even the check - in and dining area . Light ##ing in the bathroom ##s have been upgraded and the beds are comfortable . Staff is top ##not ##ch from the door ##men to the front desk staff to the house ##keeping staff . Only complaint - - and they really need to fix this - - is the Internet connection is a problem . If you can get on , you won ' t be on for long . Staff did bring us up a route ##r that improved things but still was a problem during peak times . If you must have Internet , bring a Mi - Fi connection or some alternative as this will drive you nuts . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room was comfortable , the staff service was excellent . They were always willing to help in any situation . The v ##alet service , while a bit price ##y , was very efficient and made getting in and out of the hotel very simple . We were all treated royal ##ly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First class accommodation in a great location . Con ##ven ##ient to many attractions and shopping . Perfect position between Millennium Park area and north Michigan Avenue and River North . Many first class restaurants nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In the City center you can easily go for one of the big names in Hotels . Out choice has been the Talbot ##t . Because of it ' s location near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and the Old Town . The Talbot ##t is not huge so offers a very friendly atmosphere with a nice bar and restaurant and great Staff . The rooms of course are clean and the bed invites you to sleep forever ! Thank you D ##wayne and Gene for taking care of us . You are great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel located in a great location feet from the Miracle Mile . Everything was great - - from when my cab pulled up to the hotel and an ambassador greeted me to the welcome I got when I got off the elevator . The check in lobby is on the 20th floor . My room had electronic controls that controlled everything from the lights to the blind ##s and shades . The location is fantastic - - near a ton of restaurants and shopping . Room ##s were very nicely decorated and very clean . Everyone was very helpful - I had a very early flight and I called the front desk and they made sure there was a cab downstairs for me . Very well run - - it was what you should expect from a Conrad - - and they delivered . Will definitely return on my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for three nights in November . Great location , helpful staff . Room very clean with nice bed ##ding and du ##vet . Very clean bath with large size tub and separate shower . Room was quiet , even though we were across from the elevators . Large viewing window of the city . Good morning coffee and c ##rois ##san ##ts , though we had to get up early in order to get any c ##rois ##san ##ts , they could be more generous . Lo ##bby was inviting , though the scent ##ed candles were too strong . Co ##m ##fy outdoor seating area . Park ##ing ramp next door and grocery store very convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is a beautiful hotel with friendly , efficient staff . Our room was very clean , spacious , and beautiful . Our view of the city was amazing ! The location was just a very short distance to Michigan Avenue ! Perfect for shopping ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is re ##f ##reshing to stay and be treated as nice here . The place is im ##ma ##culate , the people are friendly , the rooms are clean . If you can , get the Club Level room . The morning coffee and the treats are great . The views are f ##abulous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was literally right across the street from where my daughter needed to go to work , during a short stay for us to see Fleetwood Mac . The rooms had just been re ##mo ##del ##ed , I believe that we may have been the first to occupy the room . It was very nice . twelve foot ceilings , and plenty of extra space around the beds . with a 60 inch flat screen t . v . Bath ##room had very nice marble throughout . Staff was friendly , and at ##ten ##tive . absolutely no negative comments about this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel , very clean ! Friendly staff . Would recommend ! In great area of the city . Walking distance to shopping , site seeing , restaurants . Family friendly , nice views as well . We will be back for sure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff at restaurant were cold and not happy . Bart ##ender however is best in town - Am ##it . Friendly and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Restaurant manager was great when we had an issue with our lunch . But he make it right as best he could . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great place to stay . . they have everything you need . . . stove , fridge , micro , etc . Love ##d going down for a great breakfast in the morning . . The staff are wonderful , very persona ##ble and friendly . . We will most definitely be coming back . . Thanks again for a great stay [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can ' t say there was anything wrong about the hotel . It is a old hotel but nothing was great either . The restaurant was just ok . I had an issue with something flashing in the middle of the night in the room and had to change rooms . Could not figure out what it was . The staff wasn ' t rude but wasn ' t pleasant either . Nothing horrible . The hotel is just ok . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel to Chicago for business regularly and I always stay at the Hotel Monaco . It ' s a great little hotel that ' s located just south of the river . I love the location and the service . The rooms with the window seats are really nice because they ' re huge and comfortable and offer a great view of the city . Sign up for their loyalty program to get free Internet access and credits for the mini ##bar . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice large convention - type hotel that is very comfortable with a great location in the heart of Chicago . Bed ##s were comfortable and room was clean with nice design . We have stayed here often and have been pleased with our stay every time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No ordering of room service from restaurant on the weekends . There are several wonderful restaurants with in the hotel if you choose to din ##e for breakfast , lunch or dinner , but it just was not what I wanted and therefore I ordered out and had my meals delivered to the hotel and I had to go down to the lobby to pick them up . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here multiple times because of it ' s location away from downtown and have always had a pleasant stay . Mini ##mal ##ist de ##cor but a happening bar . Staff is always very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Corner rooms are very spacious ( this last time was # 80 ##7 ) and this time , had a nice view of the lake . One of these times , I ' ll figure out how the ambient lighting in the room works ! Ask for a higher floor as it can get loud on weekend nights due to lobby activity . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gwen and De ##ion are hands down what makes this hotel amazing ! From the second I walked in the door , every time I left and came back , and when I checked out they made me feel like we were old friends . They also had the entire staff wishing me happy birthday and it was the B ##ES ##T hotel experience I ' ve ever had . The hotel itself is under renovation , however there were no disruption ##s because of it and they hid the renovations well . The rooms are huge , and Fi ##sk & Co is connected to the hotel . Great location - close to the Met ##ra , River Walk , Millennium Park and tons of restaurants and bars . This is the only hotel I ' ll be staying at when I go to Chicago from now on . Thank you Gwen and De ##ion ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I want to thank the entire Fair ##mont Gold Team for creating a memorable and enjoyable experience for my daughter and me . The club level access created a welcomed re ##sp ##ite several times during our two days . Wonderful breakfast with g ##lut ##en - free bread was a nice touch . We enjoyed services at the spa , too . Go to the spa 30 minutes early and enjoy the steam room . Our room upgrade to a corner suite really gave us the extra space to spread out and enjoy a drama - free environment . Thank you , Gold Team , for creating a true retreat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location and attention to detail was superior . The staff was helpful , friendly , efficient and very pleasant . The room was extremely clean and very comfortable and spacious . From the front desk staff to the house ##keeping crew and Bell captain and parking crew , everyone was knowledge ##able and extremely efficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in was a breeze . The room , although small , was comfortable , especially the bed . The bar had knowledge bartender ##s and a nice drink list , and the free sparkling wine hour from 5 - 6 pm every night was a nice touch . Only down ##side : one of the three elevators was not working and the remaining ones were exceeding ##ly slow . We waited on our 11th floor for almost 15 minutes before taking the stairs down one morning . Overall , however , I would absolutely stay here again . A short walk from the train , close to many great restaurants and things to see / do , and a great value . [SEP]
0	[CLS] S ##pent one night at the Hilton Chicago and was welcomed with an upgrade as a Diamond member in a suite with some of the most incredible views I ' ve ever experienced in Chicago . This property is gigantic , historic , and there are limit ##less food and beverage options . They provided directions and even suggested the closest late night eat ##eries once room service had closed . Safe area with easy walking access to museums nearby . Robert is an incredible asset to Hilton and made sure my room and stay was remarkable . I will absolutely stay here again . I would say that this and the W ##aldo ##rf Chicago are now my two favorites in this city , also I love the Palmer House . Thank you to everyone who made this weekend celebration so special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On a family road trip Sept 2014 [ not 15 ] from Niagara Falls Canada to Chicago to scratch off another one from my bucket list a na ##sca ##r race at Chicago ##land race ##way , after researching T / A the Ki ##nz ##e Hotel came up t ##rump ##s , everything was excellent , v ##alet service we stopped right out the front of the hotel with our hire car v ##alet parking was not expensive , port ##ers for your luggage , right in the centre of town , house of blues bar just around the corner heap ##s of restaurants and bars , felt very safe walking around at night would highly recommend the Ki ##nz ##e Hotel .

1	[CLS] The Intercontinental was a dream . The views of the city from my room were wonderful , and walking distance from so many things - all down Ma ##g Mile , out to the river walk and to the hotels I needed to get to for meetings .

0	[CLS] The hotel has always been a favorite while in Chicago , but this last week they really knocked it out of the park . I had the mi ##s ##fort ##une of becoming ill , and the staff was overwhelming ##ly helpful . An ass ##ort ##ment of b ##land foods , house ##keeping help , and check ins were very much appreciated ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted for my husband birthday He love our trip ! ! Hotel is very nice Room ##s were a bit small but we made it work . They offered a great stay and park package ! Plan on visiting again Will try for larger room away from elevator ( little noisy ) [SEP]

1	[CLS] My b ##f and I stayed here for 4 nights . Was a really good stay . The staff and so so friendly and helpful . The location is key here though . Sit ##uated right on Michigan a ##ve . You walk right on to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . The parking is price ##y though . 75 us ##d for v ##alet . We found parking one block away through spot hero , for a fraction of the price . I would recommend that ! Overall a beautiful beautiful hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first stay at The Talbot ##t , and I was traveling by myself for a work conference . The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful - - especially D ##wayne , who always greeted me by name with a smile and made sure to hail the best cab ##s for me ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent two nights here on recent trip to Chicago . Nice hotel and in a great location . Not sure about the " destination " fee charged per day ! Also don ' t touch the good ##ies in the tray in the room big brother is watching and you ' ll be charged ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is old and smells terrible when you first walk in the room . You will be charged to put your personal items to the fridge . I thought I rented the room came with a fridge . Park ##ing is $ 73 / day . The service was colder than the wind ##y weather here in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is traditional Fair ##mont , large , fairly elegant , well located by Millennium Park , Lake Michigan , Ma ##g Mile . It is definitely worth some extra money to get Sign ##ature Room with the view . Service is quite good , rooms and bathroom ##s are spacious and well appointed . Room ##s show some age , and can use some fresh de ##cor . . The common areas and their restaurant Columbus Ta ##p are not quite impressive now , possibly CO ##VI ##D contributed to it : not being used enough . With Platinum A ##cco ##r status , and free room upgrade , plus other extra ##s / free ##bies , it was quite decent value for one night stay . I do like Fair ##mont brand , one of the best in A ##cco ##r portfolio . Would recommend Fair ##mont Chicago , especially if the price is right . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great three night stay last weekend . Great room at a good price . Connection to the p ##ed ##way made it easy to get around downtown without the traffic and with air conditioning . Super clean large room with a great view of millennium park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very modern fresh feel to this hotel . Best , biggest bathroom in any hotel I have E ##VE ##R been in . Only hotel tub I would ever bath ##e in , spot ##lessly clean . Del ##icious ##ly comfortable beds . Con ##cier ##ge was excellent , bar tender and wait staff friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . V ##igi ##lant door ##men . No reason not to stay here . Damn near perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great weekend stay at a wonderful hotel . Can ' t wait to go back . Staff was super friendly and restaurants and bars were great . Looking forward to taking my fi ##ance to the hotel in the near future . The location is wonderful and you feel like you don ' t even have to leave the hotel if you don ' t want to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Second time back to this old favorite since the renovation was completed . Have always loved the location . Staff are as pleasant and welcoming as ever . While the new de ##cor is brighter and less " club ##by " it does not blow me away . Kind of d ##rab and boring . Room ##s are very nicely appointed and comfortable with one major exception ; the bathroom floors are ridiculous ##ly cold . Ha ##ppe ##ned in 2 different rooms / times on 2 different visits . They need to provide a floor covering . The lobby restaurant is a significant improvement over previous versions , but they really need to open earlier than 7 am for us early birds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The former Conrad Hilton , this is a great old hotel with a great location across the street from Grant Park and near the She ##dd A ##qua ##rium and Art Institute of Chicago . Close to trains if that ' s your thing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff with premium accommodation ##s - everything was top notch and the location was A + . I appreciated the well appointed bathroom with soap ##s & lot ##ions with a great scent . Creative cocktail ##s on the top floor with brilliant views of the city . Lo ##bby is on the 20th floor which is different but easy to get used to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed here more than 5 times . The location is great - on the northern part of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ( Michigan Ave ) and closer to Street ##er ##ville / Gold Coast stuff than it is to museum campus activities . The hotel is nice ( 4 or 4 . 5 star ) and is well decorated . The rooms are average with the decoration and size but I ' ve always got a room here relatively cheap so the value is good . If you can get a good price it ' s a nice hotel to stay with great location [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly place to stay . Everyone is very nice . Higher rooms ( above 20 ) have much better views . Breakfast was OK , not as flavor ##ful as I would have hoped , e . g . , fruits not sweet enough . Since it ' s a designated historical building , it would be very difficult to make changes to improve rooms . For example , the rooms are oddly sized relative to the furniture which results in gaps with no furniture . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Too ##k my parents in May for my mom ##s 75 ##th birthday and stayed for 3 nights at the She ##rato ##n grand hotel . An amazing location , a hop away from the magnificent mile . Room ##s were clean , beds so com ##fy , staff were awesome and gave us a great breakfast place to eat at . An awesome experience . Dog friendly hotel which was cool we got to play with some great pets in the hotel lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the amazing interior to the spectacular views from the room this hotel is the only one i will stay at while in Chicago . . . . Lane ##tte , Q , and will at the front desk are so knowledge ##able and make you feel like family when staying here . . . . Custom ##er service was exceptional . . . Special Thanks to Lane ##tte for making my stay above and beyond the expected . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Beautiful City to visit , we had a good a time . So ##fit ##el Hotel was amazing , Beautiful and clean . The staff was friendly , starting from the v ##alet to the front desk . I highly recommend it , we stayed one of their luxury rooms located on the higher floors and the City view was Amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It takes more than a glass of prose ##cco at happy hour to be a good hotel . Front desk supervisor was un ##p ##ro ##fe ##ssion ##al , rude , and in ##ef ##ficient . Con ##cier ##ge didn ’ t follow through with request . Room ##s are terrible — tiny bathroom closet ##s in some , adjoining doors with 2 inch gaps in others . Bad banquet food . Only bright spot was the restaurant for breakfast — god food , delight ##ful servers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] excellent stay and perfect location . nice de ##cor I took care of my parking the staff were friendly and responded with my question extremely fast sorry I ' m running out of things to say and I need to cook dinner now . how about changing how long the review needs to be ? [SEP]
0	[CLS] We choose to visit Chicago cause it ’ s famous tourist place and pizza state ! The stay at Palmer House hotel is amazing affordable price and the hotel is very class ##y elegant . I recommend this hotel to stay in Chicago ! Also in downtown walking distance to places to visit like Sky Deck and Mill ##ini ##ue ##m Park ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] this hotel is in a great location with top of the line features and amenities . The rooms are brand new and the front desk and door ##men / women were way above average . i highly recommend room service too as i had it a few nights and it was out of this world ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved staying at the Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro while in Chicago for business ! It ’ s in a great location in the theater district , surrounded by lots of restaurants and bars , and super close to the train station which made na ##vi ##gating from the airport effort ##less . The rooms are clean and sleek and the mini bar is stock ##ed with anything you might c ##rave . The best part is the happy hour prose ##cco every night and the free bicycle rental ##s . I ’ ll definitely be coming back next time I ’ m in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Last week third time we have stayed there in past year . Great location and staff . Have to single out S ##hari ##sse ( s ##p ? ) in the bar area . She was a pleasure to have as our server , up ##beat and enjoyable to talk to . Very knowledge ##able about drinks and helped us with some local and new g ##in and vodka recommendations . Even more , she recommended another night spot to go to in the area that evening , and gave us the names of two people we should ask for . We enjoy the entire staff and property as well . As someone else noted , Wayne was also especially helpful , professional and accessible . High ##ly recommend The Ambassador . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had no idea what to expect when we entered this hotel . It was amazing ##ly beautiful . This hotel is huge but you still feel comfortable . The staff was readily available to help . Our room was comfortable . There are shops on the first level for convenience . The walls on our floor had pictures of celebrates which was a way to help find your room . They also added interest and discussions along the way to and from our room . I took pictures of the lobby and historic doors on the first level . This was a great historic hotel with old world beauty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms were lovely , quiet , clean and had great beds . Located close to the Red line train ( easy connection to the Blue line for access to / from O ' Hare and bus services to all likely tourist attractions , this is a wonderful ##ly located hotel in a beautiful area . There are most well known stores within easy walking distance as well as access to loads of restaurants , Di ##v ##vy bikes and the waters ##ide paths . Ask about the hotel ' s history and ask to see the Ball ##room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel is a nice hotel with exceptional service . Rosemary made us feel at home , and I appreciated having her take care of our room . I have never left a review for a hotel before , the only reason I am is because of how nice and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble Rosemary was . Thanks for making our stay great ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The best hotel in Chicago . The staff are extremely well trained and their attention to detail is un ##mat ##ched . The Conrad is perfectly located right in the middle of Michigan Avenue . You won ’ t be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment you arrive the front desk delight ##fully welcome ##s you . Room is im ##ma ##culate . Guest service response was pro ##mpt when asked a question . Overall an exceptional stay . Great location in the heart of Chicago . Near fantastic shopping and Restaurant ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We wrote a review nearly six years ago and having just stayed here again , I ' m still of the opinion that this is a great place to stay . This time around I was here for a conference , but the room was still quite spacious , and had a top floor ( 33 ) with great views of the park , the air conditioning kept the room at a constant temperature , the bathroom was spacious with a separate shower and tub , and everything worked . The conference meals were excellent , as well as the breaks , and the Ta ##p room had a good selection of beers and an im ##agi ##nat ##ive menu for late night m ##unch ##ies . The check - in staff were friendly and at ##ten ##tive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is , without question , the clean ##est hotel I have ever stayed in . The room was im ##ma ##culate . So much so , it looked as if the up ##hol ##ster ##y had just been cleaned . The bathroom literally spark ##led . I had stayed here two years earlier , and the room look exactly the same . It was as if it had just been renovated . I had to work in the room and the internet was top notch . The staff was friendly , and I enjoyed both the continental breakfast and the evening happy hour . BR ##AV ##O ! Well Done ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my room . The split elevator situation was odd and confusing . The pool was disappointing , very loud all the time . Other than that , good staff ! And of course the hotel smelled wonderful with O ##m ##ni ' s signature scent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] High ##ly recommended for location service and style . The hotel has a lovely rivers ##ide seating area for drinks and snack ##s . A small shop breakfast diner and Star ##bu ##cks coffee shop along with a lovely steak restaurant . Just a short walk from the main area and plenty taxi available for further a ##field . No complaints all positive would definitely stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was an excellent choice and value . The rooms were very comfortable . The only challenge was finding the hotel . My go ##og ##le maps had a hard time because the hotel sits on top of a freeway system under Chicago and the maps have a hard time na ##vi ##gating in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel but rooms need re ##nova ##ting ; staff is phenomena ##l . Hospital ##ity at its finest . Always feel safe ; return whenever in Chicago and always try to stay at Fair ##mont if it is in a city I ##m traveling to . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This landmark venue has ben wonderful ##ly and carefully restored . Room ##s are very comfortable , and well - appointed . The staff was incredibly kind and g ##rac ##ious - I arrived very late as a result of weather and fur ##lough ##ed personnel ; the staff couldn ' t have been nice ##r and more efficient in getting me checked in after midnight with a 05 ##30 conference call looming . Equal ##ly te ##rri ##fic at check ##out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed two nights last week and we were very disappointed It began when we checked in . The check in process takes place in a tiny , tiny , lobby We were checked in by a staff member who could barely look up to talk to us . He seemed beyond bored as he gave us our key and sent us away . The Ki ##nz ##ie hotel is trying to be hip but simply feels cold . Even worse , the rooms either look into neighboring buildings or over ##look air conditioning units . A poor choice out of the hotels in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed here a few times before and it ’ s one of my favorite hotels in Chicago . It ’ s small enough that it feels intimate , yet still offers full service amenities . Really enjoyed the big windows with a great view of the city . The free happy hour is a nice touch . The lounge bar and restaurant are excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Service was exceptional . Friendly and helpful . Will return . A ##rri ##val was a little bump ##y as room wasn ' t ready . However , we were upgraded to a wonderful room . Great views and very comfortable . e [SEP]
1	[CLS] Today that Palmer House has rested on its la ##ure ##ls would be an under ##state ##ment . Yes , the lobby , bar etc are beautiful , but the rooms are quite honestly di ##s ##gra ##ce ##ful . We had to move rooms because our original one was dirty , s ##hab ##by , had p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper and felt horrible . We were moved ( by very polite and helpful staff ) to a bigger room , but in terms of de ##cor , was hardly an improvement . Who has wall ##paper in the bathroom ? The tub was so thin , if you moved it felt as though it might crack . I get that the Palmer House is a beautiful , period building , but it is first and foremost a hotel , where guests should feel that the rooms are clean , comfortable and functional in this modern age . S ##hame on you Hilton ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was very nice and so was the lobby and bar . The hotel was close to the lake , local bars , coffee shops and restaurants . Will stay again on next my visit , hopefully for more than one night , I will be re ##come ##nding to friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently attended a medical conference at this hotel and found the public spaces , restaurants and meeting rooms to be outstanding . The guest room I was assigned was less than acceptable however . The telephone didn ' t work properly and the bathroom had virtually no counter space for personal items . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is hotel is situated in a great location , surrounded as it is by some great restaurants and shopping . The hotel itself is very well appointed - the rooms a good size and well furnished . Sad ##ly my stay was all too short so I did not have chance to fully experience the hotel , but it will be my first port of call when returning to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been coming here for years ! I love the Executive level except , it was too crowded during the holidays for me . I stayed away from the food times because it was chaotic . I like to relax and enjoy the amenities and there are many . My room was wonderful and large with 2 se ##per ##ate baths , 23 - 265 . The downstairs din ##ning areas were wonderful as usual and the staff very helpful and friendly . The location is excellent ! Italian Village , the W ##al ##nut Room , Miller ’ s , shopping , restaurant ’ s gal ##ore , theatres , . . . are a short s ##tro ##ll away . Perfect place to stay . The Drake and Palmer are the two top hotels in my book ! Will not stay elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel ' s location is very convenient . It is just a 5 - 10 minute walk from Millennium Station / Park and steps from the river . Depending on your room , you may get a great window seat overlooking the street and river ( we did ) . The service is what you would expect , perfectly acceptable . There is no breakfast , but they do offer coffee and tea in the morning . My only complaint is the W ##IF ##I . I paid around $ 15 for 24 hours of " faster " W ##IF ##I for 3 devices . There was a cheaper option that I assume would provide a slower connection . The problem is that the W ##IF ##I was NO ##T good at all . It is unacceptable to pay a premium for a " faster " W ##IF ##I connection and have such poor speeds . I believe my tests averaged out to be about 1 . 0 ##M ##b ##ps download speed , and would often be below that . Una ##cc ##ept ##able . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was located on the 16th floor and extremely quiet . Special thanks to Man ##dan ##a in the Fair ##mont Gold Lounge who took excellent care of my family while I attended a conference downstairs . All of the employees made us feel at home and at ##ten ##tive ##ly saw to our needs . As both a business and a family consumer in the same 5 day trip , this hotel both met the business needs of our conference attendees , as well as cater ##ed to families traveling with young children . The location is exceptional - two blocks to Millennium Park or Maggie Dale ##y Park , and a 20 minute walk to the Navy Pier . The re ##vi ##tal ##ized River Walk is also accessible just around the corner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel - professional and court ##eous staff throughout , quick to provide anything asked for ( microwave , towels , etc . ) and just very pleasant people . Very clean and up to date rooms and common areas . Pool was perfect for little kids ( not super big , so can get crowded ) , was a little confusing to get to ( through work ##out room ( super nice ! ) and women ##s / men ##s locker rooms ) . Location was fantastic to everything we needed ( steps from Michigan Ave , close to Water Tower ) and very , very kid friendly . P ##ur ##chase ##d a package with parking included which did save a significant amount of money for the v ##alet . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everyone at the hotel was very welcoming . The hotel is accessible to many wonderful things in the city . Although there were many food options in the hotel , I did not try any . The fitness center had plenty of card ##io machines and weight options . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The service here is amazing ! The assistant manager El ##ly has went above and beyond for me ! She made my stay extremely special . The customers service is the best that I have ever experience , I will definitely return and suggest you visit this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are O ##LD , outlets are few , lighting is horrible , beds were lo ##ps ##ided , room service wouldn ' t leave us drinking glasses , 2 bathroom ##s , one ' s shower was blocked by toilet , L ##O ##U ##D , room service food was disgusting ##ly bad ( except for breakfast ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is nice and in a great location . The views are great or at least from my room . Room was very clean . It is a little out of date for the price they are asking . Car ##pet ##s in the hall ways and rooms look a little worn . I was so cold that I wanted to take a soaking in the tub and the water was light brown so that was a no go . Not sure if it hadn ’ t been used in a while and was just r ##ust or the way the water was . The sink water and shower water was ok . Lo ##bby staff were great and gave good suggestions on places to eat and how to get around . The restaurant located in the hotel was good but service was a little slow . I would stay there again for sure but ask if there was a recent re ##mo ##del ##ed room . My stay was Dec 29th th ##ru Jan 1st so it was very very cold . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lo ##bby is classic ornate masterpiece dating back a hundred years . The hotel rooms also appear to date back 100 years . . . maybe 50 years . Bath ##room was nasty with ca ##ul ##k in shower and around toilet that looked like a 10 year old did the job . I dated the bathroom based on the shower knob , which is the same m ##oe ##n valve that was in my home growing up — 1960 ’ s edition . I paid for a king size bed , but room had a queen size bed . I noticed this after we got back to room after an event so it was too late to change . There are so many beautiful hotels in the loop , I suggest staying at anyone of them . But come here for cocktail if you want to sit in a beautiful lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We couldn ' t have been more impressed with this hotel . Service was excellent as is the location and the value . Room ##s very clean and modern . Only down ##side was the quality of the sofa - bed , but the kids didn ' t seem to mind . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great rooms , excellent evening reception and breakfast , wonderful staff and v ##alet parking . However I hope one never has to deal with GM there . Being a diamond member my choice of hotels are always Hilton chain . This hotel endless ##ly charged my card , while their system showed declined , charges continue to go through . Watch your charges . Was very pleasant stay until check ##out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed through price ##line , requested a king bed however they had us in a double queen room . We were given the option of up ##grading to a higher floor with a king bed for $ 30 per night . We did however I felt a little " bait and switch " maneuver going on there . Overall the room was clean and nice , parking at the hotel was on the extreme price level ( $ 70 + city taxes ) , so we opted for a spot hero for $ 23 per day and was . 2 of a mile from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed this stay . The room was amazing , s ##ha ##un at bar was a delight . I had a small mix up with the room but thanks to Travis & Grace out front my stay was br ##ill ##ient and you will see me again . Beautiful de ##co ##ur . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is well located . The Superior King room is a good value . It is room ##y . The bathroom has lots of shelf space . The hotel is well maintained . The staff is helpful . The bar is great . The bartender ##s make a great ma ##rt ##ini . My wife and I travel to Chicago at least ten times a year . We stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker often . Never disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel has one of the best location in downtown Chicago . You can get the best view of Chicago from your room . The service in the hotel is also excellent , especially the v ##alet service . Solomon is a really nice guy . He recommended us a lot of interesting places in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ' t say enough about how great my stay at The Talbot ##t was . Jane and Tanner at the front desk are so warm and friendly . They made the check in process a breeze . I stayed in a junior suite and the room is exactly as you see in the pictures . Spa ##cious and excellent de ##cor . Clean and set up well . The bathroom was a nice size and left plenty of room for two ladies to get ready ! We went to the bar / restaurant and also had excellent service . The area of the hotel is super safe with plenty to keep you busy , I can ' t wait to come back and stay with the Talbot ##t again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] 2nd year in a row the v ##alet department has lost our baggage . The breakfast was magnificent ! We purchased the breakfast b ##uff ##et price ##y but good and the service that morning was superb ! Not much to say about the price ##y v ##alet . No one in site day we arrived or departed but we paid ahead of time for this service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have booked The Talbot ##t hotel after doing many reviews and comparisons . The room I booked was a 2 queen beds as and it was massive , I am sure it is very difficult to find such size in mid - Chicago . The location is central with many things to do nearby , within 10 - 15 min ##s walking . The lift is a bit slow but no big deal . Will definitely consider staying there again if in central Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am business plus card holder and gold member of A ##cco ##r Hotels . Most of time have good experience but was not satisfied with this booking and stayed for one night only . Next three days I had booked in ma ##rri ##ot . Although was not member but had better experience . I feel P ##ull ##man De ##ira Dubai is best in the world according to my experience of A ##cco ##r hotels [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a gorgeous hotel in downtown Chicago . The charm of the historic building was preserved in the lobby and main lounge area , but rooms have been updated with the latest in modern convenience and style . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was great . The customer service was on point . The room was very clean and the bed was crazy comfortable . I was in for a business meeting and the hotel was perfect for the event . I loved the out door seating , it was a nice added bonus [SEP]
1	[CLS] Road trip to Chicago during a crazy time in our world . The So ##fit ##el is a beautiful hotel at a reasonable price in a wonderful location . It is a block away from Chicago ' s Miracle Mile and John Hancock Building . The hotel was clean , room spot ##less , and large . It was nice and modern . Staff was very nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting for any request in this difficult time . High ##ly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] 4 stars on a scale of 20 maybe . I didn ' t even spend the night . Apart from the great location , I am really confused as to why this is so popular . There were stain ##s on the bed skirt and I was under ##w ##hel ##med by the lobby . It definitely had an institutional feel with no over ##ar ##ching d ##é ##cor or any luxury feel . There are so many better options for the price . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The rooms are beautiful and the location is perfect for Chicago , but the best part of my stay was the customer service . I was attending a conference there , so I can say the meeting spaces are also lovely and catering was delicious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Can ’ t get a better location . close to everything . Everything about this place is amazing . They leave no detail to chance . Everything is met ##ic ##ulously attended to . Hotel staff was great . F ##abulous room . Fine ##st pool I ’ ve ever seen in all my travels . Just gorgeous . St ##aine ##d glass windows , beautiful tile . Looks like they have preserved the original space and tile from 1920s & 30 ##s . Downs ##ide about pool was too many kids on a Saturday morning ; though I have a h ##unch it ’ s better during the week . Try to stay on a higher floor , like floor 20 and above . Makes a big difference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at Ambassador Hotel for work and booked a Lo ##ft Suite . The room was spacious with a great mini ##bar selection and bathroom amenities . It was everything I needed to get me through the work week . I had to store some food items in a larger fridge which Rachel at the front desk helped me with . She was warm , friendly and greeted me by name every morning . She was lovely ! Made me feel at home . I would come back for the great service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had several stays at this She ##rato ##n . . . now as of 18 August a Mar ##riot ##t property . After this stay , I ' ll take a very long break . Very late room avail , well beyond the 3 o ' clock check in . The front desk lines are L ##ON ##G AND PA ##IN ##F ##U ##L . Room ##s are fine - and cookie cutter She ##rato ##n . Small ##ish bathroom . Nice room views when available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the Talbot ##t due to being a H ##ya ##tt member . I was immediately unhappy with the room set up due to no desk for work . The chairs were crush velvet and old re ##ci ##p ##ro ##cal ##s in the room . The bathroom was gorgeous and updated . No coffee pot in the rooms , no coffee in the hotel till after 6 : 30 a . m . I like to have coffee in my room in the morning or the opportunity to order coffee from room service . I was told by the front desk that room service didn ' t serve till am . I was told I could walk to Star ##bu ##cks down the street . NO ##T a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting at all ! Was informed later that I could have requested coffee and a pot , although that wasn ' t offered to me when I called at 5 am . I W ##IL ##L NO ##T be returning to the Talbot ##t ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was very spacious . The bed was awesome . Hot shower water ; great AC . The location of the hotel is across the street from a C ##VS . It ' s also away from the heavy traffic of most downtown streets . Large windows with great views . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Easy and enjoyable walk to Michigan Avenue , excellent staff , delicious food . Lots of lovely homes , restaurants , shopping in this district . There is a view of Lake Michigan from street in front of the hotel entrance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Home ##wood Suite ##s is located a block away from Michigan Ave . It is very central ##ly located , about a 20 min walk from the fur ##thest attraction , very easy to access v ##alet , and is easy to walk to . Vale ##t staff is very friendly , helpful and fast . Hotel staff is very professional and friendly . Any needs where always handled in a time ##ly manner . A real value would be the morning breakfast , evening social hour , v ##alet parking , and internet . Vale ##t has in and out privilege while only costing $ 10 more than regular parking . Overall great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed a room with a view . End ##ed up getting no view at all . The hotel staff were quick to accommodate us with the room we paid for . All staff were class acts and the hotel is very well maintained . We will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was central ##ly located to many downtown attractions and restaurants . It is within a twenty minute walk to restaurants , shops , the Bean and the Navy Pier . The conference rooms were nice , the rooms were comfortable , the restaurants were good , and the staff was friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good location . Would recommend to family and friends . I ##dea ##l place to stay , most places were walking distance . Room ##s were decent size for two people . View of the river ##walk from room was plea ##sing . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will visit again in future [SEP]
1	[CLS] Home ##wood Suite ##s is located at Grand just two blocks from Michigan in a neighborhood with lots of restaurants including Pizza Un ##o and Weber ' S G ##rill . Therefore you do not need transportation for great shopping and food . The hotel is in a 19 floors high modern building with room up from the 6th floor . On that floor is also the reception , breakfast and coffee area and a small shop for drinks and snack ##s . My room , 161 ##3 , was almost oversized with a separate sitting and dining room with a small kitchen and a f ##rit ##ch . Sometimes a t ##the end of the afternoon compliment ##ary snack ##s are served . The staff is friendly . The only m ##nus for this hotel is slow elevator . All in all Home ##wood Suite ##s is e ##en excellent choice if you want to stay in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my second stay at this H ##ya ##tt . Staff and service was excellent ! They were pro ##mpt and court ##eous with every request . I would stay here again . It is on the river and has wonderful views of the Chicago sky ##line and is right off Michigan avenue which is very convenient to shopping and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel in downtown is at a superb location . . very central ##ly located from each and every tourist attraction and a superb locality to stay in . The hotel was extremely warm , hospitality and assistance was superb . . Only 1 in ##con ##ven ##ience was there the swimming pool was under maintenance and we could not use it . Would have loved to know about it earlier when we booked as after going we came to know and we could not do anything about it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I stayed recently in Chicago for a first time visit and we couldn ' t have been happier with the hotel . Our accommodation ##s were comfortable and quiet . The location was very convenient . The staff was very friendly and the con ##cier ##ge was extremely helpful with suggestions to enhance our Chicago visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , great shopping & restaurants nearby . All the staff were very polite and at ##ten ##tive , breakfast was delicious & reasonably priced . Room ##s are clean , com ##fy & quiet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Car ##pet was dirty , base ##boards and door trim are old and have been painted over dozens of times . Door hardware didn ' t work properly . C ##urt ##ain ##s were full of mold . No full body mirror . The lobby was very nice but did not coincide with the rooms / hallway ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked a stay for a convention & got a discount ##ed room rate through a room block , but had to change my reservations at the last minute & come in 2 days early . The room block was sold out & there were no more Deluxe King rooms meaning that my rate was going to double & I was going to have to check in , check out & check into a different room midway through my stay . Crystal Math ##is saved the day & got me a single reservation at the room block reservation without having to change rooms . Thanks a ton Crystal for the G ##RE ##AT customer service ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel ' s location in downtown Chicago as well as the experience of staying . The hotel is close to shopping , restaurants , and coffee shops . Staff was very helpful in making suggestions for eating and sights ##ee ##ing . I will definitely return for leisure since I wasn ' t able to explore while on business . I highly recommend staying ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked the hotel during Chicago Marathon so obviously it was packed to the br ##im . our room and toilet was so small but it is clean . staff ##s was ok as i guess they must be tired due to the over ##flow ##ing of guests . location is just perfect as it is walking distance to everywhere in the loop . train station is also nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in was a pleasure - Will , the door ##man was amazing - friendly , helpful - the gym was a disappointment - the t ##read ##mill measured km ##ph and no one knew how to change it to mph . The pool was amazing but didn ' t open until 7 on weekends so if you are there for business , it makes it difficult to use it for early morning exercise . My room in the executive tower was huge with an update large bathroom however there were a p ##au ##city of outlets to plug in devices . Overall a very good experience . Great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is one of our two favorite hotels in Chicago and this was our third time as guests . It has been updated and is stunning . The evening wine hour and morning coffee are nice bonus ##es . The location is convenient . We knew the hotel was dog - friendly , but didn ' t bring a dog with us . The dog in the room next door barked a lot , including at 3 am . If you stay here without a dog , be sure to ask for a quiet floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You just can ' t beat the location of the Monaco Chicago . Right off Michigan Ave and 1 / 2 block from the Chicago River . The Loop is a few blocks away and the finest restaurants and shopping is blocks north of the hotel . The Monaco is V ##ER ##Y dog friendly and treats 2 legged and 4 legged guest with great care . The Kim ##pton Hotel Group is great ; giving guests premium amenities with hotels in the best areas of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I came to Chicago to meet our twins and celebrate the Easter holiday . I used Hot ##wire to acquire rooms in the hotel for all of us - it was a wonderful experience from the moment we arrived . While waiting for our children we went down to the outdoor cafe area where a charming waiter s ##wo ##oped in with a tray of the M ##OS ##T delicious c ##rois ##san ##ts I have tasted in a long time . Our rooms not only had wonderful views , but were elegant and sophisticated . We were also right in the heart of the shopping district and were able to navigate quickly over the next two days - everything was within a ten minute walk . I would stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Small rooms . No ##is ##y . Door ##s slamming constantly . Staff pleasant apart from a reception ##ist called Edward . While paying my bill he refused to take my coin ##age . Notes or card was all that he would accept . He was quite rude and ad ##aman ##t that this was the hotel policy . No coins accepted over a $ 1 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here because they ' re one of the hotels affiliated to the convention I was attending in Chicago . It didn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . I had a pleasant experience during my whole stay . It was near the places first - time city visitors ought to visit when in the Wind ##y City . C ##VS and Mariano ' s nearby were pretty convenient to walk down to to get supplies from . [SEP]
1	[CLS] a great place to stay . . . close to everything in downtown to include the park and pier . Miller ##s Pub is just up the street and a great place to eat . There area couple of br ##ew - pubs nearby . Everyone at the hotel is helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently attended a conference and stayed at this architectural beauty and convenient location but would i stay again ? We decided on an executive suite which was less than my expectation as well the food in the establish was me ##dio ##cre at best both with the conference at at their adjoining establishments . Staff cleaning the rooms were friendly but reception and others were not engaged . Because our flight left later in the evening , T our choice was to keep our suitcase with us from 11 am - 5 pm or check it in with luggage for a fee of $ 3 . Seriously ? Even in NYC the hotel kept our luggage for free until we hit the airport . This was my first and last Hilton experience . Ex ##pen ##sive is not necessarily better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We would have thought about a higher rating but our standard queen room had only 2 drawers and a closet . Probably one of the worst room storage situations we have ever encountered . For the positive : excellent staff , above average restaurant , and small but extremely nice gym . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a pleasant surprise . Dec ##ided to stay for a meeting instead of the usual big name hotel next door and everything was great . The staff upon arrival were very friendly and were very helpful as I arrived well in advance of check in . Breakfast was good and the room and the beds were very clean and comfortable . Need ##ed to store my luggage as i checked out and still had a couple of meetings before departure to airport and the staff were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my 4th time at the this location . It is such an a ##cco ##mma ##dating facility . Din ##ing , bar and social places are exactly what I expect . Very clean and up to date rooms . I had dinner at St ##ets ##on ' s . My rib eye was done perfect and you had me at pop over . Nice treat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Si ##me ##on Cunningham was the most helpful , patient , and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff member I ' ve dealt with . The firm and myself appreciate your time and help . . . Stay the person you are . Victor Johnson Chief Operations Officer V ##iri ##lis Laboratories [SEP]
1	[CLS] Close to Michigan Ave and restaurants . We heard car alarm ##s going off from the adjacent parking garage . Room was dated and we had dripping from the air conditioning vent . Not bad if you need some extra space for a family but not great . Staff were very nice [SEP]
1	[CLS] A perfect stay at the So ##fit ##el . My room was beautiful , both the room and the bath were in top condition , s ##ty ##lish and perfectly clean . House ##keeping was outstanding ; I never heard a p ##eep from them in the morning ! A pet p ##ee ##ve of mine ; noisy house ##keeping staff . The most I heard was a " b ##on j ##our " one morning . Also , winter is a great time to see Chicago , less crowds and great deals on hotels in the city . Yes , it was cold outside , but there is a big fireplace near the bar in the lobby . All around , very cool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived here after a long flight from Manchester that had been delayed for 5 hours , but we received a very nice welcome and the reception ##ist was extremely helpful and rear ##ranged a show that we should have gone to that night but had to miss because the flight had been delayed . The room was spacious and comfortable and the hotel was in a wonderful location just off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , round the corner from the John Hancock Tower and close to most of the main attractions in Chicago . There was a bar just off the reception area where there was live music on the nights we were there and a great atmosphere [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful location ! Right on Michigan Avenue next to the Peninsula . What a Price performer ! Dec ##ent food and very nice staff . Good for small group business meetings . Room are mostly two room suites the windows are low and strange and the rooms are dark and not my taste but fine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I get to visit Chicago 3 - 4 times per year for work and my first choice in hotels is always the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal . They always deliver great service and the hotel ' s location puts you in the middle of the action with plenty of activities , restaurants and bars all within walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was very friendly and helpful . Room ##s are comfortable and very clean . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located in downtown near shop ##pin , restaurants and fun . Nice on your floor breakfast b ##uff ##et . Bo ##uti ##que hotel so not much of a lobby but nice layout for the rooms . Would stay here again for short stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good experience in downtown Chicago . Modern , clean , professional service . As a Hilton Diamond , it is nice to have a modern , ups ##cale hotel in the downtown Chicago area . The R ##oof ##top bar is perfect to wind down , have a drink and food with great views of the City . The lobby restaurant served a great steak and br ##uss ##els s ##p ##rout ##s along with nice breakfast to start the day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we were here for a wedding week - end of friends . From the minute we walked in we were greeted by friendly , helpful people . From the v ##alet , to check in persons to the manager . They have a decent breakfast which I wish would have served a ta ##d later , to the evening beer & wine and snack . Everyone friendly & helpful . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds , Great lo ##ca ##ion , and very clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean hotel with friendly and helpful staff it was great for our family of four . It was quiet at night , we were able to sleep and walked nearly everywhere . Breakfast was ok , but super awesome that it was included . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here multiple times and have always had a great stay . The staff is great and usually very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The hotel is very modern and has a great v ##ibe . The best part is that they do a Pro ##se ##cco happy hour every day for hotel guest . You just have to show them your room key . They also have kids games and kids good ##y bags at the front desk . The only down ##side is there is no pool and rooms are tight . Other than that it is a great hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] On Dec 15th my girlfriend and I got engaged in millennium park . We decided to stay at nearby Fair ##mont for convenience . When we arrived H ##yon was pleased to learn we had done so . In fact she sent us Cha ##mp ##ai ##gn and straw ##berries ( something I failed in my own planning ) and it arrived in 15 minutes . Fantastic ! My proposal went according to plan and this detail I unfortunately missed so I appreciated that so much . She held the Diamond star rating closely in her mind and delivered a truly memorable evening for us . We have enjoyed many Fair ##mont locations in the past and H ##yon was as good as it gets . Thank you ! Paul & Nat ##hali ##e . [SEP]
1	[CLS] West tower better rooms , re ##gen ##cy club has improved a lot over the years . Always honor global ##ist benefits . Hotel manager pro ##active in reaching out . Live ##ly atmosphere with Michigan a ##ve and attractions nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Michael Y . G ##ave us great service during our short stay here at the Swiss ##ote ##l . His service is pro ##mpt and persona ##ble . Not just with us but with other guests as well . Swiss ##ote ##l is lucky to have him in their employ . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Several examples of great service - - a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting v ##alet service ( worked w / o a hit ##ch ) , great front desk at ##ten ##tive ##ness ( check ##in and directions to the E ##L - late for the Cubs game ) , request for com ##fy co ##t ( - no problem - quickly delivered ) , finally , perfect directions to a late night s ##cot ##ch ( Martin ##i Bar had closed - needed an alternative ) . We ' ll return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every year my sisters , niece ##s and I descend upon the Talbot ##t and their staff for a girls weekend shopping trip . D ##wayne and the rest of the staff always greet us with a smile and help us get rooms near each other , ice , towels , mini fridge - you name it . It ’ s a great location for walking to all the shops and restaurants . See you again in 2019 ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to Chicago with another couple for a 4 day trip and this hotel was great . From the nice rooms to the helpful staff and great cocktail hour we enjoyed it all . It was also fairly easy to walk to the busy shopping places and Navy Pier ( although I would recommend the summer over the winter ) . Some great restaurants / bars in the immediate area and we were able to take short cab rides to both Second City and Soldier Field . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was disappointed in the qualify of the room as it looked nothing like what was shown on line . I did not even stay the night . I left and re - booked at the W ##aldo ##rf after having dinner at The P ##ump Room . The service there was not great but the food was delicious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed there for the Chicago marathon . Close to the start and finish . F ##ac ##ilities were awesome . The staff were very at ##ten ##tive . We stayed on the club floor , the breakfast ##s were good but the can ##ap ##és in the evening were pretty ordinary . Also not used to having to pay for drinks on the club floor [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , very clean , friendly staff , great neighborhood . En ##joy ##ed hanging out in the P ##ump Room , Christmas decorations were beautiful , and the overall experience was very enjoyable . The room was small for 4 people , but it was very clean and updated nicely . Would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the She ##rato ##n Grand for 5 nights . What we liked about the hotel was : location , it was space ##ful , the views , the restaurant and the open spaces . As any 4 star hotel , every service is extra and can be quite price ##y ( such as the mini bar items ) . It ' s a busy hotel , so it is expected to have busy staff too . I want to place my regards to Fe ##lic ##ia , Daniel and Cat ##lin that helped me with some lost item . They were pro ##active and solution makers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Suite ##s Hotel in Chicago ' s located right on The Miracle Mile , right in the heart of shopping & dining . The hotel is beautifully decorated & very clean . The staff , from the v ##alet , to the awesome Nikki at the front desk are very helpful & kind . The rooms are spacious , with separate setting room with a desk , couch , television & bar . The bed is very comfortable with plenty of pillows & a wonderful du ##vet . Plus ##h robes are in the room & the bathroom is very nice & spacious . Try & book the corner suite , as you will have very big windows with a great view of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Outstanding hotel and service in a great location . Great am ##bie ##nce at the bar and very friendly staff . Only complaint is the cost of drinks at the bar and cost of room snack ##s , but I suppose that is due to the location and comparable to other local establishments . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I go to Chicago often , but this was the first time I ' ve stayed at the Conrad . It ' s the only place I ' ll stay from now on . It ' s clean , contemporary , and has a knowledge ##able staff willing to help with anything you need . High ##ly recommended ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the front desk to cleaning person , service was great . Very kid friendly , interaction was great . Stay ##ed mid ##week in standard , mentioned kids ( 2 & 7 ) first trip to Chicago visiting from LA . Kay ##lin very con ##s ##cie ##nti ##ous about space and stay , gave suggestions on closer beach and us an upgrade . Room was very clean and te ##mp was great . Like ##d the later check ##out time , express check ##out and bill available early a . m . Next stay in Chicago will be at K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able and in the heart of Chicago ' s Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Walking distance to restaurants and attractions . Navy Pier a bit further but still walk ##able . We enjoyed staying here . Be aware , parking is expensive - US $ 71 / night , but it ' s expensive everywhere in the downtown [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel by the river . It has The Palm Rest on site which was a plus . Stay ##ed at a one bedroom corner suite , with two bathroom ##s . Perfect when you want space and comfort while traveling with kids . I think the price was great considering it ' s Chicago we ' re talking about . Great view to the city and river . Friendly and helpful staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was nice if not a bit worn . No coffee maker in room ( which I thought was pretty standard ) . En ##co ##urage ##d to hang towels to save water yet no hooks provided on which to do so . Had a challenge on check in with rate booked by corporate contact and Hilton Honors rate - staff were not fully em ##powered to take care of it and I had to work through 800 # staff to do so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was there three nights for a conference . Beautiful , spacious , re ##mo ##del ##ed room on the same floor as the Fair ##mont Gold Lounge , that was well worth the extra price ! The breakfast , snack ##s , loose tea , and drinks were more than enough to make us happy . All wonderful , helpful staff serving us , especially Sharon H . The location was phenomena ##l , right next to Maggie Daily Park . The Art Institute , Navy Pier , and shops on Michigan Avenue are in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed here many times - never disappointed . Service is first class and comfort level is super ##lative . Te ##rri ##fic value . Location is ideal for exploring the city . Would recommend to anyone for any type of trip [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie for St . Patrick ' s Day weekend and it was a great hotel to stay in . Vale ##t parking was available with unlimited use which was great ! The room had a decent view and the room was comfortable and modern . I was only sad ##dened the at the hotel wasn ' t taller for better views of the city . The front desk personnel were amazing in helping me get to locations and find things . I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved my lovely room on the Executive Floor ; however the evening cocktail hour was app ##all ##ing . At most Hilton ’ s around the world the cocktail hour is free wine and pre dinner snack ##s such as cheese and crack ##ers . At the Palmer house i paid $ 14 for house red wine and the snack ##s were awful looking dinner food for which you needed a fork . Many guests were making it into a free dinner . There is no need for that . Some car ##rot sticks and dip and other finger foods that go with free wine would match the class ##iness of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No better choice for price , location , and quality of staff . High ##ly recommend and will be my first choice on any future visits . I ' m not even a rewards member . Walking distance to Navy Pier , Sears / Willis Tower , Mill ##ini ##um Park restaurants , tours , and night life . ON ##L ##Y negative was no room fridge . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is very disappointing to say the least . I booked a 4 . 5 star hotel near Millennium Park because I wanted to be near the action , get a downtown view and have a beautiful hotel room . Upon driving here , I realized I drove past Mill ##ine ##um Park . I checked into the hotel to be told there is no swimming pool or spa . I spent an extra $ 20 for a room upgrade to be given a view of roofs of neighboring buildings . I walked into this tiny room , with the most uncomfortable furniture . The room was hot and must ##y . The tub is small and cramped . I am utterly disgusted with this place as well as with hot ##wire . You should really check out your hotels before you list them as 4 . 5 stars . It ' s not even on the Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile as stated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel - friendly efficient staff . Well run during the conference . G ##reet ##ed by every staff member throughout my stay . I always enjoy staying here . Location is central to all major restaurants for business entertaining . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived for our four night stay about 10 : 30 in the morning expecting to only be able to drop off our luggage and wander around . Gwen ' s fantastic service had us in our room right after a delicious early lunch at the restaurant . Throughout our four nights stay , we enjoyed the company of the te ##rri ##fic staff as well as other guests and their fur babies ! Our trip centered around seeing Bob Mack ##ie ' s f ##abulous costumes in the Ch ##er Show debut ##ing at the nearby Oriental Theater . We even met other guests who had traveled to Chicago for the same reason . Thanks for a memorable vacation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a 4 night vacation and we had a wonderful stay . The hotel is very clean and quiet . From the moment we stepped out of the taxi , the staff made sure we were taken care of . We were welcomed by a very friendly door ##man , and we were greeted very warmly at the front desk . The con ##cier ##ge was always available to recommend things to do , and to book tours and make reservations if needed . The location is amazing , close to the Ma ##g Mile and many restaurants . Overall , we had a great stay and I would highly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Back in my favorite neighborhood in Chicago and my favorite place to stay , The Ambassador . I have seen many changes over the years but the addition of Booth One for dining is an added treat . The menu , atmosphere and service are fl ##aw ##less . As always , my room was spacious , clean and very comfortable . On a sunny day the sunlight floods into the room and I hate to leave for my various business meetings . I was so pleased with The Ambassador that my next visit I will be hosting a cocktail reception in the beautiful library space . Looking forward to another wonderful visit and seeing the friendly staff once again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This used to be a great hotel with a very court ##eous and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Now they are very cheap and treat customers like a herd of cattle . No recognition or reward for Diamond members , no executive level lounge for breakfast , snack ##s , etc . No compliment ##ary breakfast . Room ##s have been updated , but very spare ##ly appointed and street noise reaches even the highest levels . There are many other Hilton family hotels in this area that are much friend ##lier , more a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and with much nice ##r staff personnel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the O ##m ##ni because it was nearby a conference I was attending . My experience was wonderful from start to finish . I was greeted by a bell ##hop who helped get my bags to my room . I expected to need to have the hotel hold them until check - in because I arrived at about 10 ##am . The staff at the desk were able to get me a room right away , which made all the difference . The room was nicely appointed , spacious and clean . Steps from Michigan Ave , it was the perfect home base for my trip . As a select guest member , I had complementary coffee delivered to my room each morning . To top everything off , I accidentally left something in the room and they made it so easy to have it sent back to me . I will be back for the next trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : comfortable room , quiet up on the 24th ? floor , secure , G ##RE ##AT location from which to launch shopping trips by foot . Con ##s : small room , coffee ##maker not great ( typical of hotel coffee ##makers ) , room service is only okay ( unless you get a steak from M ##J ' s ! ) . Really , the grip ##es are small . We weren ' t paying for the room ( business trip ) , so my review is without knowledge of the night ##ly price . Still , it ' s a great hotel . It ' s easily find ##able so it ' s a great base of operations if you ' re touring the south end of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for a few days . A lot to see , Lots to eat , L ##OT ##S of high - end shopping . PS - the worst Star ##bu ##cks we found was attached to this hotel . Luckily another one is just several blocks away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this hotel because we were able to get it at a great price . My favorite guy was John ##nie , he was friendly , funny and made my husband and I feel very welcomed as we got out of the cab . Check in was very easy , room very clean , there were snack ##s and a stock ##ed refrigerator in the room , anything you take will be charged to the room . It ##ems are price ##y ! We did order room service on Sunday so we could have breakfast , pack and get ready for the game . The food was very good and quite large portions thankful ##ly because it was an expensive breakfast ! When we checked out the hotel had a place to store our luggage while we enjoyed the game . All the staff members were friendly and very helpful and a big plus pets are welcomed . There were a few on our floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , especially the front desk Amber , Diana , Michael , and the breakfast staff made me my own pitcher of ice ##d tea ! I definitely felt at home here and the room was a beautiful space w / gorgeous city view , prime location across from Nord ##strom , Sugar Factory , AMC , Michigan Avenue and 2 blocks from W ##rig ##ley B ##ld ##g and Du ##S ##able bridge . Only negative thing was the shower drain was c ##log ##ged , but taken care of within the same day . Afterward there was a sewage smell from the shower and sink drains , but aside from the odor , a great stay at a wonderful Home ##wood Suite ##s ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was great . Clean , easy quick . More importantly before my stay at the hotel I got a call from a Hotel Staff names Ch ##ry ##stal . She let me know that i had double booked my room which was helpful but more importantly , she could not have been more welcoming and helpful . She was enthusiastic on the phone and once she heard I was from Oregon and had never been to Chicago , she helped me out with recommendations and made me feel even more excited to come to Chicago . She was a great way to start off my trip and her professional ##ism and helpful demeanor is greatly appreciated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s in great location , one block off Michigan Ave , close to the parks and the lake . The rooms are large but tired . The material on the chair seat is cracking and fl ##aking away . The bed has a depression in the middle . The room is clean . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at this te ##rri ##fic So ##fit ##el Chicago hotel over 10 years ago and the quality remains as high as ever . It is expensive but worth every penny from the best location , superb staff and restaurant and comfortable rooms with exquisite views . Finally , the French A ##cco ##r Chain is one to follow : I stay regularly at their economy line when in Europe ; The Ada ##gio , also highly recommended for being able to cook during longer stays . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Though we live in downtown Chicago , decided to stay at Hotel Monaco for a night with my dog , Jimmy , to celebrate his 2nd birthday . I informed the hotel and Kim ##pton reservation about his birthday ahead of time . At check - in , we were upgraded to a large suite and tons of good ##ies were delivered to our room for Jimmy . Throughout our stay , the entire staff made sure that Jimmy has the best birthday celebration . I could not thank the hotel staff enough for being so generous and caring towards my little guy . We really loved the wine hour and location of the hotel to walk around . Jimmy and I , will be back soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , but they apparently ignore status . I ’ m diamond and they charged me $ 50 to check ##out 2 - hours late . When they have you they ’ ve got you . Location is good and central to all you ’ ll enjoy in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very clean ups ##cale hotel with great service . Most comfortable hotel bed i have ever slept on . Breakfast was really good with a great view . I feel like the TV on the wall in my room was 70 " . . . way bigger than my one at home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location on Michigan Ave and close to everything Chicago has to offer . Nice ##ly decorated rooms . If visiting in winter , be ##ware rooms a little draft ##y . Family really enjoyed room set up of King plus pull out . Pool and hot tub were appreciated . Lots of kids ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place simply worked perfectly for my needs . I wanted : clean , modern , quiet , no has ##sle , crowd free , spacious room , fast internet , comfortable bed , sparkling bath room , hot coffee in the morning , good value and no nickel and dim ##ing . I got it all and I ' ll come back . All city hotels should be this good ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed one night for a concert in downtown Chicago . We are Disney V ##aca ##tion Club members and used our points to book the room using their Con ##cier ##ge Collection . We had a Gold King room which offered not only a great room but access to the Gold Lounge . Tiffany and Jesus in the lounge took good care of us at both the afternoon tea time and the early evening can ##ap ##e time . Both times there was plenty of food to satisfy us and a great selection of tea ##s to choose from . Our room was very clean , comfortable and offered a great view of the lake . Before checking out in the morning we took advantage of the lounge once again for breakfast . High ##ly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfectly situated between the river and the Hancock . It afford ##s all the l ##ux ##uries at an affordable rate while visiting Chicago . It was a perfect stay for two cousins that were visitors in our own city for a few nights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a perfect location near everything . The staff was super friendly , and the free wine hour is a nice touch . The room was huge , very comfortable , and clean . Overall the cost - to - quality is hard to beat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is set in a great location . The service at reception is great and don ' t forget to get the package which includes the light re ##f ##resh ##ments on level 6 each afternoon . The bed is super com ##fy and bathroom is big and clean . Breakfast is a help yourself on your floor with the tray from your room and you eat it in your room . This suited us as we could get things ready for the day as we snack ##ed on our breakfast and you could go back for more if you needed . The varieties of tea was lovely . The gym was very clean and used daily . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I did not know the hotel was under construction . If I had known , I would have chosen differently . Saturday and Sunday were fairly quiet but sleeping in on Monday is not an option . Perhaps having fewer rooms occupied during the construction would be a good idea ? Or not ##ify people so they could decide if they want to stay here ? Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Even though this historic hotel has undergone a lot of changes , in the 38 y ##rs . I have stayed there ; there is one constant : great and professional service from staff . From the time one pulls up at the doors , until check ##out , staff goes out of it ’ s way to assist guests with every need - sometimes , without being asked . They define hospitality . j ##w [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is right on the river with great views of the river and even Lake Michigan off in the distant . Shu ##la ' s steak ##house in lobby . Great lobby bar . Room ##s are nice but a bit dated . Easy walk shopping and downtown venues . Not close at all to convention center which is case for most hotels . A solid 4 star hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our son ' s proposal of marriage to his lovely bride - to - be near the Chicago Lake ##front was made perfect when we gathered to toast fires ##ide with Champagne at the Hilton . Window - watching Bears fans passing by as we awaited the engaged couple , the staff , am ##bian ##ce and hospitality of the Hilton could not be topped ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Not only was the hotel amazing , the accommodation ##s were on point , the staff so helpful and kind . The location was amazing ! ! And the food and overall atmosphere was just what I was hoping for to complete my summer in Chicago : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The stay was nice ! The hotel was con ##vie ##ntly located near a lot of attractions . The only thing I hate is that there is limited rooms with good views of Lake Michigan and if you request one you are asked to pay a fee . What happens if all of the regular rooms run out . Then you get it for free . Overall ok stay . I would stay again . I guess . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A Great place to stay with top notch guest services . The restaurant P ##ump was excellent with a great waitress that was well informed and inspired some creativity for us at our next Sales Meeting . The rooms were clean and reservations with Dan Kirk ##sey was phenomena ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] perfect location , friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , large well - appointed guest rooms . exceeded my expectations . arrived with many luggage bags , bell captain and team were very welcoming and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here NY ##E for a wedding , and was probably the nice ##st hotel I ' ve stayed at in downtown Chicago . Room was slightly larger than a few other hotels , nice separation between bedroom , bathroom , and " living room " , as it was a suite style room . Staff was friendly . Overall , we weren ' t didn ' t spend very much time at the hotel , but would definitely consider staying there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] They are definitely not on top of the service game at this hotel . They were supposed to text me when my room was ready . They did not . I got into the room and the refrigerator was locked and I had to call to get them to open it up . I stayed for 2 nights and they did not come clean my room during the day despite the fact that I was gone most of the day . The bill was wrong and they charged me twice as much as they should have - I had to go to the front desk and speak to the hotel manager to have it fixed . They told me that the room I was in had been renovated , but it didn ' t seem like it . Overall , I would look for somewhere else to stay unless this property is a much less expensive option than elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel ! ! The architecture was gorgeous especially in the pool area . The staff were extremely kinds and helpful , especially Will . He gave us tips on where to park and where to eat . The room was very comfortable . We were so close to shopping and restaurants and the bus stop was right in front of the hotel to take us to the museums . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every thing went really well from check in to check out . The room was clean and comfortable . Every one was extremely friendly and helpful . The bar area had great drinks and food , Will definitely go to the Swiss ##ote ##l again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We only stayed at the Monaco for one night , but would have loved to stay more . My husband and I love to look out over a city , have a drink , and talk . Therefore , this was the perfect setting for us . We could look over the river and even though January is a quiet time of year there was still plenty of h ##ust ##le and bust ##le to keep us interested . I ' d definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very at ##ten ##tive from the moment we walked in . We were visiting from out - of - state and Melvin was helpful in providing some good recommendations in the area . He is warm and a cut ##ie . He really made us feel welcome . Looking forward to staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Two of my friends and myself stayed here for St . Patrick ' s Day weekend ! Pedro and Miranda at the front desk we ' re super helpful throughout our stay and everyone we came in contact with was awesome ! Security and the bell ##man were also amazing during our stay ! The location was very convenient for everywhere we went that weekend and we got to watch them dye the river green from our hotel window ! Love ##d this property and can ' t wait to stay here next time we ' re Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love everything about this hotel . From the location to the restaurant to the pool . The rooms are so nice and clean and the pool is very spacious and they have a sa ##una as ##well ! The staff is super friendly and the hotel is convenient ##ly located across the street from nor ##ds ##trom ##s on Michigan Ave ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall a great place to stay in downtown Chicago , especially if you book on Price ##line . The king suite with pull ##out sofa held our family in one room . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary dinner and breakfast make it worth staying even if you pay full price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great bout ##ique hotel in the Gold Coast area . Many stores , banks , and restaurants nearby . Something for everyone . I have stayed here before and will again . Room ##s and bathroom ##s are spacious and exceptionally clean , [SEP]
1	[CLS] Historic hotel that is s ##hab ##by . Car ##pet ##s in rooms are warm out and dirty looking . No room service . And no heating in the rooms or meeting room ! In fair ##ness , they finally offered me a space heat ##er when I talked to a manager which helped . Business center limits copies and front desk helped but the copies had streaks across them . . . nothing seemed to work right [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great stay . Very friendly and professional staff and great location . The bed was very good with high quality linen ##s and pillows . Nice selection of products in clean , modern bathroom . Con ##ven ##ient to " L " and Mi ##ch Ave . I ' ll definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton hotels are always great , but this hotel is excellent for service , price , and accommodation ##s . So central in the Downtown Chicago Loop with a short walking distance to Millennium Park and the Art Institute . Room was exceptionally nice with best pillows ever experienced in a hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed our stay and would love to return in a few years . Staff are very friendly . Beer selection was great , but never had a chance to try them all : ( High ##ly re ##com ##men ##ced if you need to find a place downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is te ##rri ##fic . . near Michigan Avenue and right on the river . All staff super nice and re ##sp ##ons ##ive to requests for services . Only things I didn ’ t like were the food options were not great for ve ##get ##arians . . . the charging of anything in the mini bar or on top of counter gets moved ( we weren ’ t charged it ’ s just annoying to think if we move something we could be and because of this there was no usable fridge in the room ) and the rooms were a bit small and old for the price . Love that it ’ s dog friendly ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was clean and the staff were wonderful , especially Medina . She really was wonderful ##ly helpful ! She watched out for us and we appreciate the tender care we received . Check ##out was very simple , and we appreciated the location of the hotel which was super . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this on Group ##on for an evening downtown for my husbands birthday . We got treated royal ##ly throughout the evening even with our room check - in de ##ba ##cle . We got sent to two rooms that were not in service before we got upgraded and a free dinner . They covered their tracks well . It has an old feel to it with modern de ##cor . Would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a surprise ! Am ##id other larger , expensive hotels this is a little jewel . It ' s just north of the river on W . Ki ##nz ##ie . Bo ##uti ##que style , only 6 floors , Quick , very easy check - in . Free has ##sle - free w ##if ##i . A nice happy hour 5 - 7 , beer wine and snack ##s in a comfortable setting . The included continental breakfast had a good variety . The rooms were clean , new and well equipped . The bed and pillows were very comfortable . There wasn ' t much a view . Nice selection of toilet ##ries , plenty of towels and the bathroom was modern . There were a few striker ##s outside , but they were polite - hope it works out for the hotel and them . The Ki ##nz ##ie is a great spot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel greatly exceeded our expectations . We booked last minute through hotels tonight app and it will now be our regular place to stay . Staff was very friendly and helpful . We really enjoyed our stay ! I believe my husband called back to get details on the bed ##ding and comfort ##er because it was amazing ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the Fair ##mont Chicago . My guest ##room was fine , but it was Del ##ores in the gold club on the 15th floor made my stay ! She is at ##ten ##tive , caring and engaging . I would return to the hotel due to this superb level of service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The She ##rato ##n Grand is a cut above other hotels in the chain . Central ##ly located and with direct access to the river walk and close to the shops and restaurants on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , it ' s ideal for both business and pleasure . The staff are wonderful and will do everything they can to make your stay a pleasant one . A big shout out to Rene in the Club Lounge , who is one of the nice ##st people I ' ve ever met . He took such good care of us , and went over and above the call of duty to make us and the other guests feel welcome . I hope the management realizes what a g ##em they have in him as he seems to truly love what he does and really knows what customer service is all about . Thank you so much for a wonderful stay . The three ladies from Canada are your # 1 fans Rene . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was professional , court ##eous , and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to my stay . My room was clean with a beautiful view . The only complaint would be the swimming pool is small and no hot tub . Great gym , sa ##una , etc . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located , clean and comfortable , polite , capable and helpful staff . Guest ##s are well taken care of , not p ##amp ##ered , which is how I like it in cities . Next door to the Trump , priced about half as much , easier to get in and out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A nice ##r hotel than we usually stay in - - everything was great . Special shout - outs to reception staff Hugo and Shin ##ita , who , when they found out ( we told them . . . ) that we were there for our wedding anniversary , arranged for some nice com ##ps and per ##ks : Hugo upgraded our room to a nice ##r one , and on the water - view of the 30th floor , and had a free bottle of ice ##d champagne sent up that night , and Shin ##ita scored us 2 free breakfast ##s at the nice restaurant in the hotel . We appreciate those staff members giving us the personal touch in a generous way ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service , a ##cco ##mo ##dation ##s and a variety of upgrades / add ##ons / etc . Close to many things ( easy to stay busy ) yet comfortable to stay in the whole weekend and never get bored . Staff was very a ##cco ##mo ##dating , had plenty of advice and let us be when we wanted quiet time . We do not see the need to go anywhere else . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Every member of the staff at this hotel , including the parking service , contributed to our outstanding stay . We were consistently greeted with a smile and something more - - bottle ##d water at check in , help with clearing dishes at the b ##ou ##nti ##ful free breakfast , extra coffee in our room , etc . The location is perfect for catching the train to a Cubs game and everything else Chicago has to offer . The de ##cor is taste ##ful , the bed very comfortable and our suite and common areas spot ##less . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was our first time at a k ##im ##pton hotel . We checked in at the front desk , and there were problems with the computer system but the staff was friendly and a ##pol ##og ##etic for the delay . We were able to have our room upgraded and were pleasant ##ly surprised when root beer and ch ##ica ##go style pop ##corn were delivered to our room ! The room was very comfortable as were the bath ##robe ##s . The hotel is in the theater district and near the El , making Chicago very easy to navigate and explore . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel , restaurant and ma ##rt ##ini bar were great . Great staff , good food and spectacular drinks . The rooms was spacious and very clean . The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious . We will definitely come back the next time we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3rd time here , first without getting the gold upgrade . Was definitely a mistake . The quality of the stay without the Gold upgrade did not match our expectations , and what money was saved not getting the upgrade was spent at the hotel , because we did not get the upgrade . The price does not include breakfast or parking , and 2 days of parking cost more than another night . It ' s a nice hotel and the service and staff were great , but the upgrade cost having doubled in 2 years was concerning , but would have been worth it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are regular guests at She ##rato ##n chain in Europe and the US . We arrived to the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago hotel from NY to attend an unexpected funeral in Chicago . We were tired and sad . We encountered a number of regular problems at the hotel , and might have given up if it were not for a wonderful manager , Mr . Wisdom A . , who listened to us carefully , helped us with our problems and made us feel welcome and special . After the initial hi ##cc ##ups , thanks to Mr . Wisdom , we were able to relax and rest . The hotel is really wonderful overall , but it is people like Mr . Wisdom , who matter most . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really liked the Swiss ##ote ##l , but I won ' t stay there again . Not because I don ' t want to , but because the walking isn ' t easy for someone with knee problems . From Michigan Avenue to the hotel is up ##hill , which isn ' t as easy to navigate as it once was . My friend had trouble with the health facilities . E ##vide ##ntly , there ' s no longer a pool and he was directed to a health club down the street . The room was comfortable , and we opted for the green thing , keeping everything in the room as is and not having towels replaced or the bed made daily . There ' s a nice bar in the lobby as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here in late August because it was close to the training location that I was going to for work . It was also reasonably priced . When you walk in , it is very grand and seemed to be from another ear , yet re ##gal and extremely busy . I went to the check in line on the main level and had to wait a bit longer than I should have . They should have had more associates working the front desk . However , I was checked in and headed to my room . The place i huge with man elevators , but I always seemed to have to wait a bit for the elevators , no matter when I was coming and going . The room itself was out ##dated , but I felt it went along with the overall aesthetic of the hotel . Overall , it was fine and served the purpose well since it was close to my training class . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el may be price ##y , but you get your money ' s worth in terms of comfort , convenience and friend ##liness . The location is excellent for the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and Northwestern Hospital . And it ' s great to stay at a well - run hotel where the staff are re ##sp ##ons ##ive to one ' s needs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an absolutely beautiful hotel located near the C ##IB ##C Theater , Millennium Park , Chicago River , Miller ' s Pub , etc . . Hotel is full of history . Just a short walk from the O ##gi ##l ##vie Transportation Center . A must see ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great staff ; great location ; great value ; two meals included per day . The room is a true suite with a kitchen . Every staff member was helpful and cheerful , convey ##ing a sense that they enjoyed their jobs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel . Great staff , great beds , great location . My family and I stayed during Memorial Day weekend and I would definitely recommend it to people wanting to stay in Chicago . It was super cute and the free drink token ##s were an awesome bonus . My husband left his shoes at the hotel and they were very pro ##mpt and court ##eous in shipping them to us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came here for my daughter , looking for a dress for her wedding . This hotel was a great location for what we were looking for . Love ##d the room , loved the staff , Great place to eat as well . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel in an excellent location . The food staff and service are 1st rate . One of my favorite small hotels . I have stayed there for a number of years and have never been disappointed with the facilities , the service or the food and drink . . I can highly recommend it to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is extremely out ##dated and old . There is obviously a spider / insect problem due to the fact that there were spiders and co ##b ##we ##bs throughout the room and on all of the outer facing windows but the sign ##age on bathroom window that says we do not recommend opening them due to spiders / insects should have been a clear sign . My room specifically was dirty as could be . I was given a $ 75 v ##ou ##cher to make up for it but considering I spent 7 days there , it really did not make up for it . Upon arrival I was also told that the hotel is in an un ##safe location and to not go out alone . I would not stay here again should I return to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in an executive suite . The room was very nice . I ate at Center court and Michael Jordan ' s the food was excellent but , expensive . Service was great , lots of extra ##s . It ' s right on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile . We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do or see . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We skip around to varying Kim ##pton in Chicago , and we ’ re amazed at how nice the re ##mo ##del of the hotel ended up being . Room ##s have a great v ##ibe , very class ##y looking , and we love the new lobby and bar look now . As before , com ##fy beds , very clean rooms , and modern bathroom ##s . The location is always great - right in the heart of it all . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I visited Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago for the first time this year to attend a s ##ym ##po ##sium there . The hotel is located on the river and within walk distance to all fun and food . The staff was great and provided super fast check in although it was very crowded . The room was located on the corner of the building so it had amazing view and size . Check ##out was fl ##aw ##less and to ##ke seconds . When i reached my other hotel in b ##ost ##on , i found out my wallet was still in Chicago so i called the hotel and the lost & found department was happy to inform me that they have it and assured me i will get it as ##ap ( Collin Rod ##eb ##ach was the hero ) . Soon after i got an email from the UP ##S office to get the address . 24 hours later i was walking in Boston with my wallet ! Thanks for helping [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was excellent - food was good . this location is within walking distance of shopping on magnificent mile , walking to Navy Pier or heading south to the Bean . Room ##s where clean and I was impressed by the little extra ##s provided - such as compliment ##ary bottles of water and Ku ##eri ##g in the rooms . I would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ing here for third time and as usual it is super clean and professional Only the lack of pool and fitness because of construction is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 The other change was no more b ##uff ##et breakfast so now you have to sit down and order [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located in a very good spot . Easy access to everything . Room ##s were clean and staff were very nice . All round perfect stay . Nothing to complain about . Its few minutes walk from the t ##rump tower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are old and beat up , need up ##dating and the executive " lounge " is a joke ( over ##crow ##ded in the morning ) and the breakfast offered was sub ##par . I spent the next night at the ha ##mpt ##on inn ma ##je ##stic and their rooms , breakfast and service was significantly better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our suite had no heat which was a major problem in November . Our family froze . We informed the front desk after first sleep ##less night but it was never fixed . Second night was equally cold and sleep ##less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for a girls weekend in the city . The rooms ( we had a suite ) were large , comfortable and clean . The design of the hotel and lobby area are beautiful and the staff are very friendly . The hotel is in a good location for walking around and sights ##ee ##ing , also close to a train station and grocery / pharmacy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable and reasonably priced 4 * hotel in the heart of Chicago downtown . Super ##b location . Very clean rooms . Modern bathroom ##s . Bar open late . Our rate included breakfast which was way above average . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service ! My 3rd time and I love it so much ! Any ##time I stay downtown I want to stay here , the location is perfect . Walking distance with s ##tro ##ller everywhere . No need to worry about car seat l ##ug ##ging . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable and clean with a kitchen and living space . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and near shopping and good restaurants . The staff is friendly and helpful . Yu ##mmy breakfast with lots of choices is included . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a lovely room with a wonderful window seat looking over the Chicago River . Co ##mp ##lie ##m ##ntary wine each evening , and excellent con ##cier ##ge service . Look ##ed right in the Loop and a short walk to the El . I highly recommend this little g ##em ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you want location , a spacious room , superb staff and wonderful accommodation ##s , stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago . We just returned and I can ’ t say enough . The staff was extremely professional . Nothing was ever a problem . From the dining staff , front desk , con ##cier ##ge , to the bell staff , I was extremely impressed . Now let ’ s talk about the room . Every room is a suite , so plenty of room to spread out . There was a king bedroom and a small living room with a little wet bar and refrigerator and sink . Certainly spacious enough for two or more people . The location bordering Michigan Avenue was outstanding . I walked everywhere and felt so safe . I can ’ t wait to return and I hope to make the O ##m ##ni my choice again and again . I am glad I am a Select Guest member , as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I went back and forth with this hotel and another . Very glad I went with the Ki ##nz ##ie . All the staff was very pleasant and friendly . They assisted you right away and always had a smile . The rooms were very clean and a good size . The bed , pillows were very comfortable . The t ##v had a lot of channels to choose from . The mini fridge in rooms is good especially when have left ##overs from one of the great ch ##ica ##go restaurants . I would definitely stay here again . Nice neighborhood in river north and easy walk to get everywhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a nice surprise . We had never stayed here before and wanted to try something different . This definitely feels more like a bout ##ique hotel than a chain . Staff is very helpful and pleasant . What sets it apart ( in addition to the te ##rri ##fic location , as you can walk everywhere from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile to the theater district ) is that it feels like this property has personality . We experienced a hi ##cc ##up with house ##keeping . To our complete surprise , when we returned to our room we found chocolate ##s , wine , and a hand written note . That ' s an extra touch that makes you feel like a guest and not just a visitor . The king rooms facing the river are te ##rri ##fic and worth the little bit extra . We are pick ##y , but we would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a nice hotel , but it could use some up ##dating ( e . g . , fans in bathroom ##s , larger dresser ##s ) . The increased price for the Regency room isn ' t justified - food is less fresh than before , and dessert ##s are much less fancy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed our stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie . Great location for quick walk to many spots . Hotel is quiet , clean and very comfortable . Each floor lobby has nice breakfast selection early in the morning , which is great for quick grab before everyone wakes . I recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were returning on a cross country train trip . The train arrived late to make the connection . Train company paid for the room . A ##rri ##ved at Swiss ##ote ##l and quickly checked in . En ##tered a beautiful room on the 15th floor . Corner room over looking Navy Pier , Ferris Wheel and Lake Michigan . King Si ##ze bed and Queen size fold out , very comfortable ! Lu ##x ##ury bathroom with separate tub and shower . Our train was not leaving until late the next b ##day , the hotel provided courtesy bag check for the day . Return ##ed and retrieved bags , Con ##cier ##ge called for our cab . For the views , I would recommend high floor corner room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment we arrived , to the moment we left , it was a great stay . The de ##cor is amazing , the staff is wonderful , and I love the am ##bie ##nce . The staff checking me in was great , followed up via text , and answered any questions . Marvin , who works out front was so friendly ! Would stay here again in a heartbeat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing location ! So close to everything . Make sure front desk is giving you the room that you are paying for . Had we not ventured into another family members room , we would have not known that we were not given the one bedroom suite as booked . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room on the 24th floor looked west down the river and I couldn ' t get enough of the view . The bed was super com ##fy , elevators were quick and they have several places to eat or drink . A great location - easy to walk to Michigan Ave or Millennium Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As much as I like this French chain and their Hotels . Chicago was a failure on every level ! Em ##p ##loy ##ees just drop the ball left and right . Once you complain , the manager is correct ##ing or trying to correct by some com ##ps just to run into the next situation of failures to start all over again ! Big ##ges ##t disaster is the Front Des ##k and Bell Staff . Wonder how they got the rating they are riding on . That said , the rooms are nice , . . . . but that ' s about it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel had a lot of history and was well kept up . My room was huge and was comfortable . Everyone was helpful and I enjoyed my stay there . The food was good and the conference spaces we used were nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the location , close to the heart of the city . The view from the room was Amazing ! The cleaning ladies had a great attitude and always smiling : ) A lot of business meetings but the hotel flows nicely and doesn ' t feel crowded . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are on 3rd day of stay at Palmer House . 2 / 3 days we have not had house ##keeping services . None . I even called front desk - they said they would " not ##ify house ##keeping " - and nothing . Ask ##ed if they could at least empty trash and bring towels . Nope . I certainly expect more from a Hilton . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was on a work trip during my birthday ; when the hotel staff found this information they made sure to find a way to celebrate with me . Room ##s were very well cleaned and accommodation ##s were excellent . Thank you , Intercontinental ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal multiple times for business meetings and it is always a nice comfortable stay . The beds are really comfortable and the layout and access ##ibility of the hotel are great . Super close to all kinds of great restaurants , shopping and sites to see . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ing to attend a business conference and this hotel was a wonderful place to relax after working all day . I travel often and am particular with service and clean ##liness . Fair ##mont Chicago exceeded my expectations . From the time I checked in . . . to the Gold lounge service . . . to check ##out , all were 5 star . I recommend the Gold lounge . It hit the spot at breakfast and snack ##s / drinks for happy hour . The views are also beautiful from the 15th floor . Ku ##dos to the maid service . . . where they have a turn ##down night service . It was lovely to come back at night with my room radio playing a relaxing tune and the bed all flu ##ffed . I will definitely stay at this hotel when traveling in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed the She ##rato ##n Grand online on the day of our arrival , which caused confusion at check - in because the system hadn ' t updated . The staff worked through the problem and made us feel welcome . As ##signed river - view adjoining rooms on the 28th floor ; nice size , great view . Supreme ##ly comfortable beds ! Club lounge upgrade proved worth ##while , busy at peak times but staff were brilliant . Again , made to feel welcome . Location perfect for Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , rivers ##ide , Navy Pier , The Bean etc . Lot ' s of attractions within reasonable walking distance . Good balance of price , quality and convenience . All in all , a great experience . Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is located in the middle of everything you want to see in Chicago . The building is gorgeous and reminiscent of days gone by . You are 2 blocks from the C ##IB ##C Theater and The G ##rill ##room is across the street from the theater . One word of caution however , do not pick up a can of snack ##s in your room if you don ' t want to pay for them . They have sensors that detect it and you will be charged $ 8 . 00 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is located in a perfect location . It is on a quiet street but just off every corner you turn you are in the mix of Chicago life . Quick walk to Michigan Ave , a quick walk to Di ##v ##vy B ##ike ##s , drug store , Super ##market etc . Te ##mpo cafe is just 1 min walk and they do pretty good breakfast . The hotel is modern and clean . The staff was very welcoming . The lady who checked me in was very helpful . The room was clean with a modern design with a huge bathroom . Maybe even too big a bathroom . So ##fit ##el is great great stay if you are visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You cannot beat the location of this hotel . Near everything ! The room was beautiful with a fantastic view . Love the early morning complementary coffee and chocolate c ##rois ##san ##t . We walked to Eat ##aly for app ##eti ##zer and wine then walked for dinner and music at Carmine ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been reading some of the negative ##s comments before we stayed in this hotel so we don ' t have high expectations but overall so far is pleasant . . Yes the room is very small it doesn ' t even have microwave or ice machine ! ! ! ! But it ' s comfortable throughout four days we stayed in Chicago rain dropped almost every day so the room is cold n the room heat ##er not even warm enough so we had to call con ##cier ##ge for additional heat ##er ! ! ! The hotel is close to magnificent miles Hancock tower and 900 store so we walked mostly which is save us additional cab fare ##s ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room is small but is clean , comfortable bed ( king size under request ) , clean rest ##room . Local ##ization of the hotel is very good , very close to the Lake and to bars , good restaurants and shopping ##s . In a short walk you find the Hancock Building where you can appreciate a great view of Chicago . Also you can easily reach a bus stop for the city tour . We rented a car , but could return it earlier , as the location offers lot of attractions nearby and with the city tour we could visit the museums and main tourist ##ic places with no worries about finding a park lot . Very positive : good bed and location . What was not good : w ##if ##i was not free , very expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My partner and I went on a 5 day / 4 night get ##away for my birthday and arrived at 10 am expecting to store our luggage until check - in time . After changing our room to assure a quiet stay , to our pleasant surprise , Lane ##tte said our room was ready for us , so we were able to settle into our beautiful lake ##view room and subsequently enjoy a full day in the city . Because of the great location , we were able to walk to all our events and sites . All staff were very professional and most ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . Due to the hotel ’ s environmental ##ly friendly practice , we were able to receive a credit of $ 30 . for choosing not to have room service for 3 days . We will definitely stay there again next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We live 30 min ##s away in Oak Park and stay for weekends at the Intercontinental on a regular basis . The location ! The pool ! It ' s freak ##in ' awesome . We joined the Ambassador Club since we stay so often . . . with even more benefits ! : } ~ [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is located in a great area of Chicago with easy access to the lake and parks . I found the beds very uncomfortable , and do not understand why any hotel would use double beds any more . The pool is good , but closes at 9 : 00 pm which is early . The hotel does have character and does have some good views . I would likely stay somewhere else next time as other hotels may offer better value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We found a good price online for this hotel . . . . . however , after grabbing the good price I learned that it was non - re ##fu ##nda ##ble ! This is not a good policy and I object . I will certainly check very close before I reserve again . The Hotel is downtown and is excellent . They have a happy hour in which they give you a token for one free drink at their bar . They also provide snack ##s . It runs from 5 - 8 and is very popular . They also provide a free continental breakfast . . . however you can walk a block to really super restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent accommodation ##s ( comfortable bed , great view of the city ) , good location , and friendly staff . The type of room we booked granted us access to the lounge , which served a wonderful continental breakfast . I highly recommend the Fair ##mont . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have been to many different hotels in Chicago , staying in a variety of locations . Not one hotel came close to the So ##ff ##ite ##l ! El ##egan ##t rooms sophisticated and quiet neighborhood ; excellent spot . We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Chicago visiting attractions closer to this side of Chicago . Will definitely return ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My daughter and I stayed at the Conrad Chicago over the weekend and it was five stars ! The rooms are very clean and new and have a huge TV . The location is right off Michigan Avenue . The staff is very friendly and helpful and make sure you have everything you need . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great location with beautifully re ##mo ##del ##ed furnished rooms . It was so nice having an apartment feel to come home to while visiting Chicago . The location is perfect for anything you want to do in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here 10 / 9 - 11 . Very polite front desk staff explained how things run during co ##vid . I was recognized as an A ##cco ##r member and am ex platinum . We were given a 24th floor king room with a nice view of the Hancock building . Room was very clean with an exceptionally comfortable king bed . Sep ##arate glass enclosed shower and a nice bathroom with s ##ham ##po ##o , soap bottles etc . One robe and two towels were provided with no additional house ##keeping for the two night stay . Extra towels were brought up on request . In room Ke ##uri ##g coffee maker was appreciated . The is a nice outdoor seating casual restaurant less than a block away that is open 7 days a week . Location is con ##vie ##net to walk to most popular dining , shopping etc . We would definitely stay at this location again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Palmer House for business during the weekend and enjoying a rainy Chicago . The hotel is located close to Millennium Park , it ' s a historical building , but rooms are very old and services aren ' t at the level of the price pay ##ed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So ##fit ##el is a nice , clean and well placed hotel . It ' s easy to get to the subway , dining and close to the lake . During our stay , they were filming for the show Empire at the hotel . That was pretty cool . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff in the Gold lounge were so welcoming and at ##ten ##tive ! The breakfast ##s and snack ##s provided were as good as the service , and I felt p ##amp ##ered by the night ##ly turn ##down service . I ’ ve stayed at the Fair ##mont before because of the superb location but will only stay in the future as a Fair ##mont Gold guest . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived to exceptional service . G ##reet ##ed as soon as we pulled in to the circle drive . Upon entering at check - in / reservation desk we were given the best personal attention and care . Thank you to Mr . Julius Do ##xy for your excellent and welcoming care . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our recent weekend stay was wonderful . Lo ##bby was beautiful and had sa ##ni ##ti ##zer available all around . Room was beautifully decorated , comfortable and spacious . Hotel location was perfect access to restaurants , attractions and public transportation . Hotel staff was amazing and gave a late check ##out , incredibly friendly and helpful [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a great trip . The location of our hotel was just off of Million ##aire ##s Mile so super close to shopping and restaurants . Although we were there for business , we took time to go to the Navy Pier and do the architectural boat tour which was definitely the highlight . You learn so much about the history . I strongly suggest doing this . [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a great find , I highly recommend staying at the Talbot ##t Hotel . The staff were welcoming , friendly and went out of their way to make it a comfortable stay . The restaurant and bar were both delight ##ful . I was super impressed and will go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and it was always great . This time it was quite a disappointment . Looks like this hotel chain was bought by a bigger one and now service is terrible . To start , there is no pool anymore . For families with small kids , this is a big one . Then it took 45 min ##s to check in on a sat ##ur ##day at 4 : 15 ##pm . No A ##pologies or try to make it up for all the customers waiting in line . Room was not very clean , we found small things that it was overlooked on the cleaning department . On check ##out day , we couldn ##t even get into our room cause the batteries on the door lock died so we had to call the front desk to have security bypass the issue . We won ##t stay at this hotel again [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose this property to Ce ##le ##bra ##te our Anniversary . Everything was Excellent , we thoroughly En ##joy ##ed ourselves . The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is a Beautiful hotel and they serviced our Every need . We will most certainly return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Conrad is a great hotel . However , we had a bad experience with the restaurant at breakfast . It took an hour to get seated and the restaurant was empty . The explanation was that they were not properly staffed . The cost was high so not a very good experience at all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conference and the hotel facilities were great . I asked for and received a quiet room at the end of the corridor . Bed ##rooms were comfortable and well provision ##ed . Staff were able to accommodate my g ##lut ##en free requests in the on - site dining . My only q ##ual ##m would be the pool was tiny ( not appropriate for swimming laps but adequate for kids to splash about in ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We all gathered after the wedding for drinks downstairs until late in the evening before retiring for the night . . . . . some in the hotel and others a surrounding establishments . Co ##m ##fort ##able , nice people serving and a chance to get out of the busy streets . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you need to be flexible with your trip , don ’ t stay here . Not only does this hotel hold you to the night ##ly rate you won ’ t be using , they charge you an extra fee if you need to leave early . This makes this me ##dio ##cre hotel also a s ##hady hotel . I ’ ll never stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We spent a weekend in Chicago at this very comfortable , clean and class ##y hotel . The rooms were large , the shower ##s ups ##cale and the food in their restaurant very good . It is in a great location . The service was fast and very polite . I recommend staying there without hesitation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The 15th floor had a great am ##eni ##ty , use of the VIP lounge providing food and drink at no additional charge . Man ##dan ##a was particularly friendly and helpful . The room was great , service at the desk and house ##keeping was first rate . I highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was ok but bathroom is relatively small with dim lighting , there ' s no compliment ##ary water despite amount paid for the room . Staff wasn ' t real friendly and did not explain much on the amenities provided , and they are even charging extra amenities fee . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great hotel ! The quality of service is truly remarkable . Room was comfortable and clean and I very much appreciated the location . The rooftop restaurant was closed due to weather , but I did get to try their other restaurant , which was good . Considering I arrived late and ordered from the late night limited menu , I was pleased enough . I wasn ’ t a huge fan of the lo ##bs ##ter roll , but my daughter said her Mac n ’ cheese was the best she ’ s ever tasted . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location . . . . . very helpful front desk staff . . . . rooms elegant ##ly designed for comfort . . . bathroom with all the amenities . . . . major part of a pleasant stay in Chicago . . . . support staff very friendly and willing to help to make our stay even more special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not only is the hotel great but the location is perfect ! When I am downtown I always try to stay ##bat the Intercontinental . Great hotel and close proximity to The Billy Goa ##t and even better Rossi ’ s , an old school dive bar that is a must stop ! I use the term dive bar with all respect to the establishment ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town for large convention , and this hotel was near the headquarters , but far enough away to allow for some peace and quiet . We had access to the Club Floor ( 15 ) , which allowed us to have breakfast in the morning and drinks before dinner . The service there was outstanding . Man ##dan ##a was the hostess , and she is incredible , even remembering our names and what kind of drink we preferred for breakfast . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had stayed at the Talbot ##t many years ago and enjoyed my stay so when I found myself in need of a hotel in Chicago , I decided to return to this one . I was amazed at the difference . It is still a bout ##ique hotel but everything inside has been modern ##ized while keeping the old feeling . The bed was very comfortable . The bathroom was both beautiful and extremely functional . Although our room was small , it accommodate ##d everything . I loved this hotel and would return . Everyone on site was friendly and very helpful . They made us feel as if we were special . There is a small bar and restaurant which were very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was small , but well put together . I am sure we had the worst view , but Chicago ' s green roof initiative made a difference in aesthetics . There is no pool or spa that I recall . The beds were com ##fy and the room clean , but showed some wear . The difficult part for me was listening to my neighbors fight , have sex , or speak loudly on the phone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was superb . Wife pulled a muscle and needed a wheelchair , and Officer Cotton was there in minutes to help . Then produced ice packs as well . Thanks so much ! Hotel also has great food and a market that ' s open late along with Star ##bu ##cks right on the first floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved my stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker ! The beds are so comfortable ! ! ! The girls at the front desk knew so much about the history of the hotel . They told us about the hidden door on the 14th floor and how Al Cap ##one ’ s brother had a speak ##eas ##y on the top floor . It ’ s so cool , a must see if you ’ re ever in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] O ##m ##ni has the most comfortable beds I ' ve ever slept on . The parking , checking and check out were all has ##sle free and the staff were very friendly . I definitely recommend O ##m ##ni and will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Conrad in the old location and the new one is much nice ##r . I came away impressed with the service and the rooms . I would not call it a 5 star hotel but a very nice 4 star that anyone would be happy with . I am a Hilton Gold member and this is in the top 3 Hilton Hotels I have stayed at . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose the Fair ##mont because it allowed us to be close to me ##lini ##um park as well as our favorite breakfast place Wild ##berry Cafe ! The room was clean and comfortable , we loved checking out at noon and having the ability to leave our car in v ##alet until 6 ##pm even after we had checked out , it allowed us to explore without worrying about parking ! Great experience , friendly staff ( the con ##cier ##ge suggested a great restaurant for dinner ! ) This will be our first choice when we stay in the city ( the location is fantastic ) is been the best of the 6 hotels we ' ve stayed at in the city so far . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We could not have been more pleased with the rooms , food and service during our week long stay for our son ’ s wedding . The food and the service at the restaurant are superb and the private Sunday br ##unch after the wedding was great as well . And the lobby was decorated very taste ##fully for the holidays . We would highly recommend this f ##abulous hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My service was outstanding and the rooms were very nice as well . Could use some breakfast in the morning and a phone call to wake me up though . I wish that I could stay longer and see Chicago ! I don ' t have anything else to add just filling this up to meet the requirement of 200 characters . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff , beautiful room and excellent location made this an amazing weekend . We stayed in a corner suite so it was plenty room ##y . Lots of shopping right out the door and most of our U ##ber rides were less than $ 10 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My 15 - year - old daughter and I headed to Chicago the day after Christmas to enjoy the lights on Michigan Avenue and do some shopping . The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was perfect for us ! So close to Michigan Avenue for walking , and the staff could not be any nice ##r ! This hotel was clean and the staff were so helpful when I had a problem with my reservation . My reservation problem was not the hotel ’ s fault , it was Book ##ing . com ’ s error , but the Ki ##nz ##ie staff corrected it for me . I will stay here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Michael Y took great care of us this trip and is extremely friendly and hard working . his lobby cafe has a good selection of specialty coffee ##s , fresh baked past ##ries and fresh fruits . id recommend that you stop in and see him . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a business stay and booked by work - this is a hotel in a great location in Chicago . The spaces are lovely , but very much a business hotel which I think reflects the city . The room was nice - clean and not worn . Not modern or particularly original in any sense but functional and well thought out . The breakfast was excellent but other meals are very much tailored to Traditional fair with not much for special diet ##s , although the b ##urger joint offers a cheap alternative . The problem in recommend ##ing such a place is cost and purpose of stay will be so key as there is no shortage of hotel choice , but I can ' t particularly fault the hotel . Nice touch is as a member of their loyalty scheme ( they knew Event ##hou ##gh I forgot ) I got free w ##if ##i in the room and compliment ##ary water . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Listen , is the Palmer House going to win an award any time soon ? Probably not . It ' s a standard 3 star Hilton , relatively clean ( the bedside tables were a bit dusty , though that ' s probably because I was in a room that was in ##f ##re ##quent ##ly stayed in ) , small bathroom , paint p ##eel ##ing a little , and not a great view . And the lobby - it ' s grand and beautiful . The front desk is du ##ti ##ful , friendly , and gets you on your way . It ' s a hotel that won ' t make an impression on you besides that wonderful lobby . You can do better in Chicago , though this hotel with a m ##od ##ic ##um of work , could be restored to its former f ##abulous glory . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoy staying at the Palmer House , it just feels special when you walk in the lobby . The location is ideal for us and close to public transportation . We were lucky to get an upgrade and the suite was lovely . They are currently doing some renovations to the ceiling in the lobby and looks as if the pool will be renovated as well . We liked having breakfast in the executive lounge , which provides a quick , sufficient breakfast . We did almost miss breakfast on Sunday , as it was closing at 10 am , we thought breakfast would be open later on Sunday . My only complaint is that every time we have stayed , the lines for the front desk are always so long . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Too ##k my family here for our traditional Thanksgiving / X ##mas Chicago downtown ex ##cursion . Location is within walking distance to Due ' s , greatest deep dish pizza you ' ll ever have . Love the warm and home ##y feeling as well as amenities provided . Hard ##ly anyone took advantage of the great pool on the 19th floor with a view . . . . simply awesome . I look forward to my return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Price ##s were acceptable , service was kind and helpful , and a quiet place at night . The room was big and spacious . The beds were very comfortable , air conditioning was nice , and the views were incredible . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked the Fair ##mont as friends recommended this particular hotel and we ' ve had excellent experiences at other Fair ##mont properties . We arrived on foot , as we ' d taken the E ##L from Midway and ended up on Lower Wake ##r drive . We entered via the lower level of the hotel and the staff mi ##s ##dir ##ec ##ted us to non - working es ##cal ##ators . Check - in was ok and check - out , 4 days later , was again , via a staff ##er so bored it felt as though we were interrupting his solitary inter ##lude by asking to have our luggage held . In between , the room was superb and the amenities just lovely . However , the in ##different attitude at arrival and departure left a poor impression . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was normally a Mar ##riot ##t person until we tried a Monaco in Denver . That stay was outstanding so we tried the one in Chicago . We were not disappointed . The service was outstanding . The staff was very friendly and helpful . The room was very nice and spacious with tall ceilings . It looked like new . It also has a great location for walking in the downtown area or using public transportation . High ##ly recommend this place . We will definitely be back here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ing for meetings and the location is great . Close proximity to restaurants , the lake , park and retail . Reason ##ably priced and the service is solid . They have coffee downstairs in the morning and it ' s to first hotel I ' ve been to which offers ice ##d coffee out of a bottle . ( Love ice ##d coffee ! ) if you are a runner there are really good runs starting right outside of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would definitely stay at this hotel when I ’ m Chicago . Great location and excellent service . The staff was very kind and helpful in every way . I would recommend staying at the Mill ##eni ##um hotel to friends and family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the hotel for a conference . The hotel is a short walking distance from lots of the attractions in downtown Chicago . The room was nice . However , the w ##if ##i access was a little weak . My roommate kept losing his connection and when you are trying to conduct business that is not acceptable at the rates we were paying for the hotel room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a pleasant stay and they were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . One of the big reasons why I booked this hotel is because of the great location and I was not disappointed . Chicago is a beautiful city with a rich history that I was happy to experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love the Palmer House . Its been my GO TO H ##OT ##EL in Chicago for many years ! Grand Lo ##bby En ##tra ##nce and a style that feels like its the best Hotel in the world . Great [ people from the Door G ##reet ##er to the Maid , the hotel staff is among the best in the city . EA ##S ##Y ACC ##ES ##S to the best parts of downtown for shopping , theater , art and museums . M ##US ##T ST ##A ##Y L ##OC ##AT ##ION ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our company stayed here for a week for a conference . I pre ##pa ##id all the rooms in advance . Everything went as planned except 3 boxes shipped to us couldn ' t be found . I showed the front desk the delivery confirmation but they still insisted they were not there . The next morning , I went looking for them again and a manager brought them out of the fed ex store since the store was closed . Shuttle pick up was right out front , rooms were clean and comfortable , lots of restaurants in walking distance , also a bowling alley and movie theater , Whole Foods etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not quite the Millennium experience you ' d expect but also consider it ' s an iconic building so more " old " than " modern " . . . staff friendly enough in a very casual manner . . . room size quite acceptable for a city hotel but can feel cramped if you have large suitcase ##s . . . elevators were a pain and used the stairs instead ( 4th Floor ) . . . for the location , we certainly got a good rate . . . will probably stay again on next visit . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , lovely staff and its a room that you want to be in while on a little vacation with family . . . The lo ##cat ##io was right in ##front of shopping mall , restaurants and a walk away from Navy Pier e ##ct . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a convention , its a convention hotel , bathroom had mold in the seal ##ant around the tub and to cap it all off , I looked into my in room coffee maker and it had water in it , so I dumped it into a glass and it was grey and full of floating things , took the glass down to the front desk and left it with them . Don ' t touch any thing in the snack tray unless you are willing to pay $ 9 . 00 a peace for them and don " t leave the in room fridge door open too long or you will be charged for the articles in there . Close to one of the canals and walking distance to other restaurants . Room ##s are small but quiet . Plan a day trip to the Museum of Science and Industry its worth seeing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a Hilton Honors member so I try to stay at Hilton ##s when I travel . This location was great but everything else not so much ! House ##keeping had to be called several times a day to clean our room , throughout our entire stay Con ##cier ##ge and Front Des ##k never answered the phone and the price for parking your car was un ##real ##istic ##ally high . While I understand the cost for parking is likely non - ne ##got ##iable I don ' t understand why guest services including the front desk , the con ##cier ##ge and House ##keeping were so un ##att ##ain ##able . It was very annoying . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the first Bon Jo ##ur upon arrival to the final Au Rev ##oir when you depart you ' ll be glad this was your home away from home during your time in Chicago . The entire staff , and I mean everyone , makes you feel welcome and important and your every need is well taken care of . I would specifically like to call out Peter at the con ##cier ##ge desk for his many years of wonderful service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room had two bathroom ##s and I found out about half the rooms in the hotel are the same . Very nice added benefit and very nice hotel . The pool closes early though ( 9 ##pm ) so plan accordingly . We enjoyed our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This venue is great and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting for an excellent party ! . I had an Up ##sca ##le Chi ##c party and L ##yn ##sey made sure it was that and more . All the staff was great and helpful especially D ##wayne who made sure we had everything we needed to make sure the party ran smoothly . My guests were app ##re ##cia ##tive and I was extremely impressed ! Thank you again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff ! Reno ##vated suites ! Very spacious accommodation ##s . Staff went out of their way to move us to a room with better view and sunlight . We ’ re staying 5 days over Christmas and needed the sunlight . House ##keeping kind and helpful . T ##ruly a delight to stay here . Got a great rate via Ex ##ped ##ia . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From start to finish this hotel exceeded our expectations . Would definitely stay here again . Close to everything also ! Staff was extremely friendly . Room ##s were neat and clean . S ##le ##pt so well on the com ##fy bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great property . Gold Room is superb . Man ##dan ##a in the Gold Room is the e ##pit ##ome of what a staff member should be . Maid and turn down staff are exceptional . Staff members are always smiling and willing to assist you with all of your needs . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I came into town for a play . This is our second time staying at the Conrad and it was wonderful . It started off a little rough when we arrived for check in at 3 p . m . and we ' re told the room was not ready . My recommendation would be to make sure the rooms are available when your guests arrive and if there not at least apologize and maybe offer them something for the in ##con ##ven ##ience . The room was nice and clean and the staff very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting I would highly recommend staying at the Conrad when in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved this hotel ! I felt like a queen staying here ! It felt very p ##osh and very relaxing . I loved the de ##cor and extremely spacious rooms and high ceilings . The staff were delight ##ful ! The view from my room was a brick wall but I didn ' t mind too much since I was here for business . I would most definitely stay here again ! My only concern was that the door locks didn ' t feel sufficient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Many of our family members went on Thanksgiving day for two nights . Great pillows , quiet and extremely clean . Can ##t wait to go again . We intend to make this an every other year tradition . We had great rates too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was very friendly and helpful . I was treated like a queen . Restaurant had great food . The room was clean and had plenty of amenities . I definitely would recommend staying here . Walking distance to shopping and the River ##walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for two days and it was in a great location for walking down the magnificent mile for a spot of shopping . Room was quite spacious and comfortable . The only let down was the poor service in the bar . Two people in our group ordered the same drink at the same time and got different results ! Plus a number of other small details and writes just proved there is work to be done on improving this aspect of the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay at H ##ya ##tt Regency . Room was clean and prepared . arrived early and was allowed to check ##in . great location to downtown and river ##walk . local transit available . My particular room did not have a fridge or microwave ? several bars w / food and a coffee shop available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Intercontinental is a great hotel - - walking into our room we were w ##owed ! ! My daughter is pretty quiet but she was so excited about being there . Great experience great staff . Love ##d the location of the hotel to the Navy Pier and downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel with a nice view . Restaurant ##s on site . Extreme ##ly clean and the staff was nice . Will stay again . Close to restaurants and the theatre all within walking distance . U ##ber and taxi right out front ! So convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the H ##ya ##tt for a business meeting / conference . I loved the abundance of extra seating space they had around the hotel for imp ##rom ##pt ##u meetings and / or have a conference call . The rooms were clean and comfortable . It was very easy to get to restaurants around the city - both walking and via taxi . A great place ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice and the service was fair . The rooms are dated , could use a good renovation . The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean . I would try another hotel next time , not very worth it for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here last minute through Hot ##wire for $ 145 plus tax . We upgraded to the top floor for $ 35 more dollars per our son ’ s request . Our room was very close to the Presidential Suite . There was not a pool , but a nice work ##out room . The v ##alet allowed us to keep our car parked there until 6 ##pm even though we checked out at noon . Vale ##t was $ 72 . They kept our luggage In a safe place while we walked around the city . The beds were comfortable and our room was fantastic . Would definitely stay here again . Our v ##alet even got us ice for our ice chest when we left . Everybody was very kind and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 3 nights here and thought it just perfect . Friendly staff and good service . The rooms where clean and were kept im ##ma ##culate with the daily service . The bar area had a good atmosphere with good seating . High ##ly recommended to anyone going to Chicago . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Had ##n ' t stayed here in man years due to no pool , so forgot how much I like this hotel . Nicole at front desk made the stay even better and is the kind of staff that makes you want to return . Great views with large windows to see lake , river , Navy Pier , but street itself off Mi ##ch a ##ve , so quiet . Only a few blocks to the nearest beach . The con ##cier ##ge on July 27 was also very helpful because go ##og ##le maps has fl ##aw that gives bad directions to the closest beach which I noticed ; he already knew and showed how it was only few blocks to take a cooling swim . Work out area on 43 ##rd floor also beautiful views and nice machines , clean . Walk ##able to Mill Park , Mi ##ch a ##ve , train station , will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is well located , two blocks from Michigan Avenue and nearby several excellent restaurants . The rooms are comfortable and quiet and the bathroom is adequate . The staff was friendly and at ##ten ##tive . I enjoyed my stay here and would consider it again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Hotel , Great Location , Very professional and Guest friendly . Was here for all star weekend and despite the crowds and numerous activities going on The She ##rato ##n Grand was on point . everything you need is in the hotel and within walking distance , there is a whole foods , a movie theater and numerous restaurants a block or less away . i really enjoyed my stay here and with the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile and other attractions within walking distance this is the idea location . Jeff ##ery from the front desk was amazing as well at check in S ##hout Out to Jeffrey . [SEP]
1	[CLS] You will get wonderful staff and service on the highest level . Hotel looks amazing from the outside and it is on a great location . However , the rooms are not worth the value , and in the winter days were very cold with no possibilities to heat them up , as the cold air was constantly coming in from the windows . Swimming pool not as presented on the website . G ##ym was small but nice , however you could see the frost on the windows and the door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hotel has plenty of seating / sofa ##s all around the Hotel ! it provides a very relaxing atmosphere all through the day . The location is absolutely fantastic right by the River walk ! Reason ##ably priced as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the Home ##wood Suite ##s is just perfect . St ##roll out and be right in the thick of it with all the shops , restaurants etc near by . The suite was decent , I believe it had been newly renovated ( although didn ' t seem like the lounge / diner had , just the bedroom and bathroom ) . See ##med we had a spacious bedroom & bathroom but the lounge was so so . I am also de ##duct ##ing a point as I specifically called ahead to ask them to have the sofa bed made up but there was no record of it . When we asked they told us that house ##keeping had gone home for the day ( this was around 4 ##pm ) . That said , for the price would recommend this place to those visiting Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] You know you have found a g ##em when you are consistently surrounded by smiling , happy guests and friendly , helpful staff . The amenities were exactly as described and the location is excellent . My only personal issue was the noise of the A / C , but only because it had to run constantly due to excessive heat - a bit noisy , but I was definitely enjoyed the comfortable cool environment . Strong ##ly recommend a stay at H ##S Chicago Downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying at a Kim ##pton property and we were not disappointed . Every single employee was so friendly and helpful , despite being very busy . The spacious room was clean and well stock ##ed . The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds we ' ve slept in . My favorite part of our stay here was sitting in the window seat and watching the world go by down below . What a view ! The only negative during our stay was dealing with everyone using a single elevator because the other one was broken . We will definitely stay here again and will look for other Kim ##pton properties when traveling . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here for a one night stay en route to Green Bay . Check in was easy but there was a bit of a hard sell on an upgrade . The hotel is H ##U ##GE ! The rooms were good enough for one night - not quite as good as She ##rato ##n that I stayed in , but better than others . Good facilities in the room and quick and easy check out . Good location a few yards from Buddy Guys Legends [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent Custom ##er Service ! ! The entire staff is really great . So friendly and smiling like they are truly happy to see you . A plus is that the hotel is B ##EA ##UT ##IF ##U ##L ! The rooms are so comfortable and very clean . The only place I ’ ll ever stay in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This resort is a great location for families coming to enjoy the great weather and country . The employees here , like my friend Rosen ##do , are very friendly and they offer a great variety of activities to do on the fine Sandy beaches . To anyone who wants a vacation in paradise , I highly recommend you come to Para ##dis ##us Palma real ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not even C ##L ##OS ##E to being worth the money . Find another way to park your car or use U ##ber . Park ##ing at hotel is $ 70 ! ! ! Hotel very hard to find using G ##arm ##in . It takes you to the street level B ##EL ##OW the hotel and then you have to circle around along North Shore Drive and G ##arm ##in takes you right back to lower level ! Called the hotel and they talked us th ##ru the traffic back to E W ##ack ##er Drive . Con ##cier ##ges were very helpful . That was the only highlight . The first bill they slid under our door had a $ 110 charge that was totally strange to us . Called accounting right away and the girl seemed to be “ put out ” that she had to fix , re ##print and get me another bill . Room was average , clean but not to the $ 200 + expectation . We will not be putting ourselves through that “ experience ” again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This property was a perfect place for a mini reunion . The location was excellent . The property itself was clean and comfortable with spacious suites . The compliment ##ary breakfast was excellent . Service was top notch . All in all , a great find . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My son and I had a four day weekend in Chicago and we chose the Conrad based on the reviews . Location is excellent - just off of Michigan avenue . It is G ##RE ##AT . Don ' t stay anywhere else . The staff was very at ##ten ##tive - you can text them if you need anything , and it arrives in your room with a smile . The cafe food for breakfast was great ( warm c ##rois ##san ##ts for breakfast ) and the room service was perfect and delicious , every time . Our rooms were large and comfortable , with super co ##zy robes and slip ##pers . We will not stay anywhere else - and neither should you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Intercontinental for a short family Stay ##cation . We visited American ##G ##ir ##l Store and walked our way back to the Intercontinental - a do ##able walk for my 5 and 7 year old - the location of the hotel in Michigan Ave . provides any shop ##per multiple opportunities to s ##co ##op up deals or window shop along the way . The pool at the Intercontinental is a major plus . With not many downtown hotels with indoor pools , this am ##eni ##ty sealed the deal for my family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : Great location in the very downtown of the city , blocks away from several landmark places , good interiors quality , nice environment . Con ##s : Too noisy , I can hear next door t ##v clearly . Tiny rooms . El ##eva ##tor takes a life to arrive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My fi ##ance and I booked a room at this hotel back in June of 2020 for February 202 ##1 . We specifically chose a room rate that allowed for free cancel ##ation because we weren ' t sure what the CO ##VI ##D situation would be . In December 2020 , we decided to cancel our trip , because the pan ##de ##mic was still raging . It is now February 19 , 202 ##1 , nearly two months since our cancel ##ation confirmation went through , and we have yet to get our money back . Every time we call to in ##quire , we are told to call back between 10 ##pm and 6 ##am . When we do that , we are told that the money is on its way . After about 20 rounds of this game over the past two months , we still have not received the money back . At this point , the hotel is essentially r ##obbing us blind . We are seriously considering legal action at this point ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby and rooms are ni ##c ##ly renovated . The lobby seems to have kept most of the original style while the rooms have been updated to modern style . The only down ##side is they do not tell you up ##front you have to pay for parking . So what seemed like a great deal was just ok in the end . $ 70 for parking one night is outrage ##ous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Class hotel . Bo ##uti ##que feeling . You have to try the cheese p ##latter at the bar a phenomena ##l deal . Staff is excellent . Great attention to detail . Newspaper and coffee every morning with past ##ries . We will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Around the hotel there was good security and those guys were polite , friendly and efficient . The same cannot be said for the Re ##ception staff . I needed $ 3 for the left luggage and as I was on route back to the UK I did not want to get more currency . It ended up costing me £2 ##6 at their AT ##M for the $ 3 charge ( cash only ) . I had to use it as check out was 11 ##am , not the standard 12 : 00 . I asked Re ##ception to charge $ 3 to the room to give me the cash for the service . They said the left luggage was noting to do with them so use a AT ##M , even after I explained I did not want to pay for more US currency - most un ##hel ##pf ##ul . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Be ##ware of surprise end of stay . don ’ t touch the bar accessories . If you move something from counter for 30 seconds , it will appear on your Bill . We removed a few things to put water in . Then there is the 15 . 00 resort fee each night . If you have br ##unch , don ’ t tip , as it will appear on your bill . 137 bill at end . Best mattress ##es . Great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel to stay in for a trip to Chicago for either business or personal . Their service and high tech hotel rooms are very nice . Gold members get free breakfast and great walking location to almost everything . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . We had a lovely room , wonderful amenities and excellent service . Stay ##ing s ##t the So ##fit ##el for our 34th anniversary made it a memorable and special weekend . We will certainly return before our 35th anniversary ! Thank you to the f ##abulous staff at the So ##fit ##el , Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located perfectly . Although the physical plant is just a little above average , the hotel gets my 5 star rating because of the outstanding service and attitude of the employees and management . Wow , there is nothing that they won ’ t do to make you happy . Lauren , at the front desk , is a g ##em . Jo ##van is really good . It takes a special type of general manager to m ##ot ##ivate their employees to be this helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . BT ##W - the breakfast was just so - so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Public because a dear friend died and his family reserved a block of rooms there because of the proximity to family and the church where the memorial service was being held . The front desk could not have been more supportive . We had no complaints about anything . Public Chicago will be the first hotel we call the next time we journey to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was at the Dub ##ble ##cross in the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel was having a bad evening an then I had a drink but the best part of the whole evening what the bar tender j ##osh the experience was great W ##IL ##L CO ##ME ##BA ##C ##K ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel was perfect for location in the heart of downtown Chicago . Steps outside were the only thing I noticed that needed attention to cleaning . Room ##s were comfortable and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The robe in the bathroom was a nice touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] my husband didn ' t ask high floor so we stayed 10 th floor for no view but ok I don ' t see out side . If first time to get room from there site I really recommend to apply membership first . You can have w ##if ##i for no charge . Usually charge around $ 15 . Also They charge gym for $ 40 this time that is out of budget so we just said no need gym I know room is big . I just bring yoga mat for do yoga in the morning . that ' s ok room has space . Also Bring some water or juice . they have tiny fridge . Room is big but room is kind tired . They have really nice renovated hotel around but this old but well maintained hotel for few days feels like princess ! ! Thank you for great night [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel is perfectly located in downtown Chicago . The rooms are clean and the entire hotel staff are extremely friendly . Each staff member always tries to engage you and ask if you have any needs . They genuinely want you to be happy . We enjoyed our stay and felt welcomed from start to finish . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for one night and had a great stay . A ##rri ##ved early and the reception ##ist realised I ’ d travelled a long way and kindly let me check in early so I could rest . Room was clean and spacious with great views of Chicago . The rooms are old and probably could do with an upgrade and lick of paint but that didn ’ t at all dim ##ini ##sh that it was a great stay . The location is right next to the Chicago River and a easy walk to all the main areas of Chicago . De ##fin ##ite ##ly would recommend staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The front desk staff was friendly , professional , and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The room was spacious and had great views . It was a great one night stay ##cation in the city . If there was one down ##side , it was the price of parking . We ended up parking in a garage next door for a third of the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a room ( # 71 ##5 ) with a river view and I could have sat in the window seat all day long ! What a genius idea ! Room was large , bathroom was huge ! and everything was very clean . We even got a gold ##fish for our stay . Great location - close to everything and easy to catch and U ##ber in front of the hotel . I will certainly stay here when I return to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived late in the evening due to delayed air travel and were welcomed with a warm smile and friendly front desk woman , tall and blonde but did not get her name . The room had a great view of the Navy Pier and River . Room was clean and quiet . What made this stay special was the service delivered by Nicole T . I had issues with the UP ##S Computer ##s attempting to print my boarding passes and left my cell phone at the front desk . She called our room stating she secured my phone until I was able to retrieve it . That is what I call customer service . That made my day and visit . Nicole and all other staff we encountered were exceptional and I will return to this hotel on my next visit to Chicago . Thank you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here while in Chicago for Hamilton . Very s ##ty ##lish , European look hotel . Love ##d the lobby area ! Our room was decent sized and the bathroom was very nice and large . Our bed was luxurious ##ly soft . We were on the 10th floor which had a somewhat limited view so would request higher floor in the future . My only complaint was that v ##alet parking cost $ 71 which was over half the price I paid for the room on Travel ##zo ##o . Should have self parked right next door but it was rain ##ing . Had breakfast at the hotel restaurant , Cafe des Architect ##es . Very s ##ty ##lish and good meal at typical Chicago prices . Would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was great , nice location . The only thing I had a hang up on was the key for the mini bar did not work . I tried to lock it and the lock would not take . Room 141 ##8 Also , when I ordered breakfast , I would always have to ask for a room service door card and gave up . I ordered breakfast with o ##at ##me ##al , milk , O ##J & Coffee . The 2nd day I was there - only received milk . no O ##J or CO ##FF ##EE ! U ##G ##H ! Had to drink the conference coffee - which is not good . Otherwise - the house ##keeping was wonderful ! I told them that the pen in my room to write with was leaking and they replaced it . Room was always re ##f ##resh ##ed after having a long day at meetings . It was relaxing and fun . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel on the river front is H ##U ##GE . Clean rooms . nice lobby , easy in and out underground parking , nice cocktail bar , great service , and a nice room great price ! Quiet , comfortable hotel , within walking distance of some great bars and fine dining . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful room , great location , helpful and welcoming staff . En ##joy ##ed our stay very much and able to walk to all downtown areas we wished to visit . King Suite offered both east and west views of lake and river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Very busy hotel . + $ 500 for the night . Date ##d and disappointing suite . Upon check In I was handed two bottle of water which pretty much sum ##med up the amenities . Four Seasons or Trump Tower next time . . . . M ##J ’ s steak ##house was ok . Maybe I need to lower my expectations . Again , location was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our third stay at the Fair ##mont Millennium Park and just as great as the other visits . The hotel is attractive and the rooms very comfortable . We were given a room with a great partial - view of Lake Michigan . I love the location of the hotel as it ' s right by Millennium Park , so perfect to get out for some exercise . Also , very easy walk to the Art Institute of Chicago , and many other downtown locations . I did miss the N ##es ##press ##o machines that were formerly in the rooms but I ' m sure Co ##vid - 19 had something to do with their absence ! The staff was extra ##ord ##ina ##rily kind and warm . Vale ##t parking was expensive but worth it for us and the v ##alet ##s were really on top of things . I felt the prices in the lobby breakfast bar were quite reasonable for a hotel restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The guest room we had was poor for the price . The bed was not comfortable at all . There were cracks in the ceiling , the bathroom floor was stained . Also , there was no coffee maker , which we expect at a hotel of this price point . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel exceeds expectations on every level ! From the beautiful rooms ( that come equipped with window seats big enough to sleep as a twin ! ) to the ma ##rve ##lous staff . Every need was accommodate ##d and each door ##man remembered my name . The food in the restaurant is excellent ( try the blue ##berry pan ##cakes for breakfast ) and the upper dining area looks out onto a great view of the fantastic architecture of the city . If I come back to Chicago , this will be the hotel for me ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was super clean and very large with excellent views of the mile and good walking distance from lots of activities . Easy access for U ##ber and l ##y ##ft . Excellent service and friendly staff . Large old school pool and excellent room service . Very comfortable beds and excellent shower ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Regency for a conference where I was presenting . This hotel is one of the best where I ' ve ever stayed . Everything was top - notch from the food ( restaurants and in - room dining ) , house ##keeping , A ##V and business center staff . Every single person I encountered was court ##eous , professional , and performed their jobs with al ##ac ##rity . By the end of my stay , I was kicking myself for not spending an extra evening there for pleasure . I ' ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel ok rooms noisy work ##men outside the room from 8 ##am putting up s ##ca ##ff ##old . Bar staff ok but one man in particular treated us very badly . Food good not a big menu but expensive . Only one lift for 16 floors . Small hotel near shops but I think there is better value elsewhere [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful room , nicely furnished , soft linen ##s , very comfortable bed . With all that said , the shower was by far the crown jewel . Fantastic water ##works , spacious with shower and bath ##tub in the same enclosed space . The lobby area and elevator look a little worn and out ##dated but we soon felt like it was part of the charm . There was a Bud ##wei ##ser convention going on so we got a chance to view the space for meetings and the food offered , it looked very good and smelled amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is one of my f ##ave hotels in the city . I love the new space and it ' s quite larger than the former . Check out the amazing bar and Wes ( bartender ) is fantastic ! I love the sofa ##s and the sitting area . The drinks are y ##um ##my and fun . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago is a historical landmark and the hotel does show its age . Nevertheless , it ’ s location is ideal for getting about downtown . You can still enjoy walking through the park and the lakes ##hore without the sea of humanity which is usually in millennium park on North Michigan Ave . Chinatown is a few minutes away by U ##ber , you can walk to the Art Institute and museums , also still close to the shops . This hotel is for those who want to avoid the multitude of tourists as you step out of the building . Despite its age , the Hilton Chicago provided clean rooms and bathroom ##s , and wonderful amenities and services . [SEP]
0	[CLS] During our recent visit to Chicago , my wife and I attended a banquet over dinner at this hotel and found it to be of a high standard be ##fit ##ting the name of She ##rato ##n group . The sit in banquet was very well organized and the service was of high standard . Many friends were staying at this hotel and were very satisfied . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for one night as part of a business trip in May 2017 . It was a very plus ##h hotel and very nice . Great lobby , great rooms and great bar / restaurants . The room was spacious , the bed was very comfortable . The bathroom amenities were fantastic , especially the shower gel ! I had a room with a view of Lake Michigan and Millennium park which was nice ! The location was great with lots of places that are walking distance from the hotel . Even a C ##VS across the road . Great value for money and would stay here again for sure ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came for business but we extended our stay cu ##z we had so much fun . the service at the Talbot was te ##rri ##fic a room was wonderful and the hotel is a lot of fun . It was 96 in Chicago for two days straight yet our room was so comfortable and cool . The staff is amazing and they go out of their way to make your stay comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice hotel , but for a Fair ##mont , they need to update some of the rooms . I saw a few p ##ics in the gallery of ta ##ttered benches / couch ##es in the room and I ended up getting one of those rooms . The other amenities in the rooms were ok . My friends room was better than mines , but I think this hotel is ready for some updates to match the Fair ##mont quality and standards that I ' m use to . Still not but bad , but I think the rooms are a little dated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel seems OK . The staff was friendly . You have to pay for everything extra . For internet you must pay extra . I can get free internet while I am buying my $ 2 coffee and not at this hotel . There was no iron or iron board in the room . Could not iron my shirt for my meeting ! I like the Kim ##pton hotels but this one does not come up to their standards . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At ##tended business course in July over the weekend and from Mon to T ##hu . Hotel is in a great position in downtown area . Off ##ered upgrade to gold club that included powerful breakfast , daily app ##eti ##zers , honor bar and evening desert ##s . Staff in gold club lounge are very experienced and professional . Hotel needs some up ##dating in terms of furniture and technology . Some of the hi - tech equipment is being updated right now . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Sit ##uated in a very central location this is an ideal hotel to stop and spend a few nights in downtown , it may not be the cheap ##est hotel but the staff were very helpful and the location is excellent . Check - in was quick and simple and we had a very well appointed room with a good view and a very comfortable bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was here for a week long business meeting and truly enjoyed the hotel . The gold upgrade was definitely worth $ 45 extra a night - breakfast was excellent es ##p the eggs Benedict . Al ##co ##hol was not included . The only complaint was the walls were thin and I could hear my " neighbor " singing every morning and evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel a lot to Chicago for work - this is by far one of my favorite hotels . It ' s easy walking distance to the river , Navy Pier , Ma ##g Mile , and my office . The environment is fresh and bright , the service was wonderful and the place is just beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at this hotel . It was very clean , re ##mo ##del ##ed and the staff was great . The manager ' s reception in the evenings was nice with beer , wine and snack ##s or app ##eti ##zers . In the mornings the free breakfast b ##uff ##et was con ##vie ##nent and never too busy . The location was fairly close to everything we wanted to see and do . The rooms each having full kitchen ##s was very nice with the kids . The only draw ##back I could find was the elevators seemed very slow or very busy . I liked the hotel a lot though so I ' d wait for the elevators and stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont is an ok hotel in Chicago - good location and the rooms are big , however the overall amenities are just ok - if you need anything i ##e just a shower cap you have to ask . B ##UT the win ##ing formula for my weekend was their con ##cier ##ge Gail - she was AM ##A ##Z ##ING . Help ##ed us out multiple times , came up with great restaurant recommendations , plus made multiple time changes for us . Thank you Gail - you helped el ##eva ##te our stay at The Fair ##mont [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fun , easy to check in and out . Great rooms , great location . Harry Cara ##y ' s Italian St ##eak ##house is right across the street . Breakfast served b ##uff ##et style right in the lobby area on your floor . You get two token ##s for the 6th floor bar when you check in . Try the sign ##iture drink , silver cross . Have been here before will absolutely go again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is in a great , central location in the heart of downtown Chicago . The room was clean and comfortable & I had a great view of the Chicago River . The room slept 4 , but there were only 3 sets of towels which I found to be odd . Since I was traveling alone , it didn ' t affect my stay . The walls did not seem to be entirely sound ##proof as a conversation in the next room woke me up early in the morning . Overall , a pretty enjoyable stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel has everything expected of the Conrad level of the Hilton Brand ! R ##oof top is spectacular on all levels , including food and beverage ! B ##UT , if you are staying on the Michigan Avenue side of the hotel ( was up - sold and charged $ 30 additional a night ) you will be woken up throughout the night due to Sir ##ens , ho ##nking horns and construction ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located within walking distance of several The Bean , Art institute , Buckingham Fountain , theaters , river trip tours . A ##pp ##ro ##x mile to Field and She ##dd . Stay ##ed executive level which gave you breakfast and happy hour food which was enough for dinner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Working with the staff to arrange our s ##ym ##po ##sium was sea ##m ##less and effort ##less . We worked with Lauren Tim ##mer ##man , Convention Sales Manager and Tyler Du ##p for the room booking ##s and both were su ##p ##ber ##b to work with . Lauren met with us th ##rou ##go ##ut the 2 days to make sure we were all set and even came in early on Saturday to make sure ever ##thing was to our satisfaction . I would not hesitate to hold another s ##ym ##po ##sium or event at the Swiss ##ote ##l . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really a great place . Wonderful stay with rooms renovated full of any con ##fort . Located in one of best Chicago position is really la ma ##ison to stay in Chicago . De ##fin ##ite ##ly to come back . Outstanding breakfast too [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful stay at the " new " Conrad location . This was our third stay since it opened . Wonderful hotel , g ##rac ##ious staff , and fantastic location . Near many of the best restaurants in the city , one half block off of Michigan Ave . Best hotel we have found in Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel was super clean . It was quiet and co ##zy . Was there for my boyfriend ' s birthday and it was perfect for a quiet night . Staff was nice and friendly . Breakfast was ok , but did not offer much for those who don ' t eat meat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a smaller ( 50 ) business event in the Swiss ##ote ##l . It was a wonderful experience . Working initially with Veronica for the event and Caroline for the A / V portion , both made the pre - meeting and day of requests ( of which there were several last minute minor changes ) to the actual day of event , with Josh for A / V and the f ##abulous Mar ##bina as our Ban ##quet server ( Peter Ramos , take note ! : - ) along with the AM stew ##ard who ' s name I didn ' t catch - - overall AL ##L of the people who were on the event , even if re ##fill ##ing the water , were all top notch . Very professional , very pro ##mpt for any changes , requests . . . Can ' t say enough good things . Thank you AL ##L ! ( My room service the night before was A + as well . . ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the first time I visited this hotel in the late 1990 ' s the key ##word is consistency . They are always first class and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting beyond belief . True customer service is their number one priority . Many other brand hotels could learn from Swiss ##ote ##l . The moment you check in customer service begins . Not only for pleasure but Swiss ##ote ##l provides incredible venues for special events . The weddings I have attended there are incredible . The W ##ack ##er Drive location offers views of Lake Michigan that are breath ##taking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They do everything right here . The staff is dedicated to making sure that everything is perfect , the facilities are top - notch , and the location is super convenient . The views are great from any side you stay on . The Mariano ' s is pretty close and they have anything you need , [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Staff was friendly and pleasant . Location is perfect , right in the heart of the city and Ma ##g Mile . Room was clean and appropriate but nothing over the top . About 3 blocks from the train station so options are p ##lent ##iful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed on Gold floor for 6 days . Breakfast was excellent , am ##bie ##nce was very good . Man ##dan ##a who supervised morning breakfast service was especially friendly , helpful and at ##ten ##tive to all our needs . She was outstanding in recommend ##ing activities , providing maps and directions and taking care of our needs . Room ##s are clean and spacious . Did not try hotel restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The 1 bedroom suite in this lovely part of Chicago is very room ##y and felt like home . I love the beds and the snack drawer is second to none - if that ' s what you are looking for in a hotel room . : ) I love the old feeling of this hotel and the bar makes great coffee and great cocktail ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I absolutely fell in love with this hotel and the staff . We arrived a bit earlier than check in and were greeted by Alex who was so welcoming and quickly got us into our room . She went over the hotel amenities of free breakfast on certain floors as well as the evening cocktail hour . We attended cocktail hour with our drink token ##s and the signature quickly became our drink of choice . It was really good . Our room was nice and clean and the elevators were fast . The hotel is in a prime location within walking distance to almost everything . We would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice , spacious & very clean rooms . Love the window seats ! This is not just another hotel - it has character & charm . Very friendly staff . Great location & decent price . I joined the rewards program so I was able to get free w ##i - if . I come to Chicago for work often - hope to stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pen ##d a few more dollars and enjoy your trip to Chicago . . This is a great hotel . . . . . and a great location . . . . The rooms , staff , service levels , all exceptional . . . . The rooms are a few dollars more but s ##p ##lu ##rge . . . it was less than 50 . 00 more than a Hampton Inn ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for New Year ' s day to avoid some fierce Chicago weather and travel . But this is not my first time at this hotel , so I knew what to expect . I was happily greeted by Ely ##dia Q ##uin ##tana , one of the several preferred hostess ##es behind the front desk who check people into their rooms . Ely ##dia was kind enough to upgrade me to a higher floor facing the John Hancock building . . . . . I love the southeast side of this building . My stay was te ##rri ##fic as always . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed ##ding ( especially knowing it was - 30 ##F degrees outside with wind chill ##s ) . Spa ##cious bathroom ##s with marble floor ##ing , soaking tub , walk - in rain shower . Nearby shops , grocery , restaurants make this a lovely choice in Chicago at any time of year . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed here while visiting friends in Chicago , room was super modern and cool - stayed here for 3 days . It ' s walking distance to the main drag of downtown Chicago , it also has a phenomena ##l restaurant called the P ##ump Room . My husband and I celebrated an engagement dinner here with a group of friends and the chef made some special app ##eti ##zers for us . It ' s p ##ric ##y but absolutely worth the experience of dining in a Chicago institution ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Let ’ s start with the plus ##es ! This hotel is in a great location , right across Michigan Ave from Grant Park with easy lake access . I had miles of trail to run and felt safe alone , even before sunrise . The common areas are grand , well maintained and full of history . I had a great view of the Willis tower from my room . There are plenty of elevators with rarely a wait . The rooms here are just . . . odd . Whoever cut the modern foot ##print out of the old hotel floor plan certainly was creative ! Some rooms have an extra bathroom . My room had a strange cut - out for the third window . Just . . . odd . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t was a perfect place for our weekend get ##away in the city . We enjoyed the close proximity to all of the dining , shopping and sights ##ee ##ing on Rush and Michigan while also being able to experience the charming neighborhood feel of the Gold Coast . Our Junior Suite was very spacious for a city hotel and the staff were warm and welcoming throughout our stay . We can ' t wait to come back and highly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We appreciate the staff , the heavenly beds , and view at the So ##fit ##el ! It ’ s close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping district and we listening to the jazz right across the street at T ##ru ##luck ’ s . It ’ s also a couple of blocks from Eat ##aly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed ~ 2 weeks in September , 2016 : # Location : A # Custom ##er Service : C - . . . staff at the lobby & front desk very poor , almost non - existing # Breakfast : same everyday . . . frozen stuff & un ##hea ##lt ##hy # Room : Not sure what renovation they talk about . Basic furniture . More space though if you stay longer which is a + # Did not feel the hotel is secure and safe . Anyone can get in . Not returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , walking distance of all attractions , next to Eat ##aly , close to original Un ##o , G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s etc . Only thing which makes little sense is that the bathroom is in the bedroom , so your kids have to go through the bedroom ; - ) nice corner suites . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was amazing especially the restaurant 720 South . They were very nice and had amazing customer service . I would definitely go back to that hotel and restaurant ! Jay was especially great . He always made sure my group and I were well taken care of ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I choose this hotel again because of the great service I received last year . I ' m glad I did because my wife became ill after a night out and Ms Kay was on duty . She was very sympathetic and suggested a couple of drug stores in the area . I was very impressed with her knowledge of the area and the events going on in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in was a fast and easy . Room was very clean . Bed was soft and views were fantastic from the 28th floor . The location is fantastic . They full ##fill ##ed a special request for me that was outside their norm , and I really appreciate it . Eric helped us hail a cab back to the airport . He along with the rest of the staff was cu ##rt ##ous and helpful . I would recommend staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Connie Alex , Ruth ##ie , and the staff at the lobby bar and 33rd Floor lounge are the best . I notice these staff ##ers have been at She ##rato ##n Grand for many years . I ' m so impressed with their great hospitality and ability to remember returning customers . Hotel is in the heart of Chicago and very close to Navy Pier . If you come to the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago , ask for Ruth ##ie in the lobby bar and Connie Alex on the 33rd floor lounge . They will treat you like VIP . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This establishment needs to seriously get it together . We booked two rooms . My group came at different check in times . First party checked in at 3 : 00 and they did not have the room ready until 4 : 00 ! Second party checked in at 4 : 00 and they did not have it ready until 4 : 30 . Check in time is 3 : 00 ! For a bout ##ique hotel that has been around for awhile , you need to step your game up significantly considering there are so many other hotels in Chicago . And to be quite f ##rank , I ' ve actually always gotten lucky and been able to check in and get a room B ##EF ##OR ##E check in time at majority of hotels I travel to . Also the beds were listed as King beds which we selected and they appear to be queen beds instead . Very disappointed and do not recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] James Jenkins was AM ##A ##Z ##ING . There were times that our group really depended on him for changes and he came through with pro ##mpt ex ##ac ##usions of asked for items . High ##ly recommend this facility with James team excellent performance . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room was spacious , very clean with delight ##ful amenities . The staff was wonderful . I would stay at the Talbot ##t again on my next trip to Chicago . The bar is a won ##de ##ful place to sit and relax and the food was great . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing room , staff always acknowledged us but the room had no mini fridge . We paid for an upgraded room and were sad to find out the only f ##rig in the room was the mini bar which we could not use . One was offered to us but we had to pay an extra few to have it in our room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic location when visiting Chicago . Minutes away from Millennium Park , easy access to public transit , and close to Michigan Ave . Hotel is very nice - we had a great view of Millennium Park from our room . Room was a good size , large bathroom , and clean . Bed ##s were comfortable . The rooms are a little dated , but when your not spending a ton of time in your room you don ' t really notice . Check - in and check - out was very easy . Staff were very professional , and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been at Ambassador for a medical Congress with a group of doctors , so I had many questions and many needs for my guests which have constantly and kindly been satisfied . The reception is efficient ( thanks m ##r V ##idal , you work very well ) as well as the waiter ##s at morning breakfast , all professional and kind ! But a special “ thanks ” goes to the very kind gentlemen at bell door , especially m ##r Wayne but Ryan , Lu ##ís , Grace and James too , Who followed my needs always with a kind smile . The rooms are nice , the beds very comfortable and the hall is co ##zy and elegant . Good position very close to the Ma ##g Mile but in a relaxing district . Hope to come back soon V ##ero good hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed here 4 times , but never on St Patty ##s . What a great view to watch the river green ##ed . I was a little surprised to learn that I ##H ##G purchased the chain we love . I hope they keep them the same ( gold fish are gone already ! ) . Gwen at the front desk was super nice , helpful and particularly funny ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] St ##ren ##gth ##s Design , location , v ##ibe , bar , room comfort , most service . Ryan , you made our stay more special , We ##ak ##ness ##es G ##ym way too small , front desk under ##sta ##ffed and very slow at check - out , elevator broken , halls dirty . The food choices in the Library lounge were average . The $ 67 / night v ##alet charge is too expensive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Quite sophisticated hotel in Chicago downtown , in a very good position to walk through the Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile as well as the main attractions in the city center . It is a modern style hotel , clean and in order , basically it is worth the cost . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We enjoyed staying in Chicago as a family get away . This hotel was a big part of the very positive experience we had . From the check - in to the check - out we felt valued . The room was spacious and well appointed . We loved it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were meeting out - of - town friends in Chicago , and we picked a great location . The hotel was close to public transportation , restaurants , and the river walk . The room was im ##ma ##culate and quiet , and the staff along with the front desk were friendly and helpful . We loved our quiet room with a window seat , great view , and a comfortable bed . We would definitely go back to the Monaco again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Great staff . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions were clean and comfortable . Only in ##con ##ven ##ience was that they were up ##grading the elevators so only one worked , but that should be temporary . We Would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Spot ##less and spacious room with a view of the John Hancock building . Love ##ly staff . High ##ly recommend and will be choosing So ##fit ##el hotels in future for vacation . Great for a Chicago break . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff are friendly . The room is clean and we ' ll appointed . The location is perfect for sight seeing and business . The room we were in was looking a little dated and could use a re ##f ##resh . I would recommend the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All the staff are really nice and friendly . Originally Hotels . com screwed up our reservation date , but Kali ##n and the manager Marcus went above & beyond but correct ##ing the problem by changing our reservation to the correct & they even upgraded us to a Suite without anymore additional charge . Just this alone made our stay in Chicago really great ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you like big , busy , fun hotels in big cities this is your place . Location is great to walk anywhere downtown . Very easy walk to Mill ##eni ##um Park , River Walk and Navy Pier . Room was com ##fy but bathroom is small ( not much counter space ) Chicago is expensive . . . having said that , we spent $ 85 including tip on 4 cocktail ##s in the Big Bar but they were G ##RE ##AT cocktail ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only stayed here for one night as we were passing through Chicago , although wish it would have been longer . We had an awesome stay at the hotel , room was clean and spacious enough . Ke ##enan at the check - in counter was great ! Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] 1st visit to Chicago and chose Talbot Hotel . Couldn ’ t be more pleased . Staff went above and beyond to make stay as safe as possible during Co ##vid . Restaurant was not open but they partnered with Butler and provided what I thought was an extensive menu avail ##ed for delivery . Located in an ups ##cale neighborhood . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We have stayed in several hotels in downtown Chicago before . Monaco Chicago has the best location and best service . We got stuck in the downtown traffic for a couple hours before we got to the hotel . The staff were very nice to our family and gave some welcome gifts to cheer them up while we were waiting . We had a blast time in Chicago . My 9 year old daughter told me she wanted to be a hotel host when she grew up after the trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a conference nearby and stayed in this hotel . Much preferred over others in the area . Glad I received the conference discount ##ed rate . Downtown Chicago hotels are out of my price range generally , but with the discount , this was one very fine stay . A lot of character and great customer service . Amazing location and views from a 30 + floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were greeted by Shelley on reception who was extremely friendly , we were given an upgrade to our room . Our room was amazing , lounge area , good sized bedroom and j ##ac ##uz ##zi bath with a rain shower . Tea and coffee making facilities were in the room and plenty of toilet ##ries and towels in the bathroom , it was a f ##abulous room . The hotel is in a great location , plenty of restaurants and shops nearby and near the hop on / off bus and Oak Street Beach . All the staff were friendly and helpful , the con ##cier ##ges were very helpful . Had breakfast on our last day , it was very good and not much more expensive than anywhere else . Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First off , we ' d go back . No hesitation . Good hotel . Great location . If you dig around , you can probably find a nice price . Nice staff . Nice v ##alet . Good room . We were in town for a girls lacrosse tournament . S ##pent a night in the ' b ##ur ##bs . Dec ##ided to head into town for dinner at the Shanghai Terrace . Wanted a nice and easy place to stay . K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker totally fit the bill . Just be prepared . $ 68 . 00 to park the car . Yo ##w ##za . That ' s some spend ##y parking ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time to this hotel . Best location . Walk ##able to almost all tourist area . Had issues in getting the adjacent rooms however staff ##s were helpful and cancelled my other room free of penalty when I could not get close / adjacent room [SEP]
1	[CLS] Too ##k my girls to the Palmer House for a birthday trip and the hotel was incredibly welcoming . We s ##p ##lu ##rge ##d on a suite so the teens had a separate bedroom and it was a blast . Lots of fun stuff to see nearby , good deep dish pizza just down the street at Pi ##zano ' s , near the museums , walked to the architectural tour on the river , etc . Location was perfect . Co ##m ##fy beds , good food in the restaurant , fun hang in the bar ( lots of weddings going on ) and an overall wonderful trip . Our shout out to the staff who made us so welcome . One tip : They do not automatically provide coffee makers in the room , you need to request the day before . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was comfortable and the service in the first floor cafe was great . I especially enjoyed the French past ##ries and Earl Gray Tea . The gentlemen in the lobby took care of my bags , the check in was efficient , and the bed was turned down when I arrived in the evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad in Chicago lives up to its name , great location , lovely rooms and indeed a luxury hotel . We had some issues with our room , only managed to get in 2 ##hr ##s after check ##in ( due to the room not being ready ) but we were compensate ##d for that with $ 60 . 00 credit which was enough for a snack and two drinks on their roof top bar ( level 21 or so ) Besides that , the rooms are absolutely gorgeous , spacious ( around 450 ##s ##q ##ft / 49 ##s ##q ##m ) , the house ##keeping was helpful and on time , every day . Overall a great experience , cannot wait to return to Conrad . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent Easter here and were pleasant ##ly surprised : from the smooth check - in to the friendly staff , convenient location and co ##fort ##able rooms . All of that at a competitive price compared to the hotels of the same standard in this area . The neighborhood is not very lively ( shops , offices , hotels and upper class dining ) but n excellent starting point to discover Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was nice to stay at this hotel for location and services . Food was good but needs improvement as ha ##lal items may also be served . Staff was cooperative . Had some problems with bill ##ing . Front desk people were good but still needs some improvement [SEP]
1	[CLS] Five Star Service . The Grand Dame of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . What an institution ! Love ##ly , spacious rooms . Perfect amenities . Close to the finest shopping & restaurants in the area and all right outside the front door . Would stay at no other hotel in Chicago Can ' t wait to go back ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location and incredible staff . The rooms are very comfortable and well equipped . You will be a block from the John Hancock Center , where there is a Big Bus tour stop and the area is surrounded by shops . Ask for K ##wa ##me at the front desk , he is definitely the best ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was my first stay and will not be my last . I enjoyed the art work the gym facilities and the king room . I didn ’ t like the small bathroom and how the tub floor popped while shower ##ing , but such a small thing in the greater scene . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The check in was slow and our room was not ready at 4 : 30 ##pm but once we arrived at our room all was fine . The room was clean , fresh and bright with warm com ##fy beds . Room service was pro ##mpt . We enjoyed our stay very much ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] from checking in ( thank you Eva ! ) to checking out ! wonderful staff , very helpful and everyone who assisted on our meeting planning , waiter ##s ( thank you Leonardo ! ) very pleasant and professional willing to help . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great value , friendly people , and comfortable rooms . All went well until check ##out when I wanted a late one , and a kid behind the desk said after 2 ; 30 I would be charged . I had been there for 9 nights . I asked " how do you think that will go over ? " . . . his reply was simply " well at that point its no longer about you " . Total ##ly took me back . . . but other than that stupid comment by obviously a new ##bie , great stay . Service at bar outside a little slow . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was excellent as was the service . No issues with our stay and would stay there again . Room ##s were clean and staff was at ##ten ##tive to needs . I like swimming and they had a lap pool so I could swim which was a bonus [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located near the 360 and just off the magnificent mile . Well appointed and comfortable rooms Friendly non pre ##ten ##ti ##ous door staff . Nice walk in shower Ke ##ure ##g in the room . Good w ##if ##i . Near high end shops if that ' s your thing Next time I might consider across the river by the art institute . It seemed a little funk ##ier with more choices of cheaper restaurants . But I really have no complaints except could have used a coffee bar in the lobby [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is great , walking distance to the lake and to many other places rooms and bathroom ##s are very good But what really matters is the great staff they have , all of them really helpful , specially Kay , she was the best ! ! I need extra help and she was on top of it and did a wonderful job , she is one of a kind They should work on the breakfast , which is terrible , very simple things can improve it totally , again the staff helps to go through a bad breakfast will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having visited many hotels in Chicago , I rank this hotel near the top for the hotels found in its lower price point . The location is wonderful - a close walk to downtown , the lake and to Lincoln Park . Located within an older building , the lobby is beautiful . The rooms are very clean and modern . The bathroom ##s are large and nice . The bed is co ##zy . The hallway ##s and elevators are old and could use an update . All of the hotel staff I encountered were kind and consider ##ate and professional . A comparison to this hotel would be the Talbot Hotel and Hotel Lincoln and I do prefer this hotel to either of these . For the great rate , the hotel is a win . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a long weekend in Chicago . The hotel was ideal ##ly located , clean , staff was friendly and family options like the pool , free breakfast , and a separate room for the kids was great ! We were able to walk to most attractions and nearby restaurants were great . We will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was excellent and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , but they had a lot to make up for . Small rooms where you hear your neighbors . We had to move due to ya ##ppy little dogs in next room . There is no kitchen , so if you want something later at night you have to order delivery from a small selection of fast food joints . You may find sandwiches at bar , but it closes at 11 : 00 ##pm . Mini bar in room is well stock ##ed at over - in ##f ##lated prices . Free coffee in the morning , but breakfast is next door and price ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Way over ##p ##rice ##d ; didn ' t give us the room that we reserved months in advance ; ended taking a hand ##ica ##pped room ; too late to change hotels . It was convenient for a short stay . Daniel ##a was court ##eous , but couldn ' t help much ; parking was very expensive on premises ; in my opinion , as a priority card ##holder , we weren ' t taken care of very well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] O ##m ##ni Chicago Hotel is located in one of the most famous North Michigan Avenue , downtown Chicago . The competition to be the best here is mouth ##water ##ing as all top brands are here . But O ##m ##ni , uncommon as the name may sound , won ’ t di ##sa ##pp ##oint you . Had great time in my suite s ##po ##ilt of amenities . My advise , if you ’ re visiting Chicago , and want value for your money , and want to change from the more ordinary brands such as Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal , H ##ya ##tt , Court ##yard , Mar ##riot ##t , try O ##m ##ni and you won ’ t be disappointed I at ##test . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Price was great and location is perfect for shopping . Service was so - so and staff was somewhat cold and in ##att ##ent ##ive . The rooms are ok but minimal . OK if you want value and good location . I stayed at Trump after this and it was a completely different service experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a newly Conrad Hotel in Chicago for several years now . It ' s a very nice hotel and good for work - related functions - Save place to rest , good shower , warm room , comfortable bed . I had stayed here several times whenever I traveled to Chicago for work . I enjoyed the breakfast restaurant but it could be improved . The room was small for the amount of money paid . I don ' t think it was value - added given my status with Hilton hotel . I don ' t recommend this hotel unless you are desperate to find a luxurious hotel to stay at in high season . The staff ##s here should be educated to learn more about what it is like to work at a high - end hotel . The staff ##s sometime could be clue ##less , un ##ima ##gin ##ative , and entitled . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve lived in the city of Chicago for years and I ' ve never stayed downtown Chicago . There is limited , but plenty , parking . It took us six levels to find a park . Check in took a little longer than expected . If you ' re not a hilt ##on honors member , become one today , it ' ll save you time . Room ##s are nice , staff are friendly and helpful , and hotel is clean . The Lake ##view room was nice . We got a view of the She ##dd and Navy Pier . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Being here for a conference , I found the hotel confusing and under ##w ##hel ##ming . Bath ##rooms in room were small and b ##land . There were no lights to turn on when entering the guest room , but instead I had to walk around to a desk lamp . No room view , the ##rm ##ost ##at set at 66 , holes in the wall ##paper and comfort ##er . Not impressed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] very classic feel and great location . steps from j ##oh ##n ha ##nco ##ck center and magnificent mile . highly recommend for a short or long stay . star ##bu ##cks across the street , what more could you ask for in a home away from home ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ed with my husband for business . Amazing staff and property . Room ##s are small but co ##zy as clean we were there for a few days could of used less mini ##bar fridge and more room for left ##overs for our delicious pizza . Location is convenient to everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel right off Michigan Avenue with a great staff - good food and lovely outdoor seating area . Bed ##s are very comfortable . Although they have a gym , we went to walk the lake since the location was perfect . Many restaurants within walking distance [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro is a beautiful old hotel that Kim ##pton has / is re ##fu ##rb ##ishing . The rooms were nice and there are some beautiful historical touches that have been maintained . The location to to the theater district and downtown is ideal . We we also there during the strike which is not a reflection of how nice this hotel is . [SEP]
1	[CLS] staff are very helpful , rooms are so ##oo ##oo spacious , beds are comfortable . Great location for anything you want to do or see in Chicago . Jo ##in the loyalty program for free w ##if ##i , and coffee and newspapers in the morning and more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We haven ' t been to Chicago in awhile and decided to visit for a few days and stay at an old favorite - - The Talbot ##t . What a delight . The Talbot ##t is better than ever . The red ##o is well done ; the staff continues to be awesome - - hats off to D ##wan ##e for being so helpful and the location is perfect for a nice al f ##res ##co dinner on a beautiful non humid Chicago evening . We will be back and hopefully sooner rather than later . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great experience at the Home ##wood Suite ##s on Grand for our 11 day work trip this fall . The service was great - front desk was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , we enjoyed the evening receptions , the rooms were spacious and clean . We had wonderful service from the v ##alet ! Am ##er ( v ##alet ) was especially helpful ! He knew we needed our car every morning by 7 : 30 and it was there and ready by 7 : 15 , seat warmer ##s and all ! He always greeted us with a smile ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a beautiful place . A grand lobby welcome ##s you and you know right away that it is historic . The customer service was great - very at ##ten ##tive . My room was good , not great . It was clean and very comfortable . Room ##s aren ' t very big , but this is Chicago . The bathroom was a little too small . They should remove the self service snack ##s in the room and provide a small fridge for guests . Very good location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly service ! Many restaurants within walking distance . Q ##ua ##int hotel , perfect for a get - away weekend . Nice rooms , could use a little more closet space . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will be returning to this fine hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , extra com ##fy bed . No shower phone in the bathroom . Whilst the restaurant is being renovated , there are no delivery options offered by the hotel . P ##lent ##y of restaurants nearby though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This downtown hotel has an interesting history and stories . Great location ! Staff is nice and helpful . Meeting space was perfect for our group of 150 . The only thing I wish they offered was room service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are very clean , quiet , comfortable and the location is great for walking to most places you ' d want to see in that part of Chicago . The continental breakfast was good - lots of choices ( nothing hot except what you put in the toast ##er ) but fruit , past ##ries , cereal and yo ##gu ##rt were fresh and good . You also get token ##s upon check in to use for a drink at the reception area in the evening . The staff is friendly and they were able to a ##cco ##mo ##date any question quickly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a plain corporate / convention hotel . The beds aren ’ t comfortable , house ##keeping doesn ’ t show up until mid afternoon and the request I made to re ##ple ##nish the mini bar went un ##ful ##fill ##ed . The location is good but there are much better hotels in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed here several times in the past 10 years . . . always a wonderful stay , we had a great view , upon request , so very clean , our maid . Was darling and helpful , and Noel , the door ##man / Bell ##man was the best , and genuinely helpful and friendly . All good at Swiss ##ote ##l , Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean hotel and nice location . It is a comfortable and friendly place to stay . It is also near various bus and train routes , which made it easy to get around town . We enjoyed our stay and I would definitely visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Friendly service . John the door ##man was the best to deal with . Friendly and helpful throughout our stay . Din ##ing options are solid . Location is just off the river walk which makes for many other dining and shopping options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is beautiful . I stayed in a standard double room which was very large ( it even had two bathroom ##s . . . which is explained by historical past ) . The service team was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . There were a number of small stores and restaurants in the hotel including a place to grab a quick breakfast snack or lunch called Herb N S ##pice Which sold Star ##bu ##cks . Walking distance to Yo ##lk and 30 minute walk to magnificent mile . . . or a 10 mi U ##te can . The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is due to Hilton Brand Ambassador ##s trying to convince you to sign up for a time share ‘ free ’ vacation . They were too aggressive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for two nights with our cat and they were nice enough to let us check in early and they upgraded our room - to one with window seats for our cat to have a view . The room itself was very large , a little older in style , but with very comfortable beds and a large bathroom . A few small con ##s - the room was dusty , I found someone ' s ear ##ring near the side of the bed , the hot chocolate was empty in the lobby and when they brought more it was cold , and they need to provide blankets for sitting in the window area when it ' s cold . The pro ##s - great staff at the front desk , the door ##man from Boston was very nice ! The evening reception is a lovely am ##eni ##ty . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt was in walking distance to the River Walk & lots of shopping and food . The only trouble I had was getting around within the hotel . I stayed in the west tower & all my meetings were in the east tower . I had trouble finding my way around . Big place , but everything and everyone was very nice . The food was great with lots of amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A beautiful old hotel that has a wonderful location . The hotel is located near the L and the train . Just take the blue line in from O ’ Hare or the Orange line from Midway . All of the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly . We had a quiet , spacious and spot ##less corner room . We liked the elevators that went to specific floors ex ##ped ##iting trips to your room . The beautiful lobby bar has wonderful cocktail ##s and is the place to sip and relax after a day of visiting Chicago . This hotel is a block or 2 to Hamilton , the Art Institute and Millennium Park . It is within a 20 to 25 s ##tro ##ll through the park to the She ##dd A ##qua ##rium and Field Museum . You can hop the CT ##A bus or L to most anywhere in Chicago . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Reason ##ably appointed Hilton suites in downtown Chicago . E ##asily located within walking distance of several great eat ##eries and the staff is very pleasant . Conference rooms very tight and toast ##y . Travel ##ing for work . Not the most comfortable hotel beds or bed ##ding so that was a bit disappointing . The rooms are clean and my hall is quiet . Park ##ing is $ 34 / night , about 40 minutes to airport [SEP]
1	[CLS] I arrived at the main door and there was no bell ##hop to take my bags or any luggage cart . I had to l ##ug my 3 suitcase ##s to the front desk , which was just a huge pain . Staff was friendly , but come on . The room had hair lying around . Also , I was disappointed that breakfast wasn ’ t included . Not sure what modern hotel does that anymore . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In my recent stay at the Intercontinental , I was delighted by the comfortable furnishings and great service provided by hotel staff , whether it was the door ##men , lobby staff , or even house ##cle ##ani ##ng . The location is hard to beat - great options for dining and cocktail ##s right in the hotel or on the streets everywhere just outside the door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What great service ! K ##wa ##me was a huge help ! What a beautiful hotel . Our room was originally under a name where there was a similar guest . Chu ##m fixed that immediately and made sure we were ok . The con ##cier ##ge also made sure we knew everything in the city that was fun to do . Love ##d it [SEP]
1	[CLS] They do not or at least did not have anyone at the hotel entrance to ins ##truct guests to come to the 20 th floor to the lobby . They also do not have any sign ##age to send you to 20 to find the lobby . They charged me for the compliment ##ary w ##IF ##I , $ 19 and I was not even in the room to use it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie was very clean . recently renovated . Room was nice with comfortable beds . Free breakfast just outside the room was great , with an actual good selection to choose from . Staff was friendly . Location is excellent just over the river off State St . Close walk to everything . Michigan Ave . was less than a 5 minute walk away . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a conference . The place is very big , but the staff are wonderful . Every time I would stop to try to figure out where I needed to go one of them would be there to point the way . Very friendly and helpful . The rooms are very clean and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , perfect for show and shopping . Came in on Amtrak , nice way to travel . Used U ##ber several times , very enjoyable . People were friendly , will visit Chicago again . Hotel room on 19th floor was next to elevators so had a little bit of white noise to deal with . Had two bathroom ##s , which the wife liked so it was a wash . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff , clean rooms great views . Break ##fe ##ast b ##uff ##et in downstairs restaurant terrible . Good location . My corporate team and I had a pleasant walk to Benny ' s . The room was comfortable and modern . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am very sorry to say that this hotel and its staff does not care at all about the global trash problems . All plates , glasses or table ##ware they use is all plastic to throw immediately away . All the breakfast serving ##s , E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING , is plastic to throw away . When asked about it , they just say they are not equipped otherwise and it is perfectly fine to create tons of new waste everyday . It is amazing that a hotel still thinks this way in 2019 - i will never stay here again till they have solved this issue for good . The only way to ask them to change is to show them that people do care about the environment and I will stay at hotels who do work accordingly [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love going to this bout ##ique hotel for a nice little get ##away . Recent re ##mo ##del keeps everything modern and elegant . Service is great and D ##wayne the door ##man knows all the hot spots to hit . The bar has a nice little wine list as well [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was top - notch . The rooms were im ##ma ##culate . Be aware that the mini bar items are charged on weights , so if you move them around , you may still have to get the charge removed . Very strange con : they were somewhat sting ##y with T ##P . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for a meeting in April 2019 . Great location right on Michigan Avenue . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed , but pillows were lump ##y and towels were scratch ##y . Good water pressure . Am ##ple plug ##s at bedside . Small room . easy check in and out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hand ##y to several restaurants , Nord ##strom ’ s and of course a Star ##bu ##cks . . . . The rooms were adequate but nothing exciting . Any downtown provides noise , sire ##ns off and on all night . Then as we are headed out on Friday a pick ##et line was very annoying . Staff were nice and I would try here it again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was so happy that I chose this hotel for my visit to Chicago . Everything about the hotel was fantastic . The room was spacious and beautiful . The staff went out of their way to accommodate my needs . I recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 15 floor is where you will fine some great staff to help with your stay - from recommendations to best way to get around the city . If you need any toilet ##ries - just asked . Man ##dan ##da makes a perfect cup of la ##tte for my breakfast ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got two rooms . One with a king bed which was great . The other with two beds . The room was fine , but the beds are tiny . No way four people can share a room w / those beds . The location is amazing . . . if you at visiting Chicago and plan to walk , stay here . However , if you have a car , parking is $ 71 a day . Very price ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] W ##orse experience ever . R ##ude check in Dirty and s ##hab ##by suite Technology device usage limited Forget about i ##Pad or laptop charging few electrical outlets to use W ##IF ##I access limited unless daily fee paid . Poor ##ly equipped rooms Bath ##room prehistoric Bed sits almost to floor . No Box spring and lump ##y Overall Just awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is nice - with the park view . This was a grand hotel with a lot of services which are just not there anymore . They have re ##f ##resh ##ed the rooms and that makes it ok but have to say . . . . it is just ok . Not what I look for in a H ##IL ##TO ##N hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location and decoration are very good , very safe to get around even at night time , also convenient for dining and shopping . Service is excellent ! One of the newest hotels in downtown Chicago . Breakfast is not bad [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve always loved the Ki ##nz ##ie for its bout ##ique charm . The q ##ua ##int , free happy hour was a great first stop before a night out . Breakfast was set up in the elevator lobby on each floor , a home - like walk from the room in a robe and slip ##pers . Now the happy hour is without mixed drinks , just beer & wine . The breakfast has been moved from the elevator lo ##bb ##ies to the 5th floor making it less convenient . Why do hotels eliminate the things that make them unique ? Guess I ' ll have to look for an alternative that isn ' t looking to go " generic " . I hope management reads this and re ##thin ##ks ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] What an amazing stay here in Chicago ! The hotel staff were as ##to ##und ##ing and went above and beyond . I stayed here to celebrate my boyfriend ##s birthday . From the moment I stepped out of my car , I was greeted by the most friendly door ##man , Charles . Check in was a breeze , and Emily was so incredibly helpful with recommendations . Chris and Vince both ensured I had a pleasant stay as well . Also - John at the bar was so incredibly friendly . I cannot thank this staff enough for the most wonderful experience ! I will definitely be coming back here : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] After a rocky start to a recent stay , I stopped by the front desk and spoke with Joshua who was able to turn things around and make the remainder of my stay what I had come to expect as a frequent guest of the Swiss ##ote ##l . Joshua was helpful , pleasant and honestly the only reason I will be willing to give the Swiss ##ote ##l another try when I need a hotel in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would highly recommend The Talbot ##t Hotel . Perry and all the staff at the Talbot ##t were wonderful . They were very friendly and helpful . Room ##s were nice size and very clean . Excellent location . Pat ##io dining and bar atmosphere was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No v ##alet parking even though the phone recording says they do . Dark rooms , AC could be better . No hotel bar . The Talbot is close to everything . Nice neighborhood . Just . Little short . Could use more mirrors in the main room . More towel hooks in the bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for two nights at this hotel and were very impressed . Hotel was very clean and comfortable and it was evident that it was well managed . The room was clean and well maintained . The staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The v ##alet / bell ##man were very helpful in loading and un ##loading luggage and the location of the hotel was great . It was a 15 minute walk to navy pier and a 15 minute walk to millennium park to see the Christmas tree . Lots of great restaurants nearby as well . Would definitely recommend staying here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed my stay and accommodation ##s . The staff was super friendly and helpful . This location is walking distance to Macy ’ s , Ford Theatre , and multiple other locations . The rooms are a bit small but that is expected for a hotel this age . The renovations are very arts ##y and beautiful [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a lovely stay at the She ##rato ##n while attending a conference at Navy Pier . Ku ##dos to John T ##iri ##til ##li of the bell staff - thanks for being so friendly and helpful ! Chicago at its best . Co ##m ##fort ##able room and beautiful view . Walk ##able to do many great summer locations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the She ##rato ##n Grand for a weekend in Chicago with our dog . The hotel has a great pet policy - dogs up to 75 pounds are welcome as long as they are never left alone in the room . It was a beautiful weekend so we had no problem finding plenty to do outside . The rooms themselves seem like they are a little over ##due for a re ##mo ##del , and the property is massive which could be a turn off for some people . But the location , lake views from the room , and pet friendly policy mostly made up for these short ##coming ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good morning , I had the pleasure of speaking with Chelsea Perez at the Intercontinental hotel . in Chicago . She was most helpful with answering questions and helping me and my family ’ s upcoming visit . I was on the phone for approx 30 min ##s . We looked at different options for my family stay . She recommended a room and rate based on famous needs and we booked it . I ’ m very happy and will be using her again for any future stays or events . Thanks again Chelsea for the hard work and effort to help me find a room best suited for my family . Since ##rel ##y Ross W . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall a more ups ##cale experience and a good value , but a few things were bother ##some . Reno ##vations were ongoing and we couldn ’ t nap during the daytime . The sheet set had an i ##cky stain on them , and the bed was old and not comfortable . When you pulled back the blanket the bottom sheet ( they used flat sheets for the fitted ) came with it so you had to remake the bed . It was an old bed that seemed to lack the promised pillow ##top and was very small for a queen . Show ##er and s ##ham ##po ##o , toilet ##ries provided were excellent . Bar was very nice as well . The hotel is very old so that created some issues like tiny slow elevators and noise through the door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , staff and even though the room was small it was super - clean and I would take that over any size room any day ! Will be back for sure ! Did not try the restaurant but there were a lot of local people there so that ' s a good sign ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Friendly staff made sure we had everything we needed for a wonderful stay in the Wind ##y City . The room was magnificent , with river and lake views . I certainly hope I get to travel to Chicago again soon , and when I do , I plan on staying at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This well - located hotel was very pleasant due to its small size which gives it an intimate feel unlike the giant big - city hotels where you feel so anonymous and lonely . Our room was very spacious for downtown Chicago and very well appointed . . . loved the floor space , twin sinks , and nice toilet ##ries . The lady who checked us out was very g ##rac ##ious and welcoming , as were the bell staff also . I highly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly staff from the moment you walk in . Room ##s are decent size . Two t ##v ##s . Wet bar . Des ##k to work . Co ##uch . High ##ly recommend if staying downtown . The room cool ##s down and warm ##s up quickly . Big windows with a city view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to Chicago for two days / one night for our anniversary to see the Singer Sa ##rgent exhibit at the Art Institute . We took the train in so wanted a hotel close to Mill ##eni ##um Station and walking distance to the Art Institute . My sister - in - law said they usually stay at Kim ##pton hotels so when I saw that the All ##egro fit my requirements I booked it . Am I glad . Upon arrival , Shea was so helpful in ensuring we had a very nice , quite room . The hotel has a prose ##cco happy hour in the lobby , which was a great start to our evening anniversary dinner . Will definitely stay here on our next Chicago trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] location is perfect , close to c ##ta grand station , bus from navy pier stops in ##front of the suites . mall ##s , rest ##os and g ##ro ##cer ##ies all around , magnificent mile just a short s ##tro ##ll away . you cannot ask for more . . . Super ##b kitchen and dining amenities also with coffee bean coffee maker and tea . ne ##ut ##rogen ##a toilet ##ries , daily house ##keeping , free w ##if ##i and more . . . High ##ly recommended . . . value for money ##cho ##ose corner room for a nice view and larger living area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here because of a prior stay that was pleasant . Upon arrival the hotel tried to place us in a double room , although we had booked a double double ( 2 beds 2 baths ) . We had to show them the paperwork as they didn ' t believe us . Still they sent us to a double and then doubted us when we came back and told them . Then they said it was the room we originally booked ( not true which I again showed them ) . Total bad attitude from the desk staff . Once settled into a room , we found it to be dusty . Over ##night our fridge froze all the food inside . The next day they said they fixed the fridge but again it froze all of the food . They did provide us with food coup ##ons so that was a good response . One of the bathroom ##s took 3 flush ##es each time you used the toilet . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed with my husband who was in Chicago on business and I needed to work while we were there as well . The Ki ##nz ##ie certainly scored high on work ##ability with free w ##if ##i and a great desk area . Pro ##s : Location - - close to great shops and restaurants . The room was a good size and had a great closet and a com ##fy window seat . Great bathroom and robes as well . The in - room refrigerator was a plus as was the amazing breakfast and evening happy hour . Con ##s : No sheer d ##rap ##es on the windows so it was either shades drawn and dark or shades wide open and no privacy . Also because of the location there was no amazing view of Chicago . We would certainly stay again without hesitation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly & a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , comfortable and spacious room , bed very comfortable , well appointed with amenities . Quiet room from other guests and heating / cooling fan , nice exercise room , great value , good location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a phenomena ##l hotel ! Amazing location and such a wonderful hotel . Room ##s are renovated , com ##fy , and clean . Our room had a neat view as well . Melissa and the rest of the staff are friendly and top notch , and they clearly work very hard to ensure all guests have a great stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent experience . The hotel was very nice and the con ##cier ##ge was excellent with all the service . The cleaning service however only came to our room once in a 3 night stay . I would still highly recommend the location of this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The lobby is so nice . The room was okay . The bathroom ##s are very nice . The bed is okay . It is good for business . They have a nice bar . I would say this is a 4 star , however . It is a great location , however . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Do not under any c ##ir ##cum ##stance stay at this hotel . . I was given the room key to two different rooms that were occupied by guest ! Room # 42 ##1 and # 102 ##0 . . . . were both occupied by other guest ! The hallway smelled like a cross between urine and death ! What a disappointment . I went across the street to the Drake and was treated 100 times better . . . . I have over 100 post on trip advisor and I must say , much to my ch ##ag ##rin this is the worst hotel experience of all time . Not to mention other di ##s ##g ##run ##tle guest in the just in the lobby . . . A complete disaster ! I gave the M ##OD my business card I ' m awaiting a call from the management . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Too ##k forever to check - in . Twice , A ##FT ##ER dinner , we were told our room wasn ’ t ready . Then for the next two nights - they NE ##VE ##R cleaned our room . Both nights upon return from our meetings we were told o ##ops , sorry , it ’ s too late to get someone here , we ’ ll send clean towels . What ? Where was management ? How is this acceptable for a She ##rato ##n ? Would not recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Like many hotels , they have a designated pickup spot for U ##ber . It ' s not at the main lobby entrance , though , and we experienced two U ##ber drivers not being able to find us . I spent $ 10 in canceled - ride fees as a result . G ##rr ##rr ##r . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always stay here because we love the neighborhood and easy proximity for Michigan Avenue shopping . The bonus is the friendly staff , red ##one beautiful rooms , great bar and bar food . Hotel is small enough to comfortable and feel safe . We live it here and always call it our second home ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] B ##rough ##t my family of 5 hear to stay the night after going to the fireworks show . We loved our room ! Breakfast was good and the selection was good . The free beer and wine was also great in the evening . We would definitely return . 5 stars ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great small hotel that gives the type of personal service you would expect from a " bout ##ique " hotel ; easy check in , quiet room , excellent bar for a drink and most of all friendly service . I forgot the v ##alet staff out front always had a smile and remembered you from one day to the next . . . who does that anymore ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was convenient to major attractions . The staff was friendly . The lobby had many options available for eating . Would love to come stay again . The rooms and common areas were well kept . High ##ly recommend [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service at every area of the hotel . great u ##bic ##ation , every person on the hotel was friendly and helpful no doubt I will stay again with you . thank you very much for this wonderful stay with you ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Premier location for sights ##ee ##ing : The lake & Navy Pier , restaurants , major Parks , the River ##walk and Miracle Mile Shopping . The M ##TA is steps away From the hotel . You can take the Red Line to both baseball stadium ##s Direct ##ly from it . The hotel itself is lovely with a professional , Pleasant staff . Our room was large with a full size sofa , extremely adequate storage space , a large wall mounted TV which free ##s up the desk space for personal use . The room was in excellent condition overall . We would definitely recommend & return to the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Before they turn 10 emails to let you check in online with all possible questions about arrival time etc . . and then , when you arrive , the room is not ready and you have to wait . But this is not a service , it is a fool around customers who , among other things , pay a lot for having a room ! ! ! I did not expect this by So ##fit ##el ! It ' s shame ##ful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are a bit small , but it is a bout ##ique hotel . The de ##cor is really eye - catching - art de ##co - with soft colors . Room ##s are very clean and comfortable . Lo ##bby and meeting room areas have a very interesting seating areas where you can relax out of the bust ##le of the lobby and meeting activity . Happy hour everyday for hotel guests from 5 - 6 - prose ##cco and sang ##ria . Free and delicious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed in , laid down and immediately a bed bug was running across the sheets . G ##rab ##bed my stuff and left . The manager on duty refused to provide a re ##fu ##nd and said they needed a “ third party ” to even analyze if there was a bed bug . They eventually called security to have me removed from the hotel ! Because they were upset that I was asking them for a re ##fu ##nd and they provided no sympathy whatsoever . They also refused to put a note in the system that I was cancel ##ling because of bed bugs . Never again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here many times in the past . Always had a positive experience . However , this trip was certainly our best . Many changes made enhanced our experience . Except ##ional service throughout beginning with check in and at the Library [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly bout ##ique hotel situated in a central location . All staff ( from house ##keeping to bell ##man to the front desk staff ) are exceptionally helpful and friendly .

1	[CLS] This hotel is amazing ! From the location to the rooms ! We just stayed there for 4 nights to celebrate the 4th of July ! My 2 daughters loved it ! and oh boy ! They treated them like princess ##es ! Since we arrived they offered them a toy from a treasure so they had a big smile from the very beginning . We were able to use the FA ##IR ##MO ##NT GO ##LD L ##O ##UN ##GE and it was exceptional ! Food was amazing but the best part of it was Mr Pat ##ric ##io , our waiter ! Every single day he received us with a smile on his face , every time the kids wanted BA ##CO ##N he ran somewhere and got it for them ! The girls just loved Pat ##ric ##io and for me was very nice to see my girls happy ! Thank you Fair ##mont and Pat ##ric ##io for making our weekend such a great experience ! Total ##ly recommended ! FA ##IR ##MO ##NT is always a great option ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located near City Hall , the Blue and Orange Lines , this hotel is a great place for a business trip . It ' s an old place , so you ' ll find small rooms , but given the ease of staying here , you ' ll quickly forget that . There is a Star ##bu ##cks downstairs , a few good restaurants close ##by , and a W ##al ##green ##s too . Easy walk to sites downtown if you have a minute . The 4 - 6 ##pm Happy Hour in the lobby bar is wonderful - $ 5 wine / beer and super friendly bartender ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a beautiful stay at this hotel . The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff were helpful and kind . Had drinks in the Ta ##p ##room that was amazing and the con ##cier ##ge service was the best . High ##ly recommend this hotel if you are staying in downtown Chicago area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I paid weeks in advance a king room with an upgraded view and late check - in . Called the morning of to confirm that my room would not be given away checking in a 1 : 00 AM . A ##rri ##ved at the hotel at 1 : 15 AM and sure enough they gave the room away and put me and my wife in a double room with Full Si ##ze Matt ##ress . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything was just so special at The Talbot . The staff was very helpful and friendly especially David the door ##man . I feel i have made a few friends at The Talbot and can ##t wait to re ##vis ##it Chicago ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sisters and I brought my parents ( in their mid eight ##ies ) for a weekend in the city . We had a lovely room ( suite ) and access to the gold lounge . The hotel staff , and particularly the gold lounge staff , were so very kind and welcoming to all of us ! With the cold winter weather ( and limited mobility ) , we really appreciated the delicious food and friendly staff . I highly recommend this hotel and , in particular , the gold lounge . They made our visit so special and memorable ! Thank you all ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location in Chicago . Right on State Street ( a Great Street ) in the heart of the theatre district . Hotel o ##oz ##es " Chicago style " roaring 20 ' s style ( though built years before that ) but with all the modern convenience ##s a person could want . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had an awesome time at the kin ##zie Hotel ! The hospitality was amazing and we were able to really enjoy ourselves . The happy hour is a M ##US ##T ! Ask for j ##osh in the double cross . . He went the extra mile to make sure our stay was exceptional ! Will definitely book here the next time we ' re in ch ##ica ##go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were so excited to find good rates for this weekend in Chicago that we planned a last minute trip here with our teen daughters . We chose the She ##rato ##n Grand because of its location and were anti ##ci ##pating a great stay . What we got was much less . Date ##d rooms and dirty bed blankets and very slow customer service . Dirty shower ##s in the gym area that even after my husband pointed it out for three straight days never got touched . Great location right on the river though ! I ’ ve been in customer service my entire life - this place either needs to find better efficiency or bulk up their staff . I am giving three stars because they did try to re ##ct ##ify the dirty blanket issue AND we originally got a good deal when we booked - so I can ’ t expect gold trim ##ming ##s and red carpet ##s , I suppose . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An exquisite suite looking over the lake , but sitting back from it . The amazing Fair ##mont service . One arrive , they work to get us a room right away , welcoming . Everyone , from the front desk to con ##cier ##ge , to house ##keeping looks after you to make sure your stay is perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Public is just a cool place to hang out . I love the Library bar especially . And the location is excellent . The rooms are nice clean white and the beds are very comfortable . We particularly like the corner Lo ##ft rooms . The regular rooms are very small in comparison . It ' s worth spending a little more . Need ##s improvement : The bathroom ' s are okay but no fan and difficult to put make - up on in because of the lighting . Downs ##ide : the air ##con system - it ' s old and noisy so we tend to shut it off at night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chi ##c modern hotel with a classic elegant feel . The location is within walking distance to great restaurants . I enjoyed the walks while ad ##miring the view of the old brown ##stone architecture of the nearby homes . In the room , The bed , though low was quite comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great time staying at the Ambassador . The room had a great view of the city . The staff was also very kind and helpful . Jared at the front desk gave me great suggestions for things to do in the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have stayed at many Kim ##pton properties over the years as I love their pet " policy . " So , even when I travel " pet ##less " , I always chose Kim ##pton . Well , the Hotel All ##egro lives up to the Kim ##pton standards , but even more so ! From the moment of my arrival and through my departure everything was amazing . It is one of the largest Kim ##pton properties , but that size does not distract from the service . I had a lovely corner room that was more than enough space . Although the bathroom is rather " pet ##ite " it is still well organized and uses the space quite efficiently . I have no complaints about anything during my stay ! ! ! I will stay there again on any future travels to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed in the hotel for 5 nights during an exhibition in Chicago . The hotel is in a perfect location for a lot of the c ##it attractions , good restaurants and theaters , etc . Hotel is very clean and nicely decorated . Room ##s could be a little bit larger ( but it ' s still OK ) . My room was newly furniture ##d . Bath room has all the credentials that you want , shower is great , only minus is again the small size ! Another nice feature is the free coffee in the morning in the lobby and free Pro ##se ##cco between 5 - 6 ##pm in the same place . As ##par ##t of the " business package " we had free W ##i ##F ##i ; not sure if this is for everyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Monaco while in town to go to Riot ##F ##est . The location is f ##abulous - everything a quick walk or l ##y ##ft away . Our room was on the 14th floor overlooking the river and it was FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C . House ##keeping was incredible - the room was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble ! And thank goodness for those large bathroom ##s - with three girls staying four nights the good lord knows we needed all that counter space and room ! Eric ##k St ##rom ##beck is amazing - so ho ##sp ##ita ##ble and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and we L ##O ##VE ##D being greeted by Riley the GM ##s boxer : ) Al ##var ##ado was so ##o sweet too always making polite conversation while we were waiting for our rides . We will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in town for business and stayed a week . Hotel is in walking distance of everything you need . Rate ##s were reasonable for the area . Room was large , clean and quiet . I will definitely come back next time in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So stayed for a business trip and it ' s a lovely looking hotels . It ' s very Al Pac ##ino era looking and easy on the eye . Room wise it ' s a little more dated then other Kim ##pton but it ' s comfortable . The restaurant is a little walk from the reception and then you have to go downstairs again but the food is pleasant . Do take advantage of the free happy hour they have at the reception area at 5 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The check in experience was not great even though the problem was solved . The prices are very high ( and I compare this to London prices ) . The handling fee for a package I sent to the hotel was a right shake ##down too . It overs ##had ##ows what they get right - great b ##uff ##et breakfast ( at a price of US $ 31 I ' d be outrage ##d if it wasn ' t amazing ) , V ##ER ##Y comfortable bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay was ok , but charges were added to our card in error . Management agreed to reverse them and then didn ' t . Still trying to sort it out through the credit card company months later . Be careful . . . when their advertisement says free parking . . . They really don ' t mean it . They ' ll also agree to credit you and then won ' t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont is a great central ##ly located hotel . Great location . Great staff and service . The gold level was a great experience I definitely suggest the lakes ##hore athletic club . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a lovely hotel . The rooms were perfect kitchen ##ette was easy for making the odd sandwich and meals . ST ##af ##f were all very nice helpful with all my many questions . Door guys we great so helpful in showing us the way to many places , my husband had plenty of laughs with them what a perfect way to arrive at the hotel . Only slight negative was the breakfast room so over crowded and he ##ctic on the weekends . Very good food though different every day would we stay again Yes [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is one of my favorite places to stay in the city for short periods of time . The location is great , with plenty to walk to in the evenings after work . The rooms are spacious and very well cared for . The staff is respect ##ful and at ##ten ##tive ; and the whiskey selection at the bar is one of the best in the city . I come frequently and enjoy my stay every time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had an exceptional experience at the fair ##mont ! Staff very helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Wish they had a pool and j ##ac ##uz ##zi as well as a larger gym . Room ##s need new furniture and a paint job . One particular person was so helpful in helping me with accommodation ##s for my 87 year old [UNK] ( Gail , the con ##cier ##ge ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love Kim ##pton hotels typically , but this one is much different than most of the others I have stayed at . I get it ' s an older building , but the rooms feel old and more like a Mar ##riot ##t from the early 2000s than your typical Kim ##pton . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . Con ##ven ##ient location in the heart of Chicago . I especially enjoyed THE BA ##R in the hotel . Ser ##or took very good care of us . He mixes the most delicious cocktail ##s and has a very warm personality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel with an amazing supporting staff , the bedroom are very well design and mattress are comfortable . The only issues experienced was with one section of the hotel , the food service from the restaurant to in - room dining . They need to be re ##ex ##amine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a brief stay here on business . Check in was a breeze despite late arrival . Room was pleasant , feels like an old school R ##itz ( separate shower bath and a door that closes for toilet ) . Room was reasonably spacious as well . Location can ’ t be beat . Didn ’ t do much to test the customer service or house ##keeping since it was a one day stay , but would come again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was extremely beautiful ! The customer service was spot on and they even held our bags until very late at night . Although , the rooms were a little dirty . Our room was dusty and the towels had stain ##s on them . Overall it was a great stay though . Very quiet to sleep at . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a conference at the H ##ya ##tt recently . Location - wise , it was top notch . Lots of great restaurants and such in walking distance . The layout was a bit confusing due to the two towers on opposite sides of the street ( connected by both a bridge over and tunnel under the street ) . The hotel public areas were very nice . The room was also very comfortable , if on the small side . The sound ##proof ##ing was so - so . The crying / screaming child in the hall on multiple mornings was very loud . The house ##keeping staff was excellent . I swear they must have made my room up the moment I left each day . The layout for a conference was just me ##h . Lots of going between floors and waiting for elevators . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have been going to the Chicago O ##m ##ni Hotel for over 20 years . Previously I had stay at other hotels , but after staying at the Chicago O ##m ##ni it became my favorite hotel . It is central ##ly located , the rooms are huge , the restaurant is excellent and room service is very pro ##mpt and not expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A charming bout ##ique hotel in close proximity to the Ma ##gni ##fica ##ent Mile and the Gold Coast as well as the Art Institute and Mill ##eni ##um Park . It is all walk ##able . Con ##cier ##ges are knowledge ##able , very helpful and eager to make your experience in Chicago special . The restaurant , 20 ##E has a very good menu with great am ##bian ##ce and al f ##res ##co dining . A must try is the lo ##bs ##ter roll with a light home ##made a ##oli - delicious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice location and everyone very friendly . Don ' t buy the deal for club to snack / breakfast . That isn ' t worth it . Very crowded limited seating and more ethnic type food . B ##uff ##et awesome in their bi ##stro . Burger place there was good . Friendly and helpful staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] House ##keeping is on strike , no fresh towels , coffee , clean glass ##ware , etc . Pa ##id top dollar for city center experience and got Mo ##tel 6 treatment . No re ##course offered from manager on duty . Stay somewhere else ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the Talbot ##t Hotel was extremely friendly and helpful . The room was spacious and clean . The hotel is within walking distance of many restaurants and shopping sites , including the Water ##tower Mall . I would not hesitate to recommend the Talbot ##t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We originally booked the Hilton Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , which I ' m sure would have been wonderful , and probably more ups ##cale than the Home ##wood Suite ##s . However , when we found that we could book this hotel , which was more central ##ly located and included a free breakfast , we switched . Love ##d the convenience of being 1 block from a red line stop . We had booked a king suite since this was all that was available , but called ahead to request a two bed suite . Even though this was more expensive , when we got to the hotel , they moved us to the two bed suite without additional charge . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a couple of nights , never stayed in this part of Chicago . Kind of far north but still in the city limits . Walking distance is a bunch of restaurants and 2 blocks from the water . Small but decent gym . Nice lobby bar . The rooms were good size and comfortable beds ( however the bed was V ##ER ##Y low to the ground ) . Overall , nice experience . The internet though is very slow . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very nice hotel friendly staff nice room , but the bed was so hard I couldn ’ t get comfortable . I didn ’ t sleep at all , one thing I didn ’ t like is how the hotel staff only knocks on the door once then they come right [UNK] was naked trying to tell the staff to give me a minute but they kept coming in I finally decided to put the chain on the door [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for an extended weekend with a friend for my birthday . We both loved it . We order room service , and it was delicious . We also used the spa services , massage ##s in our room . They were lovely . The hotel is a great location . The room was clean . The beds were super com ##fy . The door men and desk attendant ##s are very friendly and helpful with everything we needed . Our only complaint ( If its even a complaint ) was when we ordered a wine opened , it was very cheap . It did not work well . I would definitely recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This stay was a f ##abulous experience . Love the hotel . Would stay there again in a heartbeat . i recommend this to everyone . Please keep up your great service . Can ' t wait to stay there again . A special thanks to Garrett . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great stay ! The location was convenient to everything ! We found a great place for breakfast nearby ( Yo ##lk ) . The corner king room had a great view . Staff was excellent - Michelle was great and so helpful . When we come back , we will stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I booked the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker I was not expecting a v ##alet parking fee of $ 69 per night ! I can forgive this as parking is expensive in general in downtown Chicago . A small problem we had was , the hotel restaurant was closed when we got back around 10 . 30 ##pm one night and the staff said they could not heat up our 1 - year - old ' s pre - cooked meal . The room was very com ##fy and the space was satisfactory considering the location of the hotel . The restaurant staff ( when it ' s actually open ) are extremely friendly and wonderful to talk to . A good hotel , but the extra expenses can add up and you ' d end up paying a hundred or so more dollars than you signed up for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family was treated great during our weekend stay . We used the pool and health club . Both were clean and in good condition . The rooms may be slightly dated , however , for the price , it was a great value and we ’ d definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed our stay tremendous ##ly . Had the shrimp and g ##rits in the restaurant and they were to die for . I travel a lot so to find a gym that ' s fully equipped was a plus . The rooms were spacious and clean . I would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always stay at the So ##fit ##el when visiting Chicago . It ’ s like a French o ##asis 2 blocks from Michigan Ave . The rooms are lovely , beds comfortable , and great bathroom ##s and amenities . They always provide a great robe and slip ##pers too ! The breakfast menu is great . Food and coffee delicious ! The bar is fantastic as well for great cocktail ##s and wine as well as y ##um ##my food for a light dinner or snack . The staff throughout the hotel are amazing and so welcoming . Can ’ t wait to return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed a Friday / Saturday night . Got a great price at $ 199 / night . See ##med a bargain for the area on Michigan A ##v . Would still rate same if price was higher . Vale ##t parking was steep at $ 68 per night . Room was clean , spacious and well appointed . The sleeping area was separated from the office / living area which is nice . Don ' t know if this is standard or not . View from 60 ##8 was not great but there was a limited view of the sky ##line . Only ate breakfast at hotel and it was excellent . I have had better eggs ben ##edic ##t however . Hotel is short half block from Michigan A ##v . The river was 7 - 8 blocks from the hotel . Millennium Park and the Art Museum are another 6 - 7 blocks South of river and an easy walk . Don ' t miss the bean sculpture . Hotel is in center of the major shopping district . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall , I enjoyed my stay at this property . The room was clean and in good condition . The elevators worked quickly and efficiently . The bed was very comfortable . The location is great . . within walking distance to a lot of places . I did have some issues with some of the staff on the day of check out , which I noted in my guest survey . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect place , close to all attractions . The hotels is beautifully decorated making charming our weekend there . Denise the con ##cier ##ge was very helpful and kind , the person who you should go to see before to book any activity in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely hotel in a lovely location . Like most older hotels the room shape was odd and it was dark . The beds were comfortable and the service was excellent . I ’ m just not sure it matched the price point of the property . We were there for a conference and after it ended we went to a similar level hotel in another chain less than a mile away and our rate was $ 80 less per night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Fair ##mont ( just like all Fair ##mont hotels we have stayed in ) , is excellent . The rooms are spacious , well decorated and clean . The staff are extremely friendly and helpful . Special mention to Mu ##gi , Abraham and Man ##dan ##a in the lounge on the 13th floor for going beyond what we could expect . We asked the con ##cier ##ge for a fridge in our room and a guy appeared at the door 10 minutes later with a fridge . We also requested a k ##ett ##le ( we are English and prefer tea to coffee ) and that was also delivered quickly - and no extra charge for either of these items . If you are going to Chicago , stay at the Fair ##mont . It ' s a bit price ##y , but well worth it . We stayed in 8 hotels on our trip to the USA in June / July and the 2 Fair ##mont ##s ( Seattle and Chicago ) were by far the best of them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoy my stays at this Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal . Whether it is Will at the door with a warm smile and a hard ##y hello or Malcolm from Guest Relations ##hips adding that little extra to make me and my family feel extremely welcome , back at the hotel . What also makes our stays just extraordinary , is the breakfast staff . My family and I need to give a huge shout out to U ##y ##gan , Wall ##ior , Em ##ers ##ov and Din ##ka and to the rest of the staff for making us feel right at home . And Chef , the baked beans are amazing . Thank you . We are looking forward to our next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Close to She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , The Bean , Soldier Stadium and Buckingham Fountain . A short U ##ber ride to everything else and the Hotel is magnificent . Friendly staff , clean rooms and Kitty O ' Shea ' s downstairs , it doesn ' t get any better than that ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable hotel in great location right on the river . Large and well appointed rooms . Very friendly staff . Many rooms have a beautiful view of the lake , the river , or the central business district . [SEP]
1	[CLS] OK I ' ll admit I usually stay down the street at the Drake , but all the hotels were full due to some big convention and I was put up at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker hotel . I was surprised that W ##i - Fi cost extra , maybe that ' s the same in all hotels in Chicago I ' m not sure . I had pretty much a concrete view , no lake ##front . My TV did not work and they had to come and replace it the next day . ( The operator at the desk told me I could come downstairs to the lobby to watch the news , but I said that ' s not gonna work when I ' m shower ##ing and putting my make up on ) . There is no room service whatsoever . Last ##ly , coffee really sucks here , and when I went downstairs to buy some it was $ 3 . 50 . Other than that the hotel was clean , and it looks it had been updated with in the last five or 10 years . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Do not accept ‘ first available ’ , unless you are okay with a hand ##ica ##p accessible room that requires that you hold the shower spray , or have it spray everywhere , or turn it off . It was a huge ordeal to get a different room , and we were without a room for 7 hours waiting . We do L ##O ##VE this hotel location and the water views . Everything else is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A beautiful hotel with wonderful staff within walking distance to all the sights and restaurants . Room ##s were spacious , bed was comfortable ( and clean ! ) , bathroom ##s well equipped and also clean . The staff ( especially the door ##men and bell ##hop ##s were very kind and helpful when looking for recommendations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Con ##cier ##ge was amazing made my daughters birthday extra special . Place ##d chocolate covered straw ##berries In room while we were being tourists . An amazing surprise . . . . . . Would definitely recommend this to friends and family [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is in a fantastic location . It has some traditional roots with a lot of appeal . I think the menu could be updated and the room integrated with more technology . . . but all in all its a great place to call home when you experience Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Only stayed here for 3 nights but very friendly and professional staff , clean comfortable room and great restaurant and bar made this a very enjoyable stay in a great city . Location is just out the centre but close enough to all sites and the lake to make this hotel ideal for all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice old Chicago hotel . The rooms are small , but if you ' re just staying for a short time or just you and one other person you don ' t really need a lot of space . The bathroom ##s in the room are great ! The only issue with this Hotel is their elevators . The elevators are extremely small they hold maybe 3 - 4 adults without luggage , and they take a very long time to get to your floor . We ended up taking the stairs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is very clean and modern . Staff is exceptional . I also really like having Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby . The only negative was not the hotel ' s fault . The constant fire and police sire ##ns were problematic to say the least . Welcome to Chicago , I guess . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Older building ( Chi ##c , art de ##co ) in great location , close to everything one block S ##W to wells / washing ##ton , one block NE to Clark / Lake . Everything was nice and clean , room was big and comfortable . Only down ##side was that I took a friend with me for this trip ( 5 ##day ##s ) and when they asked about the W ##if ##i they were told the hotel did not have any , that they should go down to the Star ##bu ##cks . . . . . Um , wrong and we are rewards members . I am not sure what was the deal with the desk staff this particular stay but they were off . Other wise it was the usual Kim ##pton stay . Great ! ! . As with the rest of the town , parking will cost you a fortune . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here and had a good experience right up to check ##out . I feel forced to leave this review just to get noticed . Been trying for days to get a re ##ceipt sent to my email but nothing . Contact ##ed via website . No response . Left messages . No reply . Called to get a live person who promised to help then transferred me to voice ##mail . Haven ' t heard back from that message either . I ' m confident if they had an issue with the charge I ' d be talking to someone in minutes , but I guess since they have my cash there is no motivation to help with my simple request for a re ##ceipt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in was rocky . Room wasn ' t ready . My wife and I went to the living ##room bar for drinks and met the rude ##st bartender ever . We were ignored for almost 15 minutes , before we were told that didn ' t have what we tried to order . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d everything . The suite is just a kitchen ##ette so no stove but everything was clean and staff was friendly . The rooms are a very nice size . Bed ##room was separated from the living room area . Only thing it needed was a separate entrance to the bathroom without going through the bedroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super clean staff was great . Wen ##t for the weekend . Order ##ed room service food was fantastic . We took the train into Chicago because parking is way over ##p ##rice ##d everywhere in the city . Room was beautiful and the location was perfect [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service excellence , wonderful experience would stay again and again . Room was quiet and comfortable I was offered an upgrade at min charge . It was a welcome surprise and the food was delicious . Location was excellent [SEP]
0	[CLS] We loved our stay at the Talbot ##t Hotel ! The location is perfect , the rooms comfortable and clean , and the staff was so friendly and helpful ! Perry made sure we had everything we needed and made us feel right at home ! Would definitely return and recommend to friends ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From Michael the Irish tenor door ##man to Suzanne at the Con ##cier ##ge desk and every housekeeper in between , what an awesome experience . They take care of their employees and they pass on the care and benefits to all their guests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just spent Saturday night at the Hotel Monaco . My wife and I were celebrating an anniversary and needed a little get ##away . Check in was friendly and pain ##less . We had one of the corner suites and it was perfect for us . Kim ##pton surprised us with a bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary - - very nice touch . My wife loved the windows seats . Bed was great - - got a great night sleep . Was going to just find a coffee shop for breakfast but ended up grabbing a fine breakfast at the South Water Kitchen in the Hotel . My wife said we should get the exact same room every year - - I said why wait a year ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the greeting at the front desk and throughout my stay . . this hotel was beautiful and comfortable . A f ##abulous location to stay while downtown Chicago . The room was very clean and the view of downtown and Lake Michigan from the corner room couldn ' t be surpassed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent service and a beautiful hotel , employees go out of their way to make your stay worth ##while . Even better , it ’ s directly in the mix of things in downtown Chicago . De ##fin ##ite ##ly worth the price and will be staying there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I never write reviews but felt that this experience and hotel deserved a shout out . Recently organized a weekend in Chicago for my boyfriend ##s birthday . I mentioned this on the phone when asking about an early check in and when we arrived , we found out they had put aside a wonderful room on their top floor for us and allowed us to check in early . Throughout our trip they made an effort to make the stay feel special , small birthday notes and treats from the hotel and house ##keeping staff . Everyone we encountered who worked at the hotel from front desk , to con ##cier ##ge , to door man and port ##ers to house ##keeping were a class act . A big thank you for making this weekend even more special for us - you went above and beyond . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came from Canada to this hotel because I heard some great things about it and by far it is all true . Nice warm friendly staff especially this one Individual who is a security Guard Named Kenneth Ba ##uti ##sta who stuck out the most he was very helpful and always out in front and at ##ten ##tive to everyone ' s needs made sure I stayed safe one night when walking me to the corner to show me where the night clubs were at . I will di ##ff ##iden ##tly be returning here with my friends again . love the fine dining as well with co ##zy fireplace . Amanda Harding [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really like this hotel . Not the best kept Kim ##pton hotel we stayed at , but a good option in Chicago and good rates . Dec ##or kits ##chy , as usual for the chain , but the rooms could have been in slightly better condition . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conference in Chicago - easy access to shopping and the pier ( each around 20 minutes walk ) . Room ##s very clean and plenty of restraint ##s nearby . Pier was largely closed but plenty to see and do in Chicago . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not a good hotel if you want adjoining rooms and a friendly atmosphere . I made reservations in May for adjoining rooms and re ##con ##firmed adjoining rooms two days before our trip . We were by the front desk that adjoining rooms were not available . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first trip as a couple left the kids at home and when we arrived we have a table of welcome fruit and cheese saying happy anniversary it was amazing the view from our room over the lake and park was so breath ##taking ! ! The staff was so welcoming very friendly and well informed about things to do in the city of Chicago a beautiful city to visit ! Will be back to Hilton Chicago and this city to ! ! Tell everyone about this hotel must stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The cost per night of the room was a bit price ##y and more than we wanted to pay . But we didn ' t have choice of dates as it was my daughter ' s Fall Break from college . Hotel does offer great location with professional , helpful staff ; spacious , clean rooms ; good food for breakfast , didn ' t have a chance to try the evening reception . Only negative was the poor w ##if ##i connectivity in suite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were married with a Cook county Judge , in his robes , overlooking the waterfront on a clear beautiful day . The hotel staff did a great job with the food and the wedding cake in our suite . Will definitely stay there again on our next trip back to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is an excellent piece of historic Chicago by its location and fascinating history . The many upgrades have kept the hotels beautiful de ##cor intact . Would highly recommend the tour with Jessica . She does and excellent job of detailing the history of the hotel while marketing the Hilton brand and it ’ s significance in Chicago history . Excellent job Jessica . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At first , Swiss ##ote ##l gives a great impression . Staff are helpful and polite . W ##i - fi sucks big time . I could not get a connection for anything . Staff members AL ##SO could not assist on this . The TV is ridiculous ##ly large and more complicated than it should be . Be careful how you use the phone or you ' ll get an in ##f ##lated bill . Is it nice ? Sure , but for what Swiss ##ote ##l charges , this is a highly imp ##ractical choice for a stay . It might e ##voke a chuckle from some , but I ' d settle for a Mo ##tel 6 over Swiss ##ote ##l . By the way , after 11 : 00 PM you cannot get a meal ( Huh ? ? In downtown Chicago ? ? ? ! ! ) . Last ##ly , the views ( obviously ) are quite impressive . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Spa ##cious room , recently re ##mo ##del ##ed and located in the heart of this great city there is no better value in Chicago . I have traveled across the globe and rarely have received the quality of hospitality as I received from the staff at the Ki ##nz ##ie . From this moment forward , when I return to Chicago for future visits , my preferred destination will be the Ken ##zie . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Location , the staff at the front ##des ##k is awesome , the Tu ##na Sal ##ad at the restaurant is the most ta ##sty and healthy , but the g ##em of the crown , was the partnership they have with the Fitness Center nearby Lakes ##hore Sport & Fitness Illinois Center , is the best deal ever ! ! ! I will back only because this add value , please keep the partnership and do marketing around this , this is mine gold for guest that travel on the fitness mode . Thank you for this ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I selected The Talbot ##t for its excellent location and because it was advertised as a bout ##ique hotel . True , it isn ’ t nearly as large as the nearby hotels but it really lacks the warmth and personal touch I ’ ve come to expect in this type of hotel . The front desk is hidden in the back . There was no greeting or warmth from any of the staff save for the housekeeper . In addition one of the two elevators was out during my entire 4 day stay , leading to extended waits and several walks down from the 15th floor . The room I had was clean , comfortable and quiet . Ben with that I think I ’ ll find somewhere else to stay next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a te ##rri ##fic place to stay . Con ##ven ##ient location but off the frenzy of Michigan Avenue . My room was clean and comfortable and had a te ##rri ##fic ch ##ais ##e on which to sit and work . The bathroom was large with a nice tile ##d shower and a large tub . Staff was helpful and a newspaper was provided in the morning . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a wonderful stay in a prestige suite @ the So ##fit ##el . Friendly reception ##ist , super clean & beautiful room , So comfortable bed , Her ##mes " orange ve ##rte " soap , . . . what a treat ! On top of this , the con ##cier ##ge contacted the marathon runners to check interest & organize car ##b ##load food as well as massage when needed + a friendly message from the management e ##ith a G ##ator ##ade and protein bar in the room + a compliment ##ary runners b ##uff ##et @ 5 ##am To finish , friendly door ##men , perfect house ##keeping and of course the unique " So ##fit ##el touch " My message to the entire So ##fit ##el team is a warm " thank you " Going back at the end of November for a week : looking forward to be there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located ten minutes walk from Chicago & State Red Line , this hotel was easy to locate from the nearest metro station . Class ##y looking hotel , good helpful reception and staff . Located just off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , this is well located , just under ten minutes walk from North Avenue Beach ( Lake Michigan ) and twenty five minutes walk to Mill ##eni ##um Park . Bath ##room was fine and bed so comfortable . Room very good with free in - room safe . Free W ##i - Fi freely available throughout the hotel . There are plenty of places to eat in the locality and there is a large 24 hour W ##al ##green ##s Con ##ven ##ience & Pharmacy nearby . Bloom ##ing ##dale ##s and Macy ' s are within a short work with many prestige retailers . Only down side was the fridge noise going on and off in the room . Would happily stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were great and spacious . I found the reception staff to have a bit of an bad attitude on occasion . Excellent location for anyone on a flying visit , with so many places to see , shop and eat at , all within a few minutes walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent customer service . Especially the front desk representatives . The Hotel is beautiful , the rooms are im ##ma ##culate and the views are magnificent . The So ##fit ##el is perfectly located close to everything . So many restaurants , shops and stores nearby . A ##wes ##ome ! [SEP]

Special shout ##out to Sergio my server at the banquet who made me feel like a Queen . My room initially smelled like cigarettes but i was immediately relocated to another fresh smelling room . A refrigerator to for my personal use would have been appreciated but otherwise the amenities were great and I slept very comfortably and had great view . Thanks for your hospitality [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hello , our stay at the Ambassador Chicago has been the highlight of our stay . Warm , inviting always welcomed in . Very polite professional at the front desk . I can not mention them all . The room was not what I thought I requested but that was through Ex ##ped ##ia and I clearly hold this as my fault that I did not call direct and make sure . I paid 153 ##1 . 51 for a double bed room , and thought it came with sitting room on the side . So it was a bit of mi ##s ##gu ##iding online ordering . We were with the An ##hol ##t / H ##ya ##tt wedding parents of the bride . So we were on a blocked booking and should have been put with that . Again , my error . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just what you expect from Intercontinental properties . Great service . Great rooms . Great location . I ' m in Chicago regularly and love to stay here anytime I can . It ' s really nice how many food choices are either in the same building or are close by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I highly recommend this Hilton property . The rooms are very nice and clean . The food in the restaurant was exceptional . Con ##cier ##ge Rob tended to all of our needs and request ! I look forward to coming back to Chicago and staying at this location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central location on Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , walking distance to several good restaurants - the Purple Pig is right across the road . Room ##s are well - maintained and clean . Show ##er pressure is good . G ##ym is well equipped , and the heated swimming pool is beautiful . Breakfast is excellent - the best egg station ever ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hospitality . Location is excellent with all the sight seeing and restaurants available nearby . Quick access to the city tours . Shopping readily available with the Million Dollar Mile only walking distance away [SEP]

1	[CLS] Very impressed with this hotel ! From the amazing fruit in ##fused water and Cubs dough ##nut ##s in the lobby to the breakfast on every floor , this hotel will not di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! We also got drink coins and access to a cocktail lounge that had delicious app ##eti ##zers and a very friendly bartender ! The Ki ##nz ##ie is within walking distance to everything you want to see in Chicago ; the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Navy Pier , The Chicago Theatre , the possibilities are endless ! The rooms at the Ki ##nz ##ie are very modern and updated ! They had a map of Chicago as the wall ##paper which is super cool , a mini - fridge and a Ke ##uri ##g ! The employees at the Ki ##nz ##ie were very welcoming and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and gave you any suggestions from what to do and where to din ##e ! We will def ##iant ##ly return ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] When my husband booked this hotel , I was skeptical as we were travelling with our two young children . However , the staff were amazing and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! ! ! They were at ##ten ##tive and incredibly helpful when I needed some extra hands or distract ##ing entertainment to keep them occupied . The hotel is right in the middle of the action on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and we were able to walk everywhere . We enjoyed the restaurant on the top floor and highly recommend the h ##ue ##vos ranch ##ero ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a long weekend for a business conference . Con ##ven ##ient and efficient . Room ##s were clean and well appointed . Was upgraded to a " room with view " which couldn ' t be beat ! Getting your car back from v ##alet parking is a bit of a hot mess during busy times ( plus exceptionally expensive ) . Will definitely take the train and L ##y ##ft / U ##ber next time . Good places to eat / drink in hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a good location across from Grant Park . We were on the 18th floor . The room is older but still in good shape . Our room overlooked the city - we could see the Willis Tower which was nice . There is v ##alet parking and self park but both are expensive . It is close to a subway location and many attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came into town with two dear friends for my big 50th birthday celebration recently . Ely and Kat ##lyn surprised me with a room upgrade , straw ##berries and champagne and compliment ##ary cocktail ##s in the lobby bar . I loved the details of this charming hotel , had an awesome breakfast in the hotel restaurant and slept like a baby . Most grateful to Ely and Kat ##lyn for the extra special attention to my special day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our 2nd time staying at the hotel and it was fantastic . The staff were so helpful and very welcoming . I love this property and we enjoyed the breakfast as well . I would stay here again for sure . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Wanted to to spend a few days in the city right before Christmas . This hotel was perfect location - right off Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , State Street . We walked to Daly Plaza , Mill ##enia Park , G ##ior ##dan ##os , Water Tower Place . Room was quite large - no mini frog or microwave though . Great shower , bathroom , beds . The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holiday and everyone we encountered on staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great experience at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago . We were there with a group for a wedding and stayed over a couple of days after . Facility , staff , service , restaurants , con ##cier ##ge were all excellent . Had exceptional service for dinner at The Palm restaurant . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A group of friends , 12 of us in all , enjoyed a weekend stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago ! We were extremely happy with everything from check - in , our rooms , the hospitality showed to us by So ##fit ##el staff , as well as our experiences at check - out . While we would have had a wonderful time staying elsewhere in the city , we know that our stay at the So ##fit ##el made our experience the best it could have been ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great location to tourist ##ic attractions and downtown with an amazing view . Of course you are paying the location but It really worth the price . Subway station is nearby if you like to enjoy and visit the city . The service is excellent and they make sure you are satisfied and comfortable . Room ##s are large and super clean . I have been here twice and I will again , no doubts . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Chris Schmidt , Cat ##ering Director at the Intercontinental in Chicago , was wonderful to work with . Communication throughout the wedding planning process was amazing and his attention to detail was phenomena ##l . There were some challenges and additions throughout the day and he was completely flexible and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our clients needs . Thank you Chris for all of your help and hospitality ! We are excited to work together again ! Michelle with NO ##RA Events ( wedding plan ##ner ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very pleased with the hotel . Second year I stay and the quality is the same . Prime location , very friendly staff , special breakfast . I recommend to anyone planning to travel to Chicago the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our extended weekend stay at the Conrad was perfect . As Hilton Gold members , they upgraded us to a suite immediately . The room was im ##ma ##culate and very high - tech ( you press a button to open the d ##rap ##es ; ask for house ##keeping , etc . ) The location is just off Michigan Avenue and within walking distance to restaurants , shops , the river , lake , etc . The rooftop bar has amazing views and excellent service . Every single person was professional and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very pleased with the clean ##liness and the location of this hotel ! Will definitely stay again ! Also , it is right around the corner from Eat ##aly , one of the best places to eat and grab an excellent cup of coffee ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the So ##fit ##el in Portugal and it was simply ma ##rve ##lous So i signed up for A ##cco ##r hotel rewards . So two weeks later for my birthday I try the one in Chicago . The beds were not comfortable the staff was not very friendly . The restaurant was closed for re ##mo ##del ##ing so that was unexpected the bar was over ##p ##rice ##d paid for a room with a view and all we saw was in the high rise apartments [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our last stop on a 2 week road trip and we wished we could have stayed a bit longer . The staff were super friendly and helpful . Our room was a decent size , very comfortable and great de ##cor . To top it off they have a social hour between 5 & 6 pm offering free Pro ##se ##cco , a great touch . The only thing that would have made it perfect was a coffee maker in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While the rooms are not the biggest or most up to date , they are clean , well appointed and fully functional for business . Hotel is amazing ##ly well located for in - town business and shopping , right on the Miracle Mile . No ma ##gni ##fying mirror in my room , otherwise it checked all my boxes . I was located right at the elevator bank and pleased that I did not hear the elevator sounds at all . I would recommend and stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a crazy policy of cancel ##ling your already booked and pre ##pa ##id room if you are not there by 12 : 00 ##am . I arrived just after 12 : 00 ##am to learn of this policy , by which time the hotel already sold my room to someone else . Apparently this is in the fine - print when booking but I failed to read this ridiculous policy . Meanwhile every hotel in the Chicago area was booked and I ended up out of town in a nearby city . The woman at the front desk only offered a ##pologies . No water . No help finding a room . Nothing . I will never return to this hotel or this chain again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is my first time to Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago . I go there for a business trip , and there is a conference in the hotel . I was very impressed with the smile and customer service . Also Mar ##lan ##os at the front desk was extremely helpful . I could see that he is really very kind and nice to every customer with smile and a great welcome . Help open the door , close the door , take the luggage ##s , help to answer the questions , help to store the luggage ##s . . . do anything he can help . This should be the top level service from the hotel . Here ’ s a few p ##ics for your reference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had an absolutely wonderful experience at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal . Eva at the front desk was super a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ( we had a booking hi ##cc ##up ) . The pool was massive , the rooms clean and spacious . I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was beautiful , I loved the fact that you had app ##eti ##zers , we met a lot of people there . I loved the location , everything was in walking distance which was a plus . I like the fact that the hotel is in walking distance from the train station , because I ' m not crazy about driving in Chicago . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad lives up to the Hilton Brand . The room was spacious . Bath ##room had very nice amenities . In room es ##press ##o maker was a true treat . The employees made the trip extra enjoyable . You can tell that customer service is a top priority . So enjoyed staying and look forward to staying again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed our stay at Palmer House for the C ##2 ##E ##2 . Beautiful hotel , outstanding service , comfortable room and good breakfast at Lock ##wood and b ##urger ##s at Potter ##s . The bathroom ##s could use a little re ##f ##reshing but they were adequate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is absolutely our favorite Kim ##pton hotel and we love staying here in Chicago . Great location - right in the loop , so there ' s public transportation nearby , as well as fantastic restaurants and a lovely view of the Chicago River . The best rooms in this hotel are the ones with a Giant Window ##box - it must be the size of a double bed . Two people can easily fit and watch the river , the pass ##ers ##by and sometimes it can be hard to tear yourself away to go out and experience Chicago ! The staff is kind and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and I love the de ##cor of the public spaces and the rooms themselves . Would highly recommend this hotel and I wouldn ' t stay any ##place else in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful and the staff is extremely friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . It is in a great location - near all of Chicago ' s most popular landmarks but in a quiet spot at the same time . Breakfast at the hotel restaurant , Cafe De Architect ##es , was delicious . The con ##cier ##ge is available to help with your every need . This was my second time staying here and it did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a long weekend with 2 friends . The hotel is perfectly located for easy walking to attractions , shopping and restaurants . Our room had 2 queen beds , plenty of space and great window seats . The hotel staff were friendly and gave us great restaurant recommendations . The compliment ##ary wine and can ##ap ##es were a bonus and a great chance to relax and re ##cha ##rge . A thoroughly stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Fair ##mont Millennium Park for a meeting In March 2018 . The location is perfect - right near the park ( obviously ) , the Art Institute , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and with views of the lake . As with all the Fair ##mont ##s we have had the pleasure of staying , the service was top notch from the Bell Hop ##s , front desk staff , bartender ##s , house ##keeping , etc . We upgraded to a club level room and having the use of the lounge was in ##val ##ua ##ble ! Food , drinks , service , view , etc in the lounge was phenomena ##l ! We would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I came to the Ki ##nz ##ie on a girls trip . We were here for 5 days . It ' s a beautiful hotel . The staff are inviting and made us feel very welcome . The room was fantastic ; clean , spacious and had very comfortable beds . What made this stay exceptional was Carl . He went above and beyond . He gave us so many great suggestions for places to go and things to do . He checked in with us every time we returned to ensure we had everything we needed . He truly made us feel valued and appreciated as customers and was really interested in how our daily ex ##cursions went . I will be returning to Chicago and will definitely stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 4 nights on business . Room comfortable but room safe was very small and couldn ' t take a laptop ; also was key ##ed rather than a combination safe . Good river view and lake just visible . Lac ##k of eating opportunities after 9 ##pm - " bar snack ##s " were not the ha ##mb ##urger / na ##cho ##s type offering i would expect and b ##urger restaurant closed at 9 . Fortunately a Whole ##F ##ood ##s nearby . Con ##cier ##ge were good and able to recommend a nearby diner for breakfast on Sunday . Con ##ven ##ient location for the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and shopping as well as for Navy Pier and parks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We pick ##et this hotel because it was close to the train stop from O ' Hare , actually it was closer than I thought ( less than a block from the Clark / Lake stop ) , The hotel is very nice with a lot of history and great d ##é ##cor . The staff is very friendly and helpful , the bar area is comfortable and inviting , and there are plenty of lobby areas to site and relax . Given that this is an old hotel the rooms are small , so it is not ideal for a family unless you have older kids that can stay in their own room . Easy walk to just about anywhere in downtown Chicago - River walk , the Bean , Millennium Park , trolley stop to Navy Pier , Willis Tower , Theater ##s , etc . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The rooms are amazing , everything is perfect , going to this hotel makes you feel like a celebrity , the only thing holding it from a 5 star is the un ##usa ##ble w ##if ##i , otherwise this hotel is perfect for vacation ##s and business trips . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency Hotel is my go to place to stay for relaxation , dining and holiday fun . The view of the Chicago river is exceptional . The lobby is well appointed and inviting . The rooms are spacious and clean . Only issue is no Net ##fi ##x on the television . As long as the H ##ya ##tt Regency keeps its high standards I will continue to be a satisfied guess . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My 3rd stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . Its old but in a great part of Chicago , The rooms are nice and have been re - modeled . No complaint there . The elevators are small and when its mid - day or around dinner time it can take 10 min ##s or longer to get one . The bar is decent but closes too early and doesn ' t open until 11 : 30 and you ' re lucky if your drink is served by 11 : 45 - lot ' s of attitude from the bartender that opens . On this trip , at night , a string trio was there playing music . . . . they refused to take requests and were rude . They charge for in room w ##i fi and $ 40 a day to park your car - that ' s a big negative . All in all good but sure could be better . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a very nice look and feel . The bed was extremely comfortable and the other furniture was solid , although the water pressure in the shower was almost painfully high and not adjust ##able . The view from higher up is quite nice . The location is relatively close to Navy Pier , which was convenient . Everything is a bit expensive but it is possible to find a good deal . There are also a few good options for breakfast nearby ( Wild ##berry Pan ##cakes & Cafe and Egg ##y ' s Din ##er , to name a few ) . The best thing about our experience was the great conversation with the front desk person ( Ke ##ena ##r , I think ) ? He was super cheerful and helpful and made us feel comfortable immediately in a fancy - feeling place . Our interaction started off our visit on the right foot . Give this guy a cookie ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A recent business trip to Chicago resulted in a stay at the O ##m ##ni Hotel . Excellent location off Michigan Avenue - walking distance to several shops and restaurants . Good size room , great natural light and modern setting . No issues with internet which is essential for a successful business trip . The staff was helpful and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pen ##d a few days here with a convention . On the river , great location for walking around downtown . Lo ##bby and public spaces were comfortable and seemed to be in good condition . My sleeping room was one that hadn ' t been red ##one in some time . Although it had the usual amenities , it was a bit worn , with mold ##ings and furniture showing wear and a chip ##ped shower soap dish in the bathroom . The rate was comparatively a bit high . I ##d ' stay here again but without enthusiasm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Having stayed at other Kim ##pton Hotels and been impressed , the Monaco is keeping up the standards . It ' s in an ideal position overlooking the river and within walking distance of shopping and tourist sites . As always with Kim ##pton , the staff are helpful , efficient and friendly without being in ##tr ##usive . The room ( corner suite , 7th floor overlooking the river and Trump Tower ) was extremely comfortable and well appointed . Super ##b views with amazing window seats . The Monaco ' s wine hour in the lobby for guests is a great Kim ##pton touch . Certainly a hotel to be well recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great experience , from the From the v ##alet staff ( Sal ) to the front desk and guest services ( Vol ##kan ) , room service and house keeping , we are very pleased to say that if you are coming to Chicago , you need to stay here : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay at the hotel was wonderful ! I was visiting for a conference , and couldn ' t have selected a better location . The continental breakfast included g ##lut ##en free options , and well worth the expense . Staff were very friendly and professional . [SEP]
1	[CLS] we had a great time at So ##fit ##el Chicago : - Hotel is located near Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile ( walk ##in distance 3 minutes ) - very friendly and helpful staff - renovated and modern Lo ##bby , bar , facilities etc . ( especially very good equipped gym ) - our room was quite big with a big bath area - room was clean and co ##sy - we slept very good - Hotel has a nice outside area , w ##hr ##e you can sit and have Dr ##ink ##s and f ##oof All in all : a great hotel [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel is a beautiful place to stay in the downtown area . However the people working at the hotel made my stay memorable and more enjoyable . The outside dining is a very nice touch . The location of the hotel is close to everything but just se ##cluded enough that it seems like a retreat right in the downtown area . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I took a trip to Chicago for a concert . We stayed at the So ##fit ##el on miracle mile . The hotel is beautiful and our stay was awesome . The rooms have all the amenities you would expect and then some . There was even two robes and two sets of slip ##pers in the room . You don ’ t see touches like that at too many hotels anymore . We had breakfast at the restaurant and it was delicious . They serve French press coffee right at your table , another nice touch . If you are heading to Chicago I recommend So ##fit ##el Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed a great stay at So ##fit ##el . Custom ##er service is excellent ; the staff is helpful and know ##led ##gable . The hotel is near North Michigan Ave , so is a perfect location for shopping or enjoying excellent restaurants . The Te ##mpo Cafe , a few doors to the West , is an excellent place to grab a quick breakfast , lunch or dinner . [SEP]
0	[CLS] High ##light of our Chicago trip was this hotel . Grande ##ur architecture and amenities . The most kind and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff to meet any means of your stay . Bravo on the f ##abulous food ! Leaving , we felt p ##amp ##ered and wells ##ati ##s ##fied . This included our Chi ##hua ##hua ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent Christmas and New Years at the Palmer House . The hotel seems to be running on its history . Over priced restaurant and bars . Security issues with elevators . Anyone walking in off the street could get in an elevator and go where ever they want . Front desk said they knew and were working on it - no Em ##p ##loy ##ees were great . After you get to know some of them they tell you how cheap and unfair Hilton is to employees . Did I mention they allow dogs ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for work and the location was definitely good , with a C ##VS across the street for any waters / snack ##s you might need . Walking distance to restaurants etc . I was with a group of co - workers who had nice rooms but my room , 232 ##2 , was FA ##R better than theirs because of the view . It is a large size room on the corner of the floor , which faced out towards the water and as such you got incredible sunset views . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend asking for one of these rooms , if you can ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In summary : - Great Room ##s - Friendly & efficient service - nice bar - great gym ! ! ! - love the So ##fit ##el Bed ##s ! - Location is Great Not many things to wish for . . . apart from expensive breakfast . . . why I prefer to go and grab it outside ; - ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Fair ##mont for a very last minute trip and stayed on the 15th floor with access to the gold lounge . High ##ly recommend . Worth the extra $ 50 a day for all of the food / snack ##s / drinks you have access to throughout the day . Man ##dan ##a and Abraham provided top notch service ! Both were very friendly and helpful . En ##joy ##ed our stay and wish it would ’ ve been longer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This very nice hotel sees many group events and is always busy . The rates are reasonable for such quality . The location is not ideal but is a two - block walk west to Michigan Avenue . The mattress and pillows were heavenly . The w ##i - fi was free to Star ##wood members . There is a pool but no hot tub . I had trouble lo ##cating a read ##able list of TV stations , and could not find an event directory on TV . As usual , the in - room coffee machine lacked enough cream ##er . But the room was clean and quiet . A nice hotel for an event or for Michigan Avenue shopping ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Overall the hotel was a great place for me to stay while in Chicago for meetings at Loyola University - Water Tower Place . The room was comfortable and s ##ty ##lish with comfortable bed ##ding and quiet setting . I appreciated the two free bottles of water provided each day , especially because the wet bar was very expensive . I did order room service for a late dinner one of the nights . The food was excellent with large portion sizes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Force ##d to stay due to conference . Continental breakfast for $ 29 . 00 with ’ meat ’ or $ 17 . 00 with no meat . Pay ##ing hotel guests have to PA ##Y for amenities like using the fitness center at $ 15 . 00 a day or $ 25 . 00 for unlimited . . . . . who in their right mind would stay here ? Depending on your rate , you are ST ##IL ##L PA ##Y ##ING for your room and they want to charge you for everything else that NO ##R ##MA ##LL ##Y comes with every other hotel in CO ##NU ##S ! ! I will never ever stay here again ! ! Po ##m is A $ . . . . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came to town to run the Chicago marathon and needed a hotel close to the starting line at Grant Park and a kitchen to prepare my pre ##race meal and store my 15 month old daughter ' s milk / snack ##s . This hotel fit all mine and my family ' s needs perfectly . The separate bedroom / living room set - up ensured that I would not bother my husband and baby with my early morning wake - up call on race day . Good quality toilet ##ries too ( N ##eu ##tro ##gen ##a ) . However , my husband said the compliment ##ary breakfast was just ok . Additionally , on top of all the restaurants in the area , there was a Trade ##r Joe ' s and Whole Foods within a few blocks walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed my visit . Bed ##s were very comfortable , as were the pillows . Room ##s were really clean and quiet . Re ##f ##rig ##era ##tors are not compliment ##ary . El ##eva ##tors took a long time , as they need more to accommodate the number of guests . However , desk staff were wonderful and allowed an early check - in and late check out free of charge . Would certainly visit again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice convenient downtown location combined with all service amenities a travel ##er may want . Conference rooms were splendid including sound systems , seating , and food services . Food was excellent , and rooms were clean . Nice fitness room on the 8th floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was well designed . third bed request was done during our absence . this made for pleasant return from theatre . bell staff was at ##ten ##tive and engaged . front desk was well co - or ##dina ##ted and professional . location is a great plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is top notch . The lobby is awesome and worth staying here at least once . They did a great job supporting our business function and the meals were awesome . The rooms were old and felt out ##dated but were very clean and well maintained . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The location , facility , staff and little extra ##s make this hotel a g ##em . High ##ly recommend it . The loyalty even on the second visit is te ##rri ##fic . This property made us feel appreciated and would make it our first choice when visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was lovely and the staff were very friendly but the cost of services was terrible . A bottle of Per ##rier from the refrigerator was $ 5 and breakfast for two $ 110 and not worth that much ! ! The coffee for the machine in the room was only replaced twice by the cleaner ##s ( we were there 4 days ) and when having dinner down at our meetings a glass of mineral water from the bar was $ 9 ! ! The refrigerator in the room was one of those that you can ' t put anything in , it was ch ##ock full of snack ##s which were very expensive but no room left for personal items like medicines etc . The room was kept really clean and the bed made perfectly and it was very comfortable . The television ##s were huge and reception good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location and price was good , plus the service , but it is / was a busy hotel our weekend . Be sure you understand the resort fee is on top of what you think you will be paying . I thought my website price included the 17 $ , but it did not . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a wonderful experience at the Hotel Monaco ! ! I worked with Cody Um ##bach to reserve a block of rooms for my co - workers and I for a 3 day business trip . Cody was extremely helpful and a pleasure to work with ! The staff at Hotel Monaco was very polite and did whatever they could to make your stay more enjoyable . The rooms are very spacious , nice , and clean . The only downfall was the views - Some rooms had gorgeous city views while others faced building walls . . . Other than that , I highly recommend staying at the Hotel Monaco ! I will definitely be staying here again the next time I visit Chicago for business or pleasure . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Chicago this past weekend . As soon as we entered the main doors , we felt like we were stepping into history , but with modern amenities . The rooms are good , service is excellent , the pool is awesome , everything was very good . And the location - can ' t beat it ! The reason I didn ' t give this a 5 star rating because I was a ta ##d bit annoyed at the staff for trying to push the Hilton Honors vacation club services on us . Not only did they try hard to sell it to us during check - in , but every day as we would pass by the lobby area , there would be staff who would approach us and ask us if we wanted to buy the offer . It felt like heck ##ling . I wish they wouldn ' t do that . Other than this one minor annoyance , we really enjoyed our stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thank you for the club room . S ##hout - out to Melissa at check - in , I ##rma from in - room dining , Maria at check - out , Connie and Ni ##da at club lounge who were so friendly and helpful in making our stay most enjoyable . Room , bathroom , club lounge , pool area , public areas were spot ##less . Bed felt like I was sleeping on the clouds especially looking out the window from 33rd floor , large screen TV is awesome , W ##i ##F ##i was re ##lia ##bly fast , in - room dining dishes were del ##ec ##table , club lounge had great offerings . Services were so sea ##m ##less they helped make for an effort ##less stay . Will only come back to this property when in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for two nights with family ( 3 generations of people ) and were truly impressed by the hotel , especially the customer service . The location is excellent , the rooms were modern and comfortable , and the staff truly made the experience special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good v ##ibes from the moment we walked into this hotel , from the staff at the front door to the front desk . Mir ##sad ##a and Jane - w ##ow , what a team , and a great way to begin our stay . Had some concerns about our reservation after we decided to stay an extra , un ##p ##lan ##ned night , during a sold - out convention weekend . However , any issues we had were eliminated immediately and with a display of great senses of humor . Not often have we found front desk hotel staff with such great personalities , who were also extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . First time staying here . Won ' t be the last . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed at many places near Chicago ' s Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . We will only stay at the Monaco on our future visits . Over the weekend we stayed at the Monaco for our 4th time and see no reason to look further for our future visits . Very friendly staff , great location , and beautiful / clean rooms . Some reviews have been critical of the furnishings . We don ' t see anything to critic ##ize . The Monaco doesn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our group of ten stayed here for three days . The rooms were very spacious . The people at the front desk very extremely helpful . They have a free wine hour everyday that made our stay that much better . Everyone had a great time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing hotel . Will definitely stay here again . B ##ES ##T P ##IL ##L ##OW ##S E ##VE ##R ! The views were amazing . Everyone was helpful and kind . The only negative was there was not a mini fridge in the hotel , so a lot of left ##overs went to waste . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very impressed with the clean ##liness of the hotel , gym and in particular , my room . The staff was extremely helpful and court ##eous as well . The conference facilities were laid out very well and the staff was available to provide any assistance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location ! ! ! Location ! ! ! ! Location ! ! ! Orange line stop to and from the airport on the west side Red line stop to W ##rig ##ley Field on the east side . Mill ##ine ##um Park two blocks away . Chicago River ##walk - 10 to 15 minute walk . Historic building . Room ##s are small and dated , but well kept and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , location , location . Close to all of the shopping and sights you must see in Chicago . Clean comfortable charming place to stay with character . My family and I were in town for a Wedding and we enjoyed our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service with the Gold package was a delight . We enjoyed the kindness of the staff with Mu ##gi , Jesus , and Sharon all being at ##ten ##tive to service . Every day a member of staff verified that our needs were taken care of and took time to see if they could assist with anything to make our stay comfortable . Our room was visited twice a day by house ##keeping for service . All areas of the room were clean and fresh towels daily . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great sidewalk seating for couples or groups of up to 6 . We enjoyed the food and found the location quiet and the service outstanding . Limited menu but everything you need for a nice br ##unch . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Old hotel , but nicely kept up , with newer , large fitness center . The Palmer house has a gorgeous fitness center , just as good as my fitness club at home ( which has never happened before at any hotel ) . Lots of charm to this place . Very good staff too . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I very much enjoyed my stay and wish I could ' ve spent more time here ! The early morning door ##man was very pleasant . He gave me a ton of detail on a great running path down by the river and how I can see the Bean before making my way back . He even remembered me when he saw me over the next couple of days . The rooms were very clean and nice , and I was sure to make myself feel at home . Everything was walk ##able from here , and I ' m looking forward to the next time i stay here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The historic charm of this hotel makes it worth the stay . Lin ##ing the halls of the hotel floors are black and white portraits of the celebrities that once performed in the Empire Room in the hotel . It was such a pleasant experience to return to our room each day and see Judy Garland , Sonny and Ch ##er , Sid Caesar and so many others . Everything from the ceiling in the lobby , the lighting , door knob ##s and mail ch ##ute on each floor made us wonder what it would have been like 75 years ago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is amazing . We had a corner room , with a look out to the river and could see the lake as well . I loved the focus on green , and we opted to fore ##go house ##keeping and keep the $ 10 / day credit . We had a separate shower and bath ##tub . There was a light in the closet , along with an emergency flashlight . The staff was incredibly helpful in providing directions . I would definitely recommend staying there if location and amenities are important . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We picked this hotel because it is a great location and had great reviews . We found an extremely reasonable rate for the weekend and grabbed it . The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble and the property itself is beautiful . Walking distance to many attractions . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Room was very clean and comfortable and every team member I dealt with was very friendly and at ##ten ##tive . I would highly recommend this hotel for the service alone but they also have a very nice restaurant and other amenities to offer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Loving Kim ##pton hotels and this one did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint our room was quiet and had decent amount of space . Everything works as expected . The staff were just te ##rri ##fic . All the services were on point . We love the wine hour which takes place daily in a beautiful space close to the lobby . The location is perfect . It ' s close enough to walk to many of Chicago ' s attractions and restaurants . Some other places like boys ' town is just a short u ##ber ride away . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] stops right in front of the hotel ( 2 property down ) . We feel safe walking around the hotel . Breakfast is only me ##dio ##cre with same stuff every day . Free light dinner 5 - 7 pm Mon - T ##hur . ( salad / soup , flat bread pizza were the two night we ate ) is only okay and they ' re out quickly , so go early if you plan to eat at the hotel . We end up going to nearby restaurants for dinner since the food were not that great . the cleaning lady at 16 ##F was awesome ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in a Club Room . It was high up with views over the river and city with wonderful lights at night . The hotel is central ##ly situated with easy walking access to Navy Pier , the shopping precinct and river boat landing . The staff in the Club Room looked after us well and we thank them . Although it was busy , they always had time to talk to us . We would also lie to thank Maris ##a , one of the Con ##cier ##ge team who helped us with our plans . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This historic hotel is in a wonderful location and when renovations are complete it will be amazing but high price isn ##t justified at the moment with service staff who don ##t care - no greeting ##s when leaving or arriving back at the hotel , no help with luggage down stairs etc . Room ##s are nicely renovated but bathroom ##s are small and in need of up ##grading . Air - con seemed to run but just couldn ' t cool our room down to the set temperature , even during the cooler nights . No coffee / tea making facility in the room is unacceptable . Best thing , apart from location , was the happy hour in the library - good selection of drinks and snack ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff from the day we arrived were professional and very welcoming . We got there super early yet they allowed us to check in 6 hours early at no charge . The rooms were clean and very spacious . The location put us in a very prime part of Chicago which we loved and enjoyed . Will definitely go back to the Talbot ##t [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie for a couple of nights on the 4th of July and were very impressed with how nice the rooms were with big picture windows , great de ##cor and furnishings ( sound proof ##ing was the only reason it wasn ' t a 5 stars ) . The service was good and our room rate included breakfast and compliment ##ary drinks in the afternoon for the adults . The v ##alet parking was very expensive but a necessity and the hotel ' s location was in walking distance of the centre of town . Overall really good value in an amazing city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##W ##EF ##U ##L . You . An hear everything through the walls . Phone ##s ringing doors closing . Phone conversations . The room is tiny . If there are two people in a room it is way to cramped . I would not stay here again if you paid me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would definitely book this hotel again . I love the social from 5 - 7 ##pm and the compliment ##ary breakfast . I had a room with a city view and I loved it . My bed was very comfortable and I love that the kitchen in my room had all the u ##tens ##ils I needed if I wanted to cook . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was in a fantastic location to start . Walking distance of everything and anything you need . The staff went above and beyond to make my group ’ s experience one to remember . Anything I needed the staff was more than happy to make it happen or help in every way they could . With a group of over 100 people I was expecting a few kin ##ks especially during check in , however the staff was incredibly professional and pro ##ficient with everything they did . I could not recommend The Talbot ##t more ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here in May 2016 for an overnight . Pick ##ed it because of it ' s proximity to the Cadillac Palace Theater ( next door ) . It was a very nice hotel , and was most reasonably priced of the " downtown " hotels . The staff was friendly , hotel rooms were a bit small but clean and room ##y enough for an overnight . The art de ##co period de ##cor was pretty cool too . Really nice place to stay downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a room through my company . Not only was the room beautiful and warming , but the view was absolutely perfect . Great over ##look of the heart of the city . Could not have asked for a better stay . We will be booking a room in this hotel every time we visit the city . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I chose this hotel because of it ' s close proximity to the broad ##way theater and its price . My daughter and I were so impressed with the room , especially the extremely comfortable beds . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend ##ing this to everyone I know and will definitely be back . Excellent so glad I chose the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Food was horrible , room was weird ##ly designed . The noise from the street was horrible . You can do much better for the same amount of money in many other hotels in Chicago . I would never stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are booked for 5 nights and this hotel meets and exceeds expectations . Of course it has all the Hilton amenities you expect . The rich history of Chicago and all the famous people who performed at the Empire Club are remembered in photos in guest room corridors . The architecture has been preserved and modern ##ized guest rooms fit the original motif [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an excellent hotel in a perfect location for a stay in Chicago . Service is at ##ten ##tive , staff is friendly , rooms are functional , w ##if ##i worked without problems . Not the most luxurious among the O ##m ##ni hotels , but perfect for our needs . It is our reference base when we come to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for two nights while we saw Hamilton , which is a block away . The hotel is historic and beautiful . Service was great . The room was small ##ish but comfortable . I felt we got a good deal for the location , which is within walking district of restaurants , museums , theaters and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I decided to spend the night at the Kim ##pton . I took the train downtown from the b ##ur ##bs . It was a short few blocks from Union Station . The hotel has an incredible de ##cor - lots of gray ##s and pink ##s . Hotel elevator zoo ##med us up to the 19th floor after our free prose ##co upon arriving ( between 5 & 6 ##pm ) . The bed was very comfortable . I remembered reading an earlier review about the water pressure being awesome and that reviewer was S ##O R ##IG ##HT ! Nice long hot shower . Not a hotel for kids , but for couples , it was a nice escape from the Chicago cold . If you are going to the theaters nearby , this would be the perfect spot for you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently spent 4 nights and had a very enjoyable Gold Experience stay . The service was excellent ( amazing staff in the Gold Lounge ) and the rooms were well equipped , clean , beautifully maintained and with great views . . . . at least ours did ! We found the location to be perfect for all we wanted to see and do in Chicago . We hadn ' t thought we would find Chicago so " walk ##able " but quite the contrary , we walked everywhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is NO ##T ACC ##EP ##TA ##BL ##E to charge fees with NO D ##IS ##CL ##OS ##UR ##E . I got a $ 17 charge plus taxes for an " U ##RB ##AN AM ##EN ##IT ##IE ##S F ##EE " total of almost $ 20 for one night stay . It should be included in the total price and not slid in on the back end when it ' s too late . When I questioned the person behind the desk and told her I was not made aware , the answer was lame . " it ' s automatic and just included as a standard " [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for a business conference and everything was very clean and organized . All of the staff is friendly and helpful . I can ' t comment on the value since my stay was paid for by work but the room I had was really fantastic and i was comfortable the entire week . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are clean , nice and spacious . We love everything about this hotel . The staff is awesome and the location is prime . We always try to stay here whenever we can . Its for sure a 4 . 5 start hotel in our book . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Ku ##dos to Ra ##quel at the front desk that accommodate ##d me earlier as I was exhausted from the flight . From the moment I stepped in I was treated with the u ##t ##most respect . From the v ##alet attendant ##s at the door to the maid ##s , everyone was so nice . I expected the room to be more modern due to the location and price , but it wasn ’ t bad . There ’ s a phone inside the bathroom which I found it a little bit odd . There ’ s no breakfast b ##uff ##et and what they had in the menu was very expensive . For the same amount they could work in a b ##uff ##et with better options . Pool and gym being repaired during the stay , but who goes to Chicago to go to the gym in a hotel ? Overall good experience , but I don ’ t think I would return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was a bit " tired " ( lump ##y paint on the bathroom door / an old - looking tub / a thick layer of dust on the climate - system vent ) , but I will still stay here again because ( 1 ) the location is great and ( 2 ) the pool was wonderful - - - - I like to swim for exercise and I could actually S ##WI ##M LA ##PS F ##OR AN H ##O ##UR without being crowded out by little kids ! ! ! ! ( They had lane divide ##rs and a sign saying " lap swimming only . " ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the accommodation ##s and run , and couldn ' t beat it for the price . The staff late night was even nice ##r , after hook ##ing us up with some free bottle ##d water after we were wandering the place late night looking for something more than what was in the pop machines . Very app ##re ##cia ##tive for being taken care of . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stay all around Chicago often , this is the best hotel we have experienced by far in Chicago ! ! We will be back . Until this trip Em ##bas ##sey Suite ##s has been my hotel of choice however Conrad raised the bar ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for New Year ’ s Eve and the hotel was fantastic . The history at this place is impressive to say the least . Close to everything and the staff was great . Mr . Wayne took care of us and even got us a couple closing pictures . We ’ ll be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the Mill ##eni ##um K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker twice now . Both times , we have found that the hotel is well - located near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and the lake and therefore within close walking distance to anything that you would need . The lobby area isn ’ t quite four - star and the hotel has seen a lot of wear and tear and could possibly use a fresh ##ening - up , but the rooms are clean , plus ##h and s ##ty ##lish and the price is remarkable for what you get . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ex ##p ##lo ##itive corporate capitalism at it ’ s finest . Sure the rooms are extra nice , hotel is in a prime location and you ’ re paying top dollar for that , $ 250 + \ night , but the Hilton will exploit you financially in almost every other way possible . Need bottle ##d water ? The cafe near the lobby has it for $ 4 ! Need a snack ? Small bag of chips , cereal bars , and other quick bites are $ 4 . Need a meal ? Ex ##pect to pay $ 15 - 20 / person . Prof ##its over people should be their motto . I was here for a conference and my stay at the Hilton cost 2 - 3 ##x as much as I spent on conference pass and travel fees . There was nowhere to eat at a somewhat fair price in the hotel . It made me feel even more outrage ##d at corporate capitalism . Stop supporting corporations who nickel and dim ##e you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and excellent accommodation ##s . The staff was outstanding , Will , at the front door , went above and beyond from the moment we stepped out of our U ##ber . Vince , our Bell ##man , was personal and so in tune to our needs . He greeted me by name every morning . Excellent experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My best friend and I stayed here for our yearly girls trip and we had such a great time ! The staff ( Hi Eric ##k G ! ! ! ) was so amazing and friendly ! Our room was absolutely stunning and the beds felt amazing ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of my favorite bout ##ique hotels in Chicago . The location is perfect right off the Chicago River and just a few blocks from Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park . Also walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago which is a must see . The lobby and the rooms have been recently re ##mo ##del ##ed and look great . Wine hour in the lobby from 5 to 6 always works as a nice way to start a fun evening . The people at Monaco are very helpful and friendly . If you go make sure to talk with the door ##man Peter . He has been there over 20 years and will take great care of you . He always had great suggestions and is just a great guy . Get a coup ##on from him for the Irish bar right across the street . My girlfriend and I had a great weekend at the Monaco . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First of all the location of this place is amazing ! Right in the heart of the amazing architecture and scenic views Chicago is known for . Just a block in each direction and you can be at the Chicago River or stepping out for a night on the town . A great mix of checking out the sites and feeling like a local ! The staff was friendly and always quickly available to help me find out my way around the town . I have to say I got the best food and drink recommendations via the hotel ' s In ##sta ##gram account and I have to say the compliment ##ary cocktail ##s in the lounge were an excellent added per ##k that I feel most hotels chose not too add . All - in - all my stay was both relaxing and advent ##urous and I ' ll definitely be back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a true class ##y hotel . It is a perfect mix of old school class coupled with modern convenience . The lobby had a soothing feel and a ##roma . The staff is kind and helpful . The rooms are imp ##ec ##ca ##bly clean and comfortable . Don ' t personally like [SEP]
0	[CLS] Con ##ven ##ient location , large and attractive rooms and bathroom ##s , and excellent service make this a great hotel . This is my third stay , and I ’ ll be back . The overall experience is of comfortable and casual luxury . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was spacious , clean , quiet , and had a great view . The staff was so friendly and helpful . The pool was huge but very deep - shallow end started at 4 . 5 feet . No door ##man but they called us a taxi and it was there within 10 minutes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed 4 nights at this hotel , whose location just off Michigan Avenue and half a block from Lakes ##hore Drive , could not have been better . The staff were exceptionally court ##eous and friendly and the bed was super - comfortable . On the whole , it was quiet and rest ##ful . The Nix Restaurant breakfast ##s were excellent . The furniture and carpet could use up ##dating but these are minor complaints . Re ##com ##men ##d highly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Dear Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal ##C ##hic ##ago , I would like to thank your con ##cier ##ge team Sylvia for making sure my plan where in order for a wonderful night out in town ! Thanks for having my stay a memorable stay & a shout out to v ##alet for making sure my transportation need where met ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a hi ##cc ##up in my reservation when I showed up at 10 PM , but Ruth resolved the issue for me pain ##lessly . Really appreciate it . I know it ’ s hard to maintain an even and polite attitude when a customer is irritated . Something about Ruth was calming . And the rooms of course are well appointed and comfortable . Great hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My partner and I chose Hotel All ##egro to host our wedding this past weekend and we could not be happier with our experience . The staff and wedding coordinator were incredible to work with . We received so many compliment ##s from our guests on the food , staff and overall venue am ##bian ##ce . The price was very competitive with other venues in the city . My parents also hosted a day after br ##unch as well , which exceeded expectations . If you are looking for a beautiful venue in Chicago , with excellent food and service , please check out the Hotel All ##egro ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location to walk to everything you can see or do in 3 days ! The room was larger than the pictures for a Double Queen River ##view appear online . Go for a higher floor . The window seat was perfect to enjoy the view . Jo ##in the member rewards for free w ##i - fi and ask for a gold ##fish to stay with you ! Nice surprise for the kids ! Happy hour in the lobby every evening . Small hotel with huge customer service ! I will never have to compare hotels again . I ' ll stay with Kim ##pton ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This Hotel is our favorite in the City . The staff is great , the hotel is a national treasure . The location is perfect for anything in the city you need to do . We are happy to be back and will return soon [SEP]
1	[CLS] Formerly my favorite retreat for a Chicago get ##away . If only I had known they eliminated the awesome pool , hot tub , favorite spot to Stay ##cation , I may not have been so disappointed . Great view of Navy Pier and So much more , but there was even a better view from the pool and great former work ##out floor . Now your best option is a corner room for a view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d staying here , beautiful grand hotel , renovated with modern amenities . Room was spacious , quiet , and bed ##ding new and comfortable . Park ##ing is expensive but worth it for the convenience . Even better is the location , short walk to Water Tower , , ( blocks ) short walk to art institute if you head south . ( blocks as well ) Staff were all nice as can be . [SEP]
1	[CLS] kept having problems with the com ##mo ##de not working properly they were fast in answering with maintenance but very in ##con ##ven ##ient going down 20 floors to use the rest ##room . also they need to air pu ##ri ##fy the rooms they have pets in so as not to to bother next person in room with all ##er ##gies no spa on location server in bar was rude and they do not give back all your change from drinks ! ! just not a 5 star stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location ( just north of the river ) . Great place to settle in as the staff is extra friendly and helpful ! They made us feel " at home ! " The kitchen ##ette is great if you don ' t want to go out and they have breakfast and social hour . The only con is the quality of the food . Thank you [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has been recently re ##mo ##del ##ed . The location is perfect . It is close to many great restaurants , shopping and the river . All the staff were helpful and friendly . Our son had stayed in this hotel last January and recommended it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was in a good location and very friendly to the kid ##dos . The suite was a nice option to allow some of the family to sleep in later than others . The only down ##side is the proximity to the children ##s hospital - - sire ##ns all night long . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to Chicago for our 8th Anniversary . What a wonderful experience to stay at The Talbot ##t . I found this hotel while searching on Google for hotels near Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . From check - in to check out it was a pleasure ! Everyone was so kind but a major shout out to D ##WA ##Y ##NE ! He is such an asset to The Talbot ##t ! He had all the answers and had super recommendations for places to eat , visit and sight see ! The bar was also fantastic ! Dr ##ink ##s were on point and so warm and welcoming ! The bathroom was huge and had a heat ##er ( we are from Miami so it was a plus ) as was the room . All very clean . I highly recommend you consider staying at The Talbot ##t . It ’ s not a large hotel but it was very quiet and q ##ua ##int and D ##WA ##Y ##NE ! He is the reason we will stay there again when we return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would not choose to stay at this hotel again . For one , it ' s clearly and old building that has had co ##sm ##etic upgrades to make it look modern . Unfortunately , things like the air conditioning barely work well enough to keep the room at a l ##ivable temperature in the Chicago summer ! You can hear A L ##OT of noise from your neighbors due to poor ins ##ulation . The plug ##s in the walls won ' t hold in a charge ##r so it ' s impossible to charge any kind of phone or laptop should you need to . It ' s also V ##ER ##Y FA ##R from the Ma ##g Mile to be considered part of that . Book ##ed through a Price ##line deal that said it was a " 4 - Star Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile Hotel " so be careful if you choose to book with them ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my 2nd stay at Chicago ' s O ##m ##ni Hotel - both lovely . The suites are very nice & comfortable . Everything you need . Location is very central to Miracle Mile , Lakes ##hore , etc . Shopping shopping shopping . My stays have been for conferences - excellent conference facilities , food & service but I would stay there for leisure as well . You can ' t go wrong with this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very me ##dio ##cre hotel . Dec ##or is a bit old fashioned Room was spacious but old & lacking up to date convenience ##s - - e ##g us ##b ports & ample plug ##s . Light ##ing is dim . Mini ##mal toilet ##ries . Bed is good . There is no restaurant & though they do provide coffee in the lobby & apparently breakfast food ( but later in the day than I could use it ) it ' s an in ##con ##ven ##ience . Overall I ' d give it a B . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check in was friendly and even enthusiastic . Room was clean and bed ##ding was great . Nice street view . Located right next to Cadillac Palace theater . Easy to get to from the train and easy to walk around the downtown loop area . S ##light train noise but did not disturb my sleep . Bath ##room sink area was a little tight but for me was fine . One night business trip and this hotel was an o ##asis after a taxi ##ng travel day . Front desk was helpful to get directions for dinner and how to get around . Coffee in the morning was good . Love ##d the lobby areas . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here a few nights early May and really liked it . Re ##ception was smooth and friendly , the rooms are really good value for a hotel in this category . The rooms were actually larger than average and well appointed . Had a few at the b ##our ##bon bar which was fun with the drink cart coming around and serving creative cocktail ##s for added entertainment . Good medium size gym and great location close to restaurants and shops . De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My beautiful wife and I had an early anniversary hotel stay in our own city . Check in was easy and professional . Once we were in our room , we received a text from the front desk . It was only a courtesy : asking how everything was going , however it was our easy interaction for the remainder of our stay . Any question we had was answered within seconds : why isn ' t the Blue ##tooth speaker louder - problem solved , need more tooth ##pas ##te and batteries - delivered . Really loved this stay , and happy to be using technology to keep privacy and p ##amp ##ering possible . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not only did the hotel have the wrong name on our room , it took me two phone calls to the hotel to get a re ##ceipt sent to me . The manager of the hotel was suppose to call me back but I never heard from them . The hotel was nice but I was very disappointed with the follow up response [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Ki ##nz ##ie instead of West ##in River North where a work conference was held . It was a lower rate at Ki ##nz ##ie with continental breakfast and just about a block away . It was very quiet and the staff all friendly and helpful . I did not have any problems that others noted . They did re ##fill the breakfast and the app ##eti ##zers at the bar , improving upon reviews . I stayed after the conference with my sister and walked the city . The hotel is central ##ly located to restaurants and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful time with our extended family at The Talbot ##t . The location is ideal with all of the amenities we needed for a memorable stay . The staff were warm and inviting . We will all definitely recommend and return . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a wonderful time at this hotel . The staff was extremely kind and helpful ( De ##met ##rius at the front desk is awesome ! ) We will definitely be returning next time we ’ re in Chicago . The rooms are spacious and very clean , the pool is gorgeous , and the fitness room is great ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Well , everything went perfect I actually chose your hotel for the night of my birthday among others ##ex ##c ##lus ##iv ##ley be ##cs ##use i am s gold member for ex ##ped ##ia and it was a v ##ip treatment hotel . Its the first time i don ##t get an upgrade . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved this location . The staff was generally friendly . The rooms are small and poorly situated , you can ' t reasonably use the closet ##s as the bed is right up against the doors . There was a very loud party on our floor until 5 ##AM and the staff said too bad , they don ' t / won ' t request that guests be polite or quiet . Got very little sleep due to the madness . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Connie Alex in the club room / lounge was excellent . She was very friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and a hard worker . She made our stay very pleasant ! You don ##t always meet staff that will go above and beyond to reach out to customers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay . Close and convenient to shopping and great restaurants staff was professional and at ##ten ##tive room and bed was comfortable on Friday for check ##out door ##man was extremely helpful and pleasant [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel stay , super a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff and compliment ##ary Pro ##se ##cco ! Beautiful room and setting , lobby is comfortable and inviting . Would definitely stay here again when visiting Chicago for business . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I brought our kids downtown for the Air and Water Show . Hotel location is close to Mill ##eni ##um Park , Navy Pier River Walk . We got early check in and we ’ re able to come and go which was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this historic hotel . Family trip to Chicago . . . Met two other groups . Room was perfect , morning breakfast was well provision ##ed , and staff were all helpful . While we enjoyed the lobby bar , the t ##v could not get the Cubs game . . . disappointed that the Chi ##town excitement did not make it into the hotel that night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for about a week for a conference and leisure in Chicago . Overall a great location although the hotel feels a little old with regards to the decorations and furniture in the rooms . The fitness center is nice although the t ##read ##mill ##s need to be cleaned . The steak house and restaurant on the lower lever are very over priced . I appreciated the fact that you could order extra towels , pillows and etc through a text message . The hotel staff was nice , however nothing above and beyond . I am a gold member however that meant absolutely nothing at this hotel . No room upgrade or additional per ##ks . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying at the Intercontinental and it was everything we hoped for . Our room ( Executive King Tower City View ) had 2 amazing views of the city and an employee gave us a personal tour of the hotel , which was awesome to hear all the history of it . We ate breakfast at Center Court both days - the made to order o ##mel ##ets and wa ##ffles were superb ! Dinner at the Michael Jordan ’ s St ##eak ##house was also delicious - and our waitress was super friendly and even surprised me with a special birthday message on our dessert . The location was perfect for all the shopping and eating we wanted to do as well ! We will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was stay in the hotel , the room is very good and comfortable and best location . Near to the all store for shopping and near to best restaurant in downtown . I am really stay for more than a week and I was happy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here before , this hotel maintains its high quality . We were upgraded to a king suite which was ideal . Only fl ##aw is how very small the bathroom is . Love the prose ##cco at wine hour , totally fits with the hotel theme . If you are in Chicago for the theater as we were , I would totally recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have just returned from Chicago and had the pleasure of staying in this hotel . The hotel is in a great location and is within walking distance of museums , shopping , restaurants , the beach and other tourist ##y interests . All of the hotel staff were amazing and could not have been more helpful . We were very lucky to have our room upgraded as we were celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary . The hotel staff even provided a bottle of b ##ub ##bly and chocolate covered straw ##berries which were gorgeous and completely unexpected . We would definitely return to this hotel without hesitation and hope to do so next year ! ! Do not hesitate . . . book this hotel ! ! You will not regret it ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were surprised and delighted by the level of service that this hotel offered us on our recent visit to Chicago . Although we were disappointed to learn that with the recent renovation , the indoor pool was eliminated , the staff here really compensate ##d for that slight disappointment . Nicole at the front desk helped us find what to do , where to go and provided excellent service with a smile . The room was clean , the elevators were efficient and most importantly , the staff members at this property were properly trained to greet and assist their guests with genuine care and concern . Special shout - out to Nicole and her front desk staff for a job well done . We came as guests and left as friends ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just wanted to give John a special mention on top of all the other staff that did a brilliant job . John made our hotel stay that bit special . Every ##time he ' s been at the door , whether we were coming into or out of the hotel he was amazing . My kids were drawn to him and he always took the time to ask them where they were going or where they just came from . He always had things to share with us about Chicago . If I had been the owner of a hotel , I would sure to stealing him from She ##rato ##n ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was at the Talbot for a business stay . It was excellent ! Food , service and rooms all exceeded s expectations . Was also in a very convenient location for seeing the city . Would recommend and stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would not stay here again . Price is way out of line with the facility and service profile . Interior King for more than $ 400 . 00 - no street view . R ##ook was spare - nothing to write on , cheap fixtures . Ex ##pect ##ed to be charged to park the car but was not informed of cost until check out . If you are going to charge your customers this much , you have to raise the level of your services substantially . Room was clean and that is about it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very satisfied with my stay . My room was clean and comfortable , the staff was friendly , and check - in / check - out was fast and sea ##m ##less . My only issue was the fact that there is no breakfast service available in the hotel other than the Star ##bu ##cks . I was meeting a friend and former colleague for breakfast the day of my departure for a long conversation , and we had to go across the street to the Mar ##riot ##t . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an old classic hotel ( Ambassador East & the P ##ump Room Restaurant ) , which has been nicely re - done ( Ian S ##hra ##eg ##ger ) . My daughter and I found the room quite comfortable . We enjoyed the great value with our room rate , enjoyed the lovely old large room ( double beds ) and the fantastic location . The library was a nice spot for breakfast . I ' d imagine these rooms would be fantastic for families as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had several issues with the hotel , they did try to fix some , but overall disappointed . Key card app did not work which created problems . Book ##ed 6 rooms , one of which upon arrival was only partially clean . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Upon entering the hotel , we were delighted with the friend ##liness and e ##ff ##ici ##ancy of the staff . Upon entering our room , we were highly impressed with the design , clean ##liness and comfort . We will highly recommend The Talbot ##t Hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for a business trip . The location was perfect and the unique triangular design of the hotel was easy to identify when out and about . It is close to many places that a tourist would visit but also accessible to the business areas of down ##t ##won . What I loved the most about the hotel was the bed and bed linen ##s ! I slept better than at home ! This is a place I will definitely stay at again in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly Hotel . Fantastic position . 10 minute walk to N Michigan Ave for shopping , easy walk to Navy Pier , easy walk over bridge to the Bean and Mill ##eni ##um Park . Would definitely stay again if ever in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel . . although they lacked the basic amenities that I expect when traveling like a business center of a coffee maker in the hotel room . Do to CO ##VI ##D they were still not offering any room service for towels etc I chose to stay here because of a promotion through H ##ya ##tt . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Chicago Hilton and its staff went above and beyond to make us feel as special as any President that stayed here before us . Room was im ##ma ##culate , staff was pleasant and curious , food was delicious with all the l ##ux ##uries of a perfect mini vacation in a beautiful city . High ##ly recommended if you want to feel like royalty on your next trip . Thank you Chicago Hilton . . . . your team rocks ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love the subdued sophisticated design of the public spaces and the guest rooms of the P ##U ##BL ##IC Chicago . The place has charm . But what makes me want to come back is the at ##ten ##tive ##ness and friendly attitude of the staff . I was here for a company business meeting ( held in the hotel ' s meeting space ) , and every staff person ( front desk , bell ##man , housekeeper , catering , security , etc . ) was pleasant and engaging , and seemed genuinely interested in making sure my stay was pleasant and that I had everything I needed . If you plan to stay in the Gold Coast area of Chicago , you should definitely check this place out ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I visit Chicago often for business travel and even the most routine of mid - week stays is made special by the people at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago ! Hospital ##ity , thoughtful ##ness and service makes this my favorite hotel in the city , and one I measure all others by . Thank you to the employees of the hotel for making this such a great place to call home when I am on the road ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were greeted by Ka ##cey when we checked in , and from the start , I knew we were going to have a great experience at the place . Room ##s were stock ##ed with everything we needed and there were many electrical outlets for all of us . Alicia in house ##keeping was wonderful and ensured we had enough toilet ##ries for our stay . Rafael and Omar made great drinks . During prose ##cco hour , Sandy was very patient and even cooperative with my friends and I while we took forever to capture the best boom ##eran ##g of her pour ##s . The only down ##side of the place . . . elevators were slow . Besides that , it was a great hotel and I hope to be back one day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ambassador ##s of welcoming . From first entering the lobby of this iconic hotel and restaurant until pulling away in our car , our family and friends experienced such a welcoming atmosphere , excellent service , great gathering spaces , and first class restaurant and catering . Every guest expressed satisfaction with their rooms and their stay . Perfect venue for a wedding weekend when people from all over gather . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone made me feel welcome from the moment I pulled up in a C ##ab . We had the Gold room and the lounge was wonderful to always have drinks and snack ##s on hand . The advice and su ##gg ##eti ##os we received made the don ##w ##time from business enjoyable . Don ' t turn away mini ##bar service , even if you did not use your mini ##bar , they are the ones who stock the coffee . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a world class hotel in a great location . Chelsea and Ava at the front desk were absolutely delight ##ful and made the trip even better . I would recommend that anyone who travels to Chicago stay at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at The Talbot ##t Hotel for 2 nights 24th / 25th June . It was the best hotel we have stayed in out of 22 hotels / motel ##s in our past 3 holidays in the USA . From the bell boy / man , to the waitress ##es in the restaurant , to the reception staff - everyone was ready to help . The room was spot ##less , comfortable , bar / fridge well stock ##ed in the room , and the bathroom was all one would wish for including a lit s ##having mirror . The ON ##L ##Y thing that I could possibly find to moan about was the view from the window which was a stone wall - and I have seen worse walls . Chicago is a f ##abulous city so why spend time in your room looking out ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great staff - Travis and Rachel were extremely helpful ! They gave us a list of “ must see ’ s ” in the city ! Co ##zy room , awesome beds . Love ##ly weekend for my girlfriend and I ! Will certainly recommend to others ! The bar in booth one was super cute , y ##um ##my cocktail ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a super clean , ch ##ique hotel . I was very surprised coming into the lobby . The thing I would say is upon coming to front door , I had ask where to check in . The front lobby is actually up the stairs or you can take the elevator to the lobby . The staff was friendly and court ##eous . Check in was quick . The room felt ups ##cale f ##rench with the ch ##and ##elier and dim ##mable lamps . The room was very clean and all amenities were available such as iron ##ing board etc . I would definitely stay here again . Its location is fantastic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location , clean rooms , at ##ten ##tive enough staff but considering the price and " status " of this place you ' d expect more than that . Room wasn ' t anything special at all . Bed was comfortable but I don ' t remember the last place I ' ve stayed at where the bed was uncomfortable . Am ##eni ##ties offered are typical . I expect every decent hotel to be clean and there are plenty of places in Chicago with excellent locations so nothing really stood out here . Staff was nice but seemed like they were under ##sta ##ffed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great location with great rooms . Staff are always friendly and efficient . The good service commence ##s from the minute you arrive . Nothing is too much trouble . It has a great swimming pool as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you like old school hotels with a 1930s feel , this place is great . The rooms have been nicely updated . There is a good fitness room . The breakfast was excellent ( paid extra ) . The staff very a ##cco ##mo ##dating . Located a block from Michigan Ave , two blocks from the lake front . The rooms were extremely cheap price - wise . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the outside the hotel Lila the part , but the interior is very tired , as are the rooms . We were there for a conference ( the hotel had three conferences on at the same time ) so as a lot of the meetings were over coffee , the reception we got from the restaurant and bars in the morning when all we asked for was for coffee , was long sighs and raised eyebrows ! ! Not pleasant and certainly not friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location good . Club room not worth extra cost . Most basic we have ever experienced . Never been in a club room where a glass of wine is $ 12 ##p ##lus tax and tip . We should have had a newly renovated room on high floor . Our room was not newly renovated and to use the club room meant we had to go down transfer to another lift to go to the club room . After complaining we were moved to a higher floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at The Chicago Fair ##mont several times . We always enjoy the Gold Floor with a great breakfast , afternoon re ##f ##resh ##ments and evening Ho ##rs d ’ O ##eu ##vres ! Always friendly service and extremely comfortable rooms with a great view of the Lake . A very special thanks to Con ##cier ##ge Gail Walker for assistance in making our stays Me ##mor ##able ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 3 nights at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for our Sister Weekend and had a great time . The room was clean and comfortable and was recently updated . I enjoyed the rain shower . The beds and pillows were very comfortable . We did notice that the carpet was in need of cleaning . I also think that W ##i ##F ##i could have been included with our room . The staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker served our needs but I ' m not sure I would stay again . It was fine , but nothing special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful stay . Friendly staff . Could not have asked for more . Room was great . Co ##m ##fort ##able and spacious rooms . Great bar . Really nice ballroom . Great location . Would recommend in the highest regard . Thanks ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff here are great , very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and professional . My rooms were clean and had a nice vintage look . Love that unique style about this hotel . Nice relaxing and peace of mind get away . Will definitely be back soon [SEP]
0	[CLS] Absolutely phenomena ##l ! From the front desk staff to the maid ##s to the meal servers , E ##VE ##R ##Y ##ON ##E was so nice and helpful and friendly . Everything was clean and well kept . Our request for rooms on the same floor was honored . We were a family of 10 that occupied 3 rooms and we were so very pleased with this Home ##wood Suite ##s and would highly recommend this place to anyone going to Chicago , especially with children ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came in Labor day weekend for a music festival . While the location was great for us , the hotel was just me ##h . The bathroom mirror was filthy , and the door didn ' t close , in fact the handle fell off . The mug ##s were dusty and not re ##ple ##nish ##ed after use . Staff in the lobby was sparse . The fact that we couldn ' t put any of our own drinks in a mini - fridge in the room was problematic as well . For the money , next time I will stay somewhere else . We were disappointed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We normally stay at Hilton ’ s because we haven ’ t had a bad experience . This time around was not the case . Very noisy hotel . You can hear your neighbor talking . Door ##s slamming . People leave they room service tray ##s out in the hall and no staff picks them up for days . Not enough towels for two people . The size of the Pi ##llow ##s a for children and beds were not comfortable . Overall I was not happy with the price I paid for this crap ##py of a stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All you will need for high end or everyday shopping but only in ion ##e mile Clean , safe , All is near John Hank ##ok building , 5 stories Nike Store , multiple mall ##s to include the Water Tower . Just come when t ##ge weather is right [SEP]
1	[CLS] The place is great . The suites are perfectly sized and a great base to su ##port exploring the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and all the Wind ##y City has to offer . Walking distance from many of Chicago ' s best shops , restaurants and parks The staff was also great : very friendly and helpful . There was this door ##man ( whose name I regret ##fully can ##´ ##t remember , but who sport ##ed the cool ##est handle - bar must ##ache ##s ever ) that was always very nice to us , although shocked we decided on purpose to visit Chicago during winter ! He was also nice enough to tell us when the compliment ##ary hot c ##ider on the lobby was replaced - so we could make a short stop there while s ##tro ##lling Michigan Ave . for a quick sip to warm us up . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a place we ' ll be back whenever we decide to visit Chicago again . Probably next winter ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was very nice from our welcome at check - in to a nice large clean room . Staff was very helpful . We were tired from a long day of painting and cleaning an empty con ##do and the hotel felt like a little bit of home ; co ##zy , quiet and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for the Chicago Half Marathon . The hotel is well appointed and has an extra ##va ##gant lobby . During our stay there was a strike going on which effect ##ed the restaurants and house ##keeping staff ##ing . Even with these short staff ##ing issues the hotel handled it quite well . They made sure to check on you for everything and that your stay was a good one . We stayed in a suite with two bathroom ##s and two beds which was a very nice size room . Would definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly spacious rooms were imp ##ec ##ca ##bly clean . Bath ##room had huge double van ##ity . Power window covering ##s , unlimited compliment ##ary bottle ##d water was very much appreciated . Never had to wait long for the elevators . Located in the heart of my favorite restaurants and shopping locations . Very luxurious . Will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and exceptional service ! The room was outstanding - great bed & linen ##s , super spacious , tons of amenities and the bathroom was awesome ( and huge ! ) . At ##tending meetings at the hotel that were cater ##ed and the food was top notch . The rooftop bar was awesome too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perry the door man was excellent and deserves the world ! He was always kind and so helpful , he is a truly authentic person , I rarely write reviews but he was the best and the hotel was amazing , probably the best hotel I ’ ve ever stayed at . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was very clean and well setup ( the desk in a separate area ) F ##abulous view of river and lake . A ##pp ##re ##cia ##ted coffee maker in room . H ##ya ##tt Lounge was convenient and helpful . Check in was fast although big crowd had arrived at the same time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , it was nearby all of the restaurants we went to and was within walking distance of all the major shopping areas . Our bed was very com ##fy and the service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble . Everyone we encountered was very nice and at ##ten ##tive . The lobby bar was also very good , I would recommend grabbing drinks here . My only complaint would be that the room didn ' t meet my expectations . We didn ' t need anything , but I just expected a different look and feel . But this wouldn ' t de ##ter me from recommend ##ing this hotel , it ' s a personal opinion only and wasn ' t what I had in mind . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very central ##ly located , nice interior and very nice staff . We were upgraded to a junior suite with a great view . We very much enjoyed the stay . Only weak point were breakfast . Quality was good , but waiting time most often too long . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent the week there and Eddie at the bar was fantastic ! He gave great suggestions for restaurants and was always at ##ten ##tive . Service was above the bar ! Eddie ##s always was there with a smile and jokes as well re ##fill ##ing drinks whenever needed . I would recommend the Swiss ##ote ##l for business needs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fort ##able , s ##ty ##lish , and very clean ; what a te ##rri ##fic place to stay for an anniversary weekend . The hotel lobby is beautiful in an under ##state ##d way . The staff is very friendly and helpful . Our room was well decorated with a large marble bathroom , and comfortable reading chairs next to a window overlooking the city . The bed ##ding was very clean and oh so comfortable ; it was so easy to fall asleep . There were no loud disturbance ##s and no loud neighbors . House ##keeping was excellent and friendly . The location of the hotel couldn ' t be better , with easy walking to numerous restaurants . There was only one liquor store that we found to be walking distance and it had a limited selection , so that was the only ( minor ) draw ##back . Close to the train ( walk ##able ) . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the moment you walk in , you are in complete awe ! ! ! It is so beautiful and well decorated ! It ' s modern yet historical all in one . The ballroom ##s are amazing ! I stayed bet ##e for a conference and everything was wonderful ! The rooms had two bathroom ##s which was very convenient . The food was great ! The staff was very friendly and helpful no matter what . I love the fact that they take guest safety very serious and did not allow non - guests access to the rooms after a certain period of time . There was someone monitoring the entrance to the elevators in the evening . This particular hotel has so much history which is displayed in the hotel . I learned so much during the tour of the hotel . This property is simply amazing ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This establishment probably has the best location for those folks visiting Chicago . 1 1 / 2 blocks off Michigan Ave , close to all forms of public transport , all forms of restaurants within an easy walk . Full kitchen suites , very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , full hot breakfast , and an evening hot snack ##s with drinks . This has everything for family visits . In One word perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , great price , friendly faces at Christmas time ! This place is all about the details . Check out their hot co ##coa and coffee bar every morning . The robes in the bathroom , along with great smelling shower gel , s ##ham ##po ##o , and condition ##er . They also let you mail post cards for free ! Their 1922 Montgomery ward catalog is a no ##stal ##gic blast from the past while you lounge on the comfortable sofa and sip your coffee . Thank you Hotel All ##egro for an exceptional stay , you make my heart warm at Christmas ( despite the freezing te ##mps outside ) ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay here each and every time we stay in Chicago . We don ' t consider any other hotel . Great location in the city and wonderful treatment by staff . Restaurant ##s , shopping , and sights ##ee ##ing are all within walking distance . Any further needs are offered by the exceptional team of staff members . The beds are wonderful to sleep on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] my room was dirty , stain ##s on the wall , sticky phone handle , dust covered shelves and chair arms . The bed linen ##s smelled on smoke . Food for the conference was pit ##iful , with lack of variety and poor quality . The hallway ##s around the conference room and exhibit halls smelled of mild ##ew . Always ran out of hot water for tea at every re ##f ##resh ##ment break . Overall the worst catering and facilities for any conference I have ever attended . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a very comfortable stay at this hotel and I will definitely recommend it to all the tourist visit in Chicago this hotel is simply amazing and the hotel is right at the centre and the heart of the city . A big thumbs up [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed here recently for a business trip . The building has an old school feel and look with a great mix of new technology and amenities . The food we had at each of our events was fresh and great tasting . High ##ly recommend it for both business functions or a weekend get ##away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Del ##ight ##ful hotel set back from the noise and c ##raz ##iness of Michigan avenue . Friendly and warm staff that are available to assist . Room was clean and bed comfortable . Check with the Hotel before booking to see if both elevators are working , as this was a large in ##con ##ven ##ience when wanting to get to your room with only one elevator in service and a busy hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I visited family in the Chicago area over Christmas . We chose to spend Christmas afternoon and evening downtown and chose the Hilton on Michigan Ave to spend the evening . The staff was excellent and our room and view were first rate . Good job ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a fun little bout ##ique style hotel p ##lu ##nk ##ed right in the best part of downtown . Wine reception from 5 : 00 - 6 : 00 is fun but the window seats on the river view side are out of this world ! Service has been ou ##standing . I highly recommended staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie for 5 days during a business conference and had a great experience . Robert down at the front desk was so friendly and helpful . He gave me a great restaurant recommendation and printed out a map to help me find my way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Late night arrival after a delayed flight , missed dinner so after check - in I called room service . Del ##oris took my order and kindly added the details I requested to my salad and even went out of her way to find the crack ##ers I wanted for my soup ! Thank you Del ##oris ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 1 night with my husband and two to ##ddler boys . Location is great and the staff was friendly and helpful ! Room was comfortable and clean . There were several amenities offered but we only swam in the pool . Would definitely recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here while in town for work . Room ##s are extremely small and walls are pretty thing . I could hear my neighbor ' s television and phone conversations . Bath ##rooms are also incredibly small . This hotel is over ##p ##rice ##d for the quality . The rooms feel very old and out ##dated . The food at the bar in the lobby is all pre - made , not sure exactly when . It is also over ##p ##rice ##d and average . The staff is friendly , which is nice . Not worth the price for the accommodation ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a pre ##pa ##id room and came to the hotel one day later due to personal reason . Ex ##plain ##ed it to the front office manager Ke ##rby , he mention he will charge me again as I did not call him . I wanted to es ##cal ##ate this as the room was paid al ##red ##y but he agreed it was fine . In the end I was charged twice which is a qualified theft So far re ##clamation ##s on the phone are not possible I was constantly transfer ##ed and kept on hold . I tried on the mail and expecting replay [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was fine , could have used some additional help in posting stay for loyalty number which I did not have available . Hard to believe you couldn ' t find it with the number of emails that you send me on a regular basis . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was adequate . That ' s about it . Thought my booking said king . I was given a double bed . W ##oke up to gangster rap b ##lar ##ing at 4 : 00 am that lasted for awhile . We couldn ' t figure where it was coming from , I think the alley below us [UNK] All together not the best stay . Wouldn ' t re visit [SEP]
0	[CLS] We got hopeless ##ly lost trying to find its non ##des ##cript parking garage . Check ##ing took a long time as well . So my first impressions were not good . But the staff are extraordinary . They make sure you feel comfortable and have everything you need . Everyone here was amazing and the location was fantastic . You are so close to everything you want t see and do in Chicago . I will come back . Thank you for caring so much about my stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a comfortable hotel with great friendly staff . It is in a great position in Central Chicago and you can walk to all the attractions . It has a restaurant and coffee shop and there are also lots of restaurants around the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel is a hotel with a very nice atmosphere . The lobby and bar immediately give you a pleasant feeling . The staff is very friendly . Our room was very spacious and clean . Very good and comfortable bed , very large television . Our room overlooked an alley at the back of the hotel . Unfortunately this was a bit noisy ( garbage trucks I think ) . The hotel is very central . Just a few minutes ' walk from the Ma ##gin ##ifice ##nt Mile . I would definitely recommend The Talbot ##t for a stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed directly on O ##m ##ni ##hot ##els . com at best price , other sites had the same price , but book direct got upgrade offer for Governor ' s Suite for only $ 50 more per night . Very friendly staff upon arrival , during stay and departure . Got suite on 24th floor overlooking Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile , and view of the lake and city . Easy walking to all shopping , restaurants and movie house . Room services were great and fast . Room is very clean . Only problem with street ##no ##ice . Fire truck goes done the downtown area very regularly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel from March 2 through March 7 . Martin , the hotel manager , went out of his way to accommodate us with our requested room . Service was outstanding from every employee ; door ##man , house ##keeping , front desk , bartender , and even the maintenance person . Location couldn ’ t be better . I loved the layout of the room with a long desk bar in the bedroom and a full counter ##top in the bathroom ( no lo ##us ##y non - functional decorative p ##edestal sinks in this hotel ) . An empty refrigerator was available in the room , perfect for in room beverages . We ’ ve stayed here multiple times and look forward to returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Me and my husband live in the b ##ur ##bs and had a concert in the city . Dec ##ided to make a weekend of it and booked through third party within week before trip and got a great deal . We brought our sweet pu ##p , who was able to enjoy a wonderful nearby park with tons of green space ( a rare find in the city ) . The park was Beautiful ##ly landscape ##d & surrounded by residential mixed use buildings with a few awesome breakfast eat ##eries on the bottom level . We had a city view in a king sweet on the 3rd floor . We ’ ve never stayed in accommodation ##s this large downtown ! Bed was S ##O comfortable and air quality was good ( important factor for me ) . Overall great experience & friendly check - in . T ##ip : difficult to get to if you ’ re driving ( versus cab ) & unfamiliar with Upper / Lower W ##ack ##er Drive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great hotel . . . great location . . . price ##y bar and restaurant . . . better off with breakfast around the corner . . . great turn down service . clean rooms . . . great shower . . so ##m ##fy shades for privacy . close to great shopping and ch ##ica ##go river . . . architectural tour is a must .

1	[CLS] I stayed at The Conrad 4 days for a business seminar . This hotel is on the top of my list for for next trips in Chicago . The rooms are wonderful and sophisticated with digital control easily accessible to control AL ##L the lighting and the blind ##s . It has a great bar lounge are on the 20th floor , and an amazing rooftop bar with fireplace . The view is breath ##taking . The staff is world - class and the gym fully equipped with brand new equipment . I strongly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This beautifully restored Hotel is right off the Clark / Lake L and in the heart of downtown Chicago . Very spacious lobby and well appointed rooms . We were upgraded to a suite on the 19th floor for our 3 night stay which was really great considering how full the hotel was . As always super friendly Kim ##pton staff and excellent customer service . High ##ly recommend this property . Kim ##pton Ka ##rma is the best ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie while I was in Chicago to attend the Chicago Collective at the Me ##rch ##and ##ise Mart a few blocks away . The location was great because It was an easy walk to the Me ##rch ##and ##ise Mart and many good choices of restaurants from cheap to very expensive . The hotel staff is friendly , g ##rac ##ious , and helpful . My room was spacious , ups ##cale , and very comfortable . A good breakfast is convenient ##ly served each morning on each floor , and compliment ##ary cocktail ##s and snack ##s each evening are a great way to wrap up the day . I like this hotel and recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We moved to the 30th floor from the 12th floor . The move changed my opinion about the place . The view was magnificent from all 3 windows . The floor was private and very quiet , much appreciated . Thanks [SEP]
1	[CLS] We called ahead for an early check - in with the realization that we ' d be running late for a friend ' s wedding & would need a quick change . Just as advertised , we arrived with only 15 minutes to go before the blessed event . Our check - in was quick & efficient , the room was ready & we made the wedding with one minute to spare ! It was made possible by the a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff at the Ambassador . Many thanks . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Hotel is a great hotel at a central location . We were in Chicago to run the Chicago Marathon on Columbus weekend and this was a great location . It has a fantastic pool and fitness center and the staff is very helpful . The only complaint I have is that they do not have queen beds ( Full beds only ) and the carpet ##s in the hallway ##s are way O ##VE ##RD ##UE to be replaced . They are very well worn and it ' s time to replace them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Suite was excellent it provided what we needed and that was place for my wife and I , and our son had the living room with the pull ##out couch . The breakfast was delicious with the large ass ##ort ##ment of items to eat . Everything was close all that could be imagined was there within walking distance . The customer service from the hotel was top notch ! A good place to take the family for getting into the downtown for the weekend . Will be returning . . . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were lucky to have a mid - floor room overlooking Mill ##enia ##l Park and a quick walk ( few blocks ) from ##v ##t ##ge Famous Bean ! Bonus was we were there during Lal ##apa ##lo ##oz ##a and had a great view and could open our windows to hear it ! Bed ##s were very comfortable with super soft sheets , and the bathroom was well laid out and spacious . There is a safe , nice sized TV and a mini - bar . Word of caution for those with children : the bar is very expensive ! The lobby is beautiful and this is a popular Wedding Re ##ception V ##en ##ue * with good reason ! * We would definitely stay there again ! Pictures are : a view of Mill ##enia ##l Park and Lal ##apa ##lo ##oz ##a , outside of the hotel , picture of a room and a picture of the Bean . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had an amazing time at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago with an awesome location to every major tourist spot ( Navy Pier , The Bean , the museums , Buckingham fountain , etc . ) . The staff were really friendly including the cleaning staff . The hotel has many food options from eat - in restaurants to a small convenience store to the Club Access ( part of room rate if purchased ) . If you need something , you can text them and they ' ll respond within a couple of minutes plus the ease of checking in and out . I wanted something romantic for our 3 day honeymoon nor would I say they did anything to make it special but the hotel was still great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying at this bout ##ique hotel and from the moment we arrived the experience was wonderful . From the great hospitality from Bryan at check in to the happy hour sang ##ria and prose ##cco in the afternoon . I would highly recommend staying here if you have the opportunity . Its in the heart of the theater district and an easy walk or L ##y ##ft to nearby attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the hotel was wonderful ! it gave an intimate v ##ibe . our room was very large and loved the bar . coffee in the lobby every morning , and great food . This trip was with my sister and we checked in and immediately started walking the area . The Talbot ##t is located in a wonderful area with great food close by ( walking distance ) , and shopping a few blocks away , also walking distance . Michigan a ##ve is very busy and noisy so the hotel was just the right distance away to avoid the noise but take advantage of the shopping . Also shopping in the same block . The staff were warm and welcoming and the hotel was very comfortable , had good beds . I will stay at this hotel when I come back for sure . Now that I understand the area it is un ##beat ##able as far as comfort and value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I called the Con ##cier ##ge to receive directions br ##o the hotel from Midway Airport . The con ##cier ##ge gave me the wrong train directions from Midway airport to the hotel . Over ##shot my exit by 7 stops . So far a BA ##D experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just spent 8 days in Chicago . Great city to holiday in with lots to see and do . Architectural cruise is a must . So inform ##ative . Art Institute very good . Stay ##ed at Home ##wood Suite ##s , our 5th stay with this chain . Very comfortable hotel with friendly helpful staff . ( special thanks to Diana , V ##hin ##ce , Barbara and G ##uad ##el ##upe ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is a great place to stay . We loved our visit for our business trip . The staff thinks of every detail , they were court ##eous and helpful . We received texts welcoming us , checking in to see if we needed anything and even wished us a good night ! The free breakfast had fresh past ##ries , fruit , cereal ##s and more , plenty to fill us up for our busy day . We will definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I never give a five but the only reason we didn ' t was because the continental breakfast was a little bit average . The past ##ries each morning were s ##tale . Don ' t get me wrong , we were grateful for the fact it was easily accessible given there is not a restaurant at the property . And that we could get a cup of tea without having to venture out . But the staff were f ##abulous , the beds super com ##fy and a very Chicago v ##ibe about the place . If you are looking for somewhere small and bout ##ique like this is it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I actually feel kind of bad giving it only three stars because I got a good deal on a room , and people were very nice . You should be aware that it is an older historic hotel . Like every hotel I seem to stay in lately , lighting is awful . ( I ' m in town for business meetings - kinda need to see what my makeup looks like in normal light ! ! ) I did get a great deal on a room , but for my next business trip to Chicago I ' ll try a different hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing staff in particular W ##ah ##ei ##d He ##lm ##y at the reception . . very ho ##sp ##ita ##ble and inform ##ative . . gave us very good recommendations to sights in the city and restaurants . . I honestly judge Hotels by their service . . and the service can only be described as exceptional [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for my son ’ s wedding weekend and I have nothing but good things to say . Hotel was beautiful , rooms were spacious . Great breakfast . Good service / v ##alet parking . I highly recommend the Hilton ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Right from the get go the staff ( Leah ) was warm and welcoming ! She started the visit off right ! ! Great location ! ! ! We will definitely stay here again ! Room ##s are small but lovely decorated . 312 restaurant is a quick walk with wonderful am ##bie ##nce and great food ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The message is very simple : The whole staff - team of the hotel is very nice and friendly , as is customary and usual in the Fair ##mont Hotels , particularly in the club lounge . However , the reviews must indicate the lacks . This hotel is a bit anti ##qua ##ted and the decoration of the lo ##by it is old - fashioned , also the rooms . I know that it is a hotel of 4 stars not a hotel of luxury , but . . . a renovation is necessary It has a ma ##gni ##ficient sit ##ua ##ti ##o . n close to the Millennium Park . And a last advice , P ##LE ##AS ##E , we cannot speak about good energetic management with the lights and TV ignited like normal ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , friendly staff , and a relaxing welcoming room . En ##joy ##ed the stay and will glad ##ly return . The shower and linen ##s were great to recover and relax with after a b ##list ##ering cold Chicago day . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff were very helpful . The food at the conference cocktail hour was the best I have had at this type of event , and servers were really pleasant . There was a problem with my check - out date and the hotel resolved the problem in my favor . A most enjoyable stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located in River North , walking distance to ups ##cale restaurants and The River ##walk , it is a great location . Every part of the hotel is clean , the breakfast and evening snack ##s are a nice bonus . The staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay . There is street noise but that may be the case in any urban hotel . The room was quiet otherwise even with our room being on the same floor as the dining room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I got my iPhone stolen by a cleaning lady . I dropped my phone on a couch in the lobby by the elevators very late at night ( no one was around but the cleaning lady ) . I went back two minutes later and it was gone . I tried tracking it and it was T ##UR ##NE ##D OF ##F . In the morning the next day I checked the tracking and it was now last on in River ##dale , Illinois , which is about 25 minutes from the hotel . The staff did not really do anything about it , they just kept asking other staff if a phone was turned in and then told me they would contact me if they found it . If you go here , keep in mind you might get things stolen , and the staff is gonna do nothing about it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One night here and wanted to be longer . Room was so large by Chicago standards . Staff friendly and all necessary elements of a great hotel there . Lo ##bby is on the 8th floor w ##hi ##x ##h is unusual but fine . Great breakfast offered also . Love ##ly views of the city and if shopping the location is the best . Just on ma ##g like . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome experience ! My daughter and I stayed at the Fair ##mont for an event in Grant Park . We loved the location and had an awesome experience . The hotel staff were friendly and helpful , the rooms were clean , the bed was incredibly comfortable , and I would recommend it to anyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice rooms - very big - just missing coffee maker in the room . Has candy for sale - but no co ##fe ##e maker and no coffee in the lobby until 6 : 30 ##am . Not best for business travels . otherwise hotel is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed two night at the ambassador hotel , which is nicely located . The entrance is nice and the port ##ers are very friendly . The check in was slow and the check out as well , and the fact that the counters are solid and the staff can ’ t really walk around them makes is a bit clumsy . The rooms themselves are big and space . However the bathroom ##s look a bit like “ badly re ##pa ##inted ” and the bath tub was chip ##ped . Generally the rooms are comfortable , and the beds Are very good , but some of the items are a little run down . I have been staying a quite a few hotels in Chicago , and this has a great location , both for a nice morning run at the lake or a nice dinner in the nice ##r part of Chicago . It ’ s all walking distance . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el had a lot to offer . We only stayed one night so we did not get to take advantage of the great restaurant and bar . The service was very good . The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was huge with a separate tub and shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hidden hotel with a unique feel to it . Staff was helpful . Only complaint would be the room view was right against a window but to be expected . Very well priced for the room . Within walking range of many things to do . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great hotel for us . Service was excellent and the location was perfect for shopping and dining . The bar was pretty price ##y , but the hotel took great care of us , so no complaints overall . I would recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ m always on the hunt for good skin services . Living in the city , my skin gets rough and c ##log ##ged from all the environmental factors . Co ##up ##le being someone someone with sensitive skin , I struggle to find someone whose able to give me an effective facial without leaving my skin red and irritated . Alexis is a skin ##care angel sent from above ! She was incredibly educated on all the products used and easily swap ##ped out products that she suspected would i ##rri ##tate my skin . Not only was my skin irritation free at the end of my visit , but I kept getting compliment ##s on how clear , glow ##y , and glass - like my skin looked afterwards . I immediately booked another appointment with Alexis ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was tremendous ! Very kind and helpful . The hotel itself was em ##ac ##ula ##nt ! Beautiful views and comfortable beds . Location was absolutely perfect for getting everywhere we needed to go on foot . I ' m definitely going to be staying here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] check in lines were horrible had to pay twice ( $ 79 , $ 82 ) for parking because i reserved v ##alet parking online and was told at the hotel online only covered self park . check in person said " tough " parking staff was nice [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you like waking to the sounds of the L train c ##latter ##ing outside your window , this is the place for you . If you like sounds of mice or rats s ##cu ##rry ##ing in the wall behind you ( hotel claims it was maintenance on the exterior of the building , but I think not ) , this is the place for you . And if you like paying more than $ 300 a night for this awful am ##bie ##nce , this is the place for you . I regularly stay at Kim ##pton Hotels but I will never return to this one . R ##ude and under ##sta ##ffed front desk , s ##ni ##ppy manager , and din ##gy , dark , dated interior de ##cor ##ating . Go somewhere else and enjoy the ma ##rve ##lous city of Chicago . The Kim ##pton Pa ##lo ##mar is just a few block away , much nice ##r , rooftop pool and deck , bright interior and $ 100 less per night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Two day get - a ##wy from Colorado m ##t ##ns , for a city fix & live theater . Love ##d the ups ##cale & q ##ua ##int location in the gold coast . Staff was super engaging & friendly . Spa ##cious guest rooms & funk ##y bar / restaurant . Just wish we could have stayed longer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay at this wonderful hotel . While we were not able to part ##ake of the prose ##cco serving ##s , every aspect of our stay was te ##rri ##fic . The staff , from reception to bell service , were genuinely helpful , the room details , such as toilet ##ries and robes , appreciated , and the location and am ##bie ##nce were equally delight ##ful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our check in took over 45 minutes . We booked our room in May for an October stay and when we arrived we were told the room was not available due to being over ##book ##ed . We had to speak to numerous people to finally get the room we had originally booked . The room was dirty and the safe was broken . The floors looked like they hadn ' t been cleaned / vacuum ##ed in some time and the bathroom was also dirty . The sheets seemed clean , but the bathroom towels had a must ##y smell and some even had stain ##s on them . This was for a convention stay , so we expected much better . The food and beverage selection was good , but extremely expensive . Need ##less to say , we will be staying somewhere else during our next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed Memorial Day weekend at the Ambassador for three nights . Great stay overall . Con ##ven ##ient ##ly located , historic , and fantastic service . Walking distance to the beach , Lincoln Park Zoo , and the Loop . Will stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of my best hotel experiences in the city in terms of location , service , room decoration , fitness center , dinner and breakfast , w ##if ##i , bathroom amenities , accessories , etc . High ##ly recommended . I ' ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I went to one of our favorite cities , Chicago , and we had a great package offer with Air ##fare at She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago . With its te ##rri ##fic location on the river , very close to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave the choice was easy . We used the work ##out facilities and they were really nice , having worked out at a lot of gym ##s , that is easy to say . I even tried to surprise my wife with a bottle of champagne and cheese plate setup in the room before our arrival . When checking out I didn ' t see it on the f ##olio . When I asked the check out desk representative ( all the staff were consistently nice ) said it was taken care of and hoped that we would be back . The answer to that question is easy as well , we certainly will . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the O ##m ##ni 8 / 27 / 17 - 8 / 28 / 17 and could not have been more impressed ! Our stay was completely amazing ! We booked under the American girl doll package . My granddaughter was welcomed with a special note and gift . We left the room to visit the American girl doll store and came back to treats that were set out in the room . They also provided milk and cookies before bed . The O ##m ##ni does customer service to perfection ! ! ! ! ! ! We ate dinner at 67 ##6 in the hotel which was delicious ! added bonus was the restaurant is farm to table with a sign of where they source their food from . The room was beautiful and very comfortable . Thank you so much ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had a wonderful time in Chicago , and the staff at the Ken ##zie Hotel were so amazing ! They greeted you every time you wake ##d in the door . Whenever we needed something , they made sure they helped . The room was amazing , and well taken care of . I would recommend this hotel to everyone . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a delight ##ful hotel in a great location . I thoroughly enjoyed my stay . Service was outstanding and the bed was extremely comfortable . In addition my room was very quiet . I attended a conference in the beautiful ballroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Second time staying and I haven ' t been disappointed . Check - in was nice and fast , room was big and clean . W ##if ##i was fast . I will definitely stay again . Pre ##fect location if you want to be close to the action . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here the day after Thanksgiving . Great place , good location . Very pleased with the fact that they gave us the room before 11 am . Corner room had a wonderful wrap around view of the Chicago River and Navy Pier area . Room was also spacious . Other highlights include a nice gym with a wonderful view on 43 ##rd floor . Great exercise equipment , including 2 P ##elo ##ton bikes . The Palm Restaurant is also part of the hotel . Great steak ##house that rivals all the others . Wonderful selection of cocktail ##s as well . Only hang ##up during our stay was the fact that the room was missing bath towels . Mi ##sta ##kes happen . No harm no foul . We ’ ve stayed at about 7 hotels in Chicago . This is a great option and a fair price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for two nights in the middle of summer . The location is right in the heart of things . We had an upgraded room which was FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C . The on - site restaurant provides excellent room service for a very modest fee - much better than the typical over ##cha ##rg ##ing that happens at most hotels . But the really N ##IC ##E thing about this hotel is the staff and , particularly , the door ##man . What ? Door ##men ? Yu ##p . We dealt with 3 different door ##men during our stay and they were very welcoming and friendly . They made coming and going pleasant and truly made us want to come back to the hotel . I wish I had remembered to write down their names . . . but I hope their management will share this shout - out to them . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 2 nights here over s ##t pat ##ty ##s weekend . The 15 of us could not have picked a better place to stay . The service . . . . from the front desk to the door ##man out front were AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! ! ! They were so helpful and at ##ten ##tive to us when we were planning on our adventures for each day To top it off the . location was perfect and our room clean and comfortable . th ##x for a great stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for work for a week in a club room on the top floor with great views of the Chicago River . The room was a good size and we could easily access the club lounge from a door on the same floor . The hotel has a bi ##stro and steak restaurant as well as a Star ##bu ##cks and a small convenience store . There is a pool and a gym on the 7th floor It ' s not as modern as some hotels in the area , but it ' s a typical She ##rato ##n which does seem to have functions on in the ballroom most weekends . It ' s location at the start of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile on the river is very convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel needs loads of improvements . Very tired rooms , old carpet ##s ( specially in the corridors ) and above all not the best customer service . . . specially at reception , where some of the staff shouldn ’ t be facing customers as they are quite rude . Location is great but the hotel overall is a no from me . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el Chicago provides excellent rooms with amazing views over Chicago . Sit ##uated a few blocks away from the water tower , this perfect hotel is located one block away from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and just about four blocks away from Lake Michigan . The hotel has the classic , modern , So ##fit ##el - style fur ##nish ##ing and is equipped with great paintings , spacious and bright bathroom ##s and very soft beds . The extraordinary French breakfast , served on the ground floor , has to be mentioned as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great suite , a living area and bedroom and very modern bathroom . This suite was beyond our expectation . The view are amazing as we were on the 36 floor , we did request a lake view but only if I has my bin ##oc ##ular and could sq ##uin ##t to the left could I see the lake but the buildings made up for it . The pool is very small but add ##iq ##uit ##e if you don ' t swim or sun ##bat ##he just go up to see the 360 degree view . Staff very helpful and friendly especially our cleaning lady . B ##uff ##et breakfast can be taken to your room , nice variety of food and drinks . During the week they have a light b ##uff ##et dinner which is very sufficient and free b ##oo ##ze ! ! ! Very central to everything . Couldn ' t fault anything [SEP]
1	[CLS] The suite was very comfortable . The service and front desk were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The location is excellent in walking distance to great restaurants and shopping . I highly recommend this hotel . I would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room 29 ##16 great ve ##i ##w . Bed ##s are very comfortable . But here it comes . A couple of things that I was disappointed with . Super dusty in the room . The hand lot ##ion was used . Then to top it off no water pressure . In ##formed front desk and they could have cared less . The women who name starts with a L . Just keep asking me if I want my bill . I ask if I could use another room so I can be re ##f ##resh ##ed traveling the rest of the day and she was no help . Hope ##ing to share the video here of the water pressure I was dealing with . If not I have 2 p ##ics of the dust and lot ##ion . Thanks s ##wi ##ss ##hot ##el [SEP]
1	[CLS] Business event ( block of forty rooms ) - staff handled all requests in an ex ##ped ##ient , court ##eous manner . We look forward to a repeat strategic planning meeting in Chicago at this location . The 19th Floor is a spectacular setting for an informal reception ; the conference rooms were con ##du ##ci ##ve for several different " set ups " ; and the Board Room an impressive environment to sum ##mar ##ize outcomes of the previous days ' work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Location of the hotel is pretty ok but the hotel is old . It Need ##s renovation . Room ##s are noisy . Running Water makes terrible noise . Hall ##ways are ice cold . The room size was pretty ok but the sofa was not very inviting . Look bit over used [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel was excellent ! The hotel itself is cute and clean and in a great location . The staff was also amazing ! They were friendly from the moment we walked in and they were able to get us a beautiful large corner room on the top floor . They were very helpful with giving us information about not only their on ##site facilities , but also numerous ideas to do in the city . They had a cool text feature with the con ##cier ##ge desk that gave us access to information from the staff whenever we needed it ! We are looking forward to coming back and staying there again next time we are in Chicago ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly would recommend ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Here for a very last minute get ##away and felt so p ##amp ##ered by the staff . A great room for a family of four and really appreciated the birthday treat for my daughter . I liked how quiet the room was and we had space to stretch out a bit with the two room suite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was modern , continental breakfast included . Clean rooms , friendly staff & perfect walking distance to H . O . B . For a concert ! I ' d definitely stay again . W ##if ##i was free , v ##alet parking was around $ 65 but you got in & out privileges with it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While I do recognize that things are different ( v ##alet & room service were closed ) I did expect more from the H ##ya ##tt Regency . Pro ##s : location , view , open bar , lobby is nice , there ’ s a Star ##bu ##cks , open bar Con ##s : self parking and walking through a deserted mall from the parking garage w / little direction , TV not working in room , bed ##ding didn ’ t seem clean , [SEP]
1	[CLS] Malcolm ( front desk ) and Will ( bell ##man ) welcomed us . Their attention to detail and service made our stay comfortable and relaxing . Central ##ly located , ability to walk to numerous stores and restaurants , close to El and many parking lots made this an obvious choice . Make sure to download the parking app to save $ $ on parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel to Chicago on a regular basis and tend to try out different hotels on each trip . Sometimes I go for new trend ##y properties . Other times I check into one of Chicago ' s history rich legacy hotels . The Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is one of the latter . It ' s north end " Gold Coast " location is walking distance to some of Chicago ' s most elegant shopping and fine restaurants . One block off of N . Michigan Ave . ( on Walton ) also delivered a wonderful ##ly quiet room . My room demonstrated some wear and tear , but had very nice features ( such as a waterfall shower ) . Staff is helpful and friendly . Cafe serves a great breakfast . Overall a nice stay . I ' d be happy to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##t was a good stay . the room has enough space for 3 kids and 2 adults , we used a c ##ri ##b for our 3 year old ; excellent breakfast with excellent city view on 26th floor ( if I remember the number right ) , parking is price ##y , but quite standard for downtown Chicago . Close to most attraction . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything went really well . Lauren was great ! Room ##s were nice and the meeting went great . Staff was wonderful an I would definitely recommend this property for the future . Hope to work with you again soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The pack n play delivered to my daughter ‘ s room had stained sheets ! Also the reservation man was functional ##ly ill ##iter ##ate . S ##po ##ke in very poor English yet he was born in Chicago ! Noise in hallway was un ##believable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel it ' s well located . The room was con ##fort ##able and clean . we were in the 33 ##th fl ##or and we have a beautiful view . The staff is kind . At night i enjoyed to have a drink at the bar , there is a great bartender , a nice guy named Ser ##or who knows a lot about wines , when you are traveling it ' s good to have some who can give you good advise ##s about the city and how you can improve your travel . I definitely want to go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were nice , common spaces are beautiful , and the staff is incredibly friendly . Find Leah and tell her hi , she ' s one of the best ! Check out the champagne happy hour from 5 to 6 also . Free unlimited champagne and great company ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been to a number of Hilton properties around the US and this is by far the best . I received exceptional service from two people specifically , Julius Do ##xy and Marvin Car ##ba ##ja ##l . I travel all the time and I received great hospitality here which was really nice and hard to come by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Where do I start ? 1 . Court ##eous staff - very welcoming check in . Was able to check in early . 2 . Del ##iver ##ed a gold ##fish and coffee maker to the room within 20 minutes of arrival . 3 . A ##wes ##ome room - 2 window seats overlooking the river ( one of which was as large as a full size bed ) . 4 . Clean room . 5 . Extra pillows and towels within minutes . 6 . $ 10 mini ##bar credit for signing up with free rewards club . 7 . Best con ##cier ##ge / door ##men ever - they had all of the answers and could get a cab in no time flat ! 8 . Free wine and cheese hour . 9 . Hot and ice ##d coffee selection in the morning . 10 . A ##wes ##ome rates for such a nice place in a great location . I will definitely stay here again . : - ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is beautiful and historic , so worth it in that regard . Ad ##d in that he hop over to the theater was so convenient , especially since it was rain ##ing ! The rooms are nice , with expected age from the era of the hotel . We enjoyed our stay . The v ##alet parking is E ##XT ##RE ##ME ##L ##Y slow , so allow plenty of time . We missed an appointment because we had to wait well over 30 minutes for our car to arrive to the curb . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my third visit to Public and I honestly would not stay anywhere else during my visits to Chicago . We come twice a year and the central location is ideal , the rooms are clean , and the staff is very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If being part of the North Bridge Shop ##s is not important to you - this is the place to stay . Most luxurious in the city in my opinion . Staff can ' t be beat . But location , location , location ! Important to know if you are going to Chicago for a specific event . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent one week at the She ##rato ##n and it was a great week . Nice hotel , great service . Our room on the 27th floor offered a breath ##taking view and it was large and co ##sy . Many options for your breakfast ( it is served at the hotel restaurant but we decided for a simple one at The Link Cafe on the me ##zza ##nine ( yes it ' s Star ##bu ##cks ) . Great dinner ##s at the Chicago Burger Restaurant ! They serve great b ##urger ##s and the best f ##ries I ' ve ever had in my Life . Very helpful con ##sie ##rge - they really helped a lot with the reservations ( bikes , taxi ##s , attractions ) . I did not rate it 5 stars because I had to ask for an extra towel every day ( c ' m on guys it ' s 4 people in a room , why is it always 3 towels ? ? ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel . Service was great , everyone knew their job and took care of business . Well run hotel The location was super . We were there for B ##ike the Drive over Memorial Day . They had a great package deal for this event . Love the Fair ##mont ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Best hotel with exceptional service ! Ronald went above and beyond to make us happy ! Also the chef created a special soup just for me ! Book this one you will be so glad you did . Also it is located right in walking distance to millennium park and Navy pier and so much more walking distance to Hamilton playing at the theater . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came to visit the Fair ##mont for business . I have never stayed here before . Love ##d it . We had a con ##cier ##ge names " Alex " that was always nice and persona ##ble . G ##ave us recommendations for a wonderful Italian dinner that was within walking distance from the hotel . He was always pleasant when he saw us and said hello . Room was wonderful . Love ##d the view at night even though I had a city view and mainly saw other buildings it was a nice change . Air Con ##dition ##er did not seem to be working as room did not cool down at night but it did nothing to hind ##er my visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed on the Gold Floor for a five nights and had a wonderful time . Our room on the 14th floor was spacious . On tour first night we enjoyed a great meal at Columbus Ta ##p . The highlight of the trip was the service and care that we received from the staff in the Gold Lounge . We loved the Honey can ##dies and tea . T ##ip ##hani , Pat ##ric ##io and Man ##dan ##a along with the rest of the staff made this a memorable stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice place ; walking distance to local highlights . Hotel room was clean and cool . T ##idy . Nice . High floor so it was pleasant and very quiet . End of hallway away from elevators and traffic . Old building but nicely kept . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve traveled all over the world and stayed at some of the best hotels . I didn ' t know what to expect when I booked a room at Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Not only was my greeting upon arrival and check - in pleasant and easy , the room was modern , clean and pretty cool ! Bath ##room and fixtures were well done . Strong shower . Order ##ed room service and had one of the best salad ##s of my life ! I admired the pen ##s in the room and upon check ##out asked if I could have a couple . . . the fellow ran out and secured me a few to take with me . Great location and a great stay . I was pleasant ##ly surprised and will recommend Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel to friends and family visiting me in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Buy ##ing - up to Fair ##mont Gold was highly cost - effective since breakfast and lunch was essentially covered . The service was excellent and the staff were very friendly yet professional and very know ##led ##gable . T ##ip for those staying at the hotel : if you are taking a taxi or U ##ber or are using a navigation app make sure to follow directions to the street level entrance on N Columbus Dr , not the lower level entrance from lower W ##hack ##er Dr . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed here overnight with my boyfriend as we had a birthday get ##away with no kids . I never felt more safe in a hotel before , especially for being in the middle of downtown . Amazing views of the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The best part of this hotel is the location . Hotel was recently updated , but it doesn ’ t seem like it ’ s up to brand standard . Floor / main area on lower level is small , con ##ges ##ted and grim ##y . El ##eva ##tors are dirty . Check - in process took forever . Floor in the room wasn ’ t clean . Fu ##rn ##iture in room with stain ##s . Lam ##p and outlets next to bed don ’ t work . Bed was uncomfortable . So disappointed . . . I am loyal to Hilton and this specific property is not up to the standards that I know and expect from Hilton . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very beautiful hotel in a very beautiful location with amazing views . Custom ##er service was amazing ! I wish I remembered the young lady ’ s name at the front desk but I want to personally thank you for making our first experience so amazing . We will be visiting again soon . Thank You Swiss ##ô ##tel Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located in the theater district , this hotel is central ##ly located . With that said , it can be a bit loud , especially since it ' s up against the " L " but not un ##bearable . Where the noise level comes in is the paper thin walls . Super small rooms . Co ##m ##fy double bed . Park ##ing about $ 50 . Walk to the trains , River North restaurants , lake ##front , Garrett ' s pop ##corn and obviously , many theaters . Great fitness center . Great staff . No coffee in the rooms ( really ? ) but stock ##ed mini - f ##rig . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a great location , close to everything . Hotel was spot ##less , as well as our room . Everyone was so pleasant and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The food at 67 ##6 was delicious . Hop ##ing to come back in the fall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service , the staff are very helpful , especially in the bar . Very convenient to walk to the L , we went to a Sox game , very easy to get to south side . Walk to Rose ##bu ##d Prime for dinner , easy walk to Mill ##eni ##um park and Michigan a ##ve . Best for Theater access . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was attending a conference and stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker hotel for 5 nights . It wasn ' t too bad but the hotel is in need of some renovation . The elevators seem very old and make some noise . The room was comfortable , clean and the staff was great but the hotel was average at most . It does feel like your staying at an old casino . If it wasn ' t for the staff I would have rated this hotel less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The experience at the Conrad was top notch . Great location , super clean , the rooms had everything I needed ( and them some , like a travel kit ) , water bottles were p ##lent ##iful and the food on the rooftop was amazing . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our first trip to the wonderful city of Chicago was enhanced by staying in the So ##fit ##el which provided luxury at a reasonable price . Our room was great and the staff couldn ' t have been friend ##lier or more helpful , e ##pit ##omi ##sed by our ma ##rve ##llo ##us con ##cier ##ge , Peter . I would recommend this hotel to anyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a nice quiet hotel in a beautiful and very safe neighborhood ! The lobby and building are lovely and ups ##cale . Bed ##s were comfortable . Everything was very clean . Staff is absolutely amazing and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! I needed a roll away bed and they completely set it up with linen ##s , blankets and pillows while we were at dinner . We used the free bicycles for a couple of hours and rode down the beach ##front path of the lake . Great restaurants and bars surrounded the area too . For $ 120 a night in the Gold ##C ##oast , it was an un ##beat ##able deal if you are looking for accommodation ##s without all the extra amenities . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Crystal Ball ##room with light ##ed dance floor was the perfect setting . Our guests enjoyed the delicious cuisine . And could not wait for the music to begin to break out their best dance moves . The action never stopped ! So much fun ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel for business multiple times per quarter and have always found the H ##ya ##tt my must have in travel . Lots of energy as well as friendly staff and great experience . If a fine dining meal or just a great place to watch the game , there are plenty of choices here . It ' s the only place I stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Home ##wood Suite ##s by Hilton Chicago - Downtown is a great place to stay . It is located by many great restaurants and shopping . Starting at the front door , the staff was great . The rooms were recently re ##mo ##del ##ed and are nicely appointed . Dec ##ent W ##i ##F ##i in the rooms . Free breakfast that was decent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great for single or young couple since it ' s close to bars , clubs , restaurants but quite distance to attractions for families with children . Small rooms but good service , everyone seemed very at ##ten ##tive and supportive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and Room . Breakfast was awesome wide variety . Dinner we had app ##eti ##zers while watching Georgia Football , very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Staff checked in on me daily by text to make sure everything was going well . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Found a reasonable rate here and love the Michigan Avenue location . Ride share doesn ’ t pick up out front is an issue , but can find the close . Hotel is historic , but no reason to not update the rooms . Restaurant staff is amazing and probably the best experience at the hotel was the breakfast staff and food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located on a quiet street but is very close to the local attractions , stores and restaurants . The service from entering the hotel through room service time is excellent . Very clean rooms as well . The gym has everything you would find in a traditional gym and more than a typical hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Price was high but service excellent and location un ##beat ##able . Restaurant was high quality . Tax ##is always available and staff more than willing to help . Easy walk to shopping and Navy Pier . River ##walk enjoyable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Check ##ed in and went to my room to immediately find a fl ##oss ##er on my sofa . So gross makes me want to just check out . Room looks fine otherwise but I still have two more days here . Perhaps off to a rocky start ? If things get better I will re ##vise this review . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the location , to the clean ##liness of the entire facility , to the customer service , to the food , everything was better than I expected . All of the staff was friendly and genuinely helpful . Very nice place to stay in downtown Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for three nights and it cannot be in a better location . Also , the amenities at the hotel are amazing including a great gym , restaurants , and Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel . Our room was spacious and very comfortable . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located just off the river , steps from the magnificent mile and mill ##ennial park this hotel is a great spot to stay . They are located near several restaurants and are also not that far from the theatre district . The B ##I ##g Bar , has a great cocktail selection . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel after attending a concert at the Chicago Theater . Check in was fast and efficient . The room , although small , was great , very clean and had a really great view of the Chicago river . The window had a bench seat with two large pillows , which we sat on to view the river and night scenes . Room service was extremely fast and efficient . All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful . A bit price ##y but a perfect location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great experience during my recent stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l . The staff was very kind and persona ##ble , particularly Solomon . He was extremely helpful and quick to answer my questions . I would definitely stay here again and would recommend to others . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My friend booked this hotel as she arrived a day before me . The property is very easy to get to taking the train from the airport . The property is beautiful , but the service at the Bell Des ##k is slow . The Front Des ##k is very pro ##mpt and fast . The rooms themselves were smaller , but carefully appointed to make sure you have everything you need . Overall , a good experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have visited Chicago for many years now and although the Palmer house is not super updated , I love the staff and the 19th century feel . The staff truly make the experience . The hotel is super close to the train and makes it easy to get to the airport and throughout the city in just block from the train ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful room , great staff ! Love ##ly advice from staff re restaurants and places to visit Got a v ##ou ##cher on travel ##zo ##o which made this affordable whilst being luxurious Room service excellent To ##ile ##tries nice , if I was to return , would use again . A little remote but walk ##able to magnificent mile If using o ha ##re train to centre , I would definitely suggest using blue line to Clark station and then taxi , it is by far the best option in terms of cost , blue line great however lifts don ’ t work on red line [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room very small , no fridge . Very tired room . Ho ##rre ##ndo ##us customer service with staff with di ##s ##g ##run ##tled attitude . This is not a 4 ##star hotel . Location was excellent , close to magnificent mile . Good v ##ibe on entrance but that quickly dim ##ini ##shes . Me and my friend booked twin room and ended up with double . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was very nice . It was clean and the staff was super friendly . The front desk staff , especially Emerson , were friendly and helpful . They truly made me feel like they were happy we were there . The coffee in the morning was a lovely bonus and the wine tasting hour was also fun . We struck up a conversation with another couple and really enjoyed ourselves . The location is great . Chicago has shopping both north and south of the hotel , so it is a nice middle location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent Service and very clean hotel . I would highly recommend this location for business and pleasure . En ##joy ##ed my stay there for the conference and would definitely come back again . Hotel offers many amenities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for a conference which was held here . First off , checking in was a disaster ! I waited 25 min ##s to check in because they had 3 people working the front desk . Once i got to the room , further disappointment . The room was moist and smelled of mold in the bathroom . The walls were paper thin and when the neighbor entered their room , it sounded like they were coming into my room . Check ##ing out was even worse ! Under ##sta ##ffed at the front and i asked a manager if they could bring more staff . There were over 30 people waiting in line and again 3 people handing the front . The manager was rude and walked away while i was still talking ! The worst part we paid over $ 350 a night for this run ##down , mold smelling hole in the wall ! Stay away ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the So ##fit ##el this past week for our anniversary . We had a lovely stay and the staff was very pleasant . O ##b at the front desk was very helpful and persona ##ble ! The room was beautiful and the view over the city was incredible . I highly recommend staying at this hotel whenever you ’ re in the city . The elevator can only be entered by room key which was nice . The hotel was walking distance to everything we wanted . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I highly recommend getting a room with city views , it was S ##O worth the extra money ! The hotel is very charming yet modern and the views were beautiful . The staff was nothing short of amazing . We were in town to celebrate my birthday and it was my boyfriend ##s first time in Chicago . The staff made sure we had a great time and gave us a few extra token ##s for drinks . I will absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone I know traveling to Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our family had an unfortunate experience on my daughter ' s first trip to Chicago . While our mi ##s ##fort ##une had absolutely nothing to do with the hotel , the staff went way above and beyond to help my daughter have a good memory of her first trip to Chicago . We will stay at The O ##m ##ni Hotel on all future trips . Thank you so much . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First of all the hotel is in a really good location . Close to several attractions . However , if you are looking to spend day time in the room ; I would avoid it . The lobby is nice and feels fancy but I found the rooms to be a bit de ##pressing . Perhaps it was the color of the carpet or the lighting but I just couldn ’ t stay in . Maybe you ’ ll like the old v ##ibe of the hotel , I didn ’ t . You can visit the good parts of the hotel without staying in . So I would not recommend this hotel unless they upgrade the amenities in the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Very poor service from a member of staff after there was an issue with my room . When I asked for a solution I was told there was nothing at all that could be done . I then asked if it would be possible to move to a different room later in the day to be given a flat out no . Very bad attitude from g ##rump ##y staff member who needs to find work outside the hospitality industry [SEP]
1	[CLS] High ##ly recommend this hotel for location - rooms - staff - food Amazing hotel situated perfectly off of Ma ##g Mile Staff are friendly Room ##s are fantastic with magnificent views of Chicago Food for breakfast was amazing price ##y but delicious [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was great . not providing year round health insurance for hard ##working hotel staff is not great . The hotel is amazing , not just because of its history , and location , but because the staff work very hard . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful neighborhood and a close walk to high end shopping , restaurants , and the lake . My room was spot ##less and the bed was comfortable . I plan on booking again for my next trip to Chicago ! It was a pleasant experience : ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] Although it was a busy time at the hotel , I was treated as if I was the only guest there . Everyone was very at ##ten ##tive . The room was nice and clean . Order ##ed room service and visited restaurants in the hotel and it was a great experience all around . I will be staying there if ever back in town ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The perfect central location to see different universities in Chicago . Take the train from the airport and out to the universities . Shopping is close and food is of all ethnic ##ities . Would stay again . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter had a conference at the Chicago Hilton and I tag ##ged along . While she was at the conference I visited many of the area parks and sites . I especially enjoyed my private tour of the hotel with Jessica . She went above and beyond . Love ##d the hotel and its amenities . Many sites and restaurants in walking distance . I upgraded to a room with a view of the lake , well worth the extra 40 $ a night . I would stay here again if I ever found myself in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Based on the reputation we expected the rooms to be a bit bigger . The only chair to sit in was the desk chair and the room was cramped . The bathroom in our room was an over - sized p ##edestal . There was no counter space to put you toilet ##ries , hair dry ##er , etc . Very disappointing . I would not recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Walking distance to beach and shops . Big , well equipped suite . Main restaurant well worth a try - excellent food as you would expect from So ##fit ##el . G ##ym was fine and house ##keeping very friendly and efficient - will stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for two nights , needed to work on day 1 , internet very good , desk good too . Staff really helpful . Room ##s first class , good bathroom supplies , extremely comfortable bed . One of the best hotels I have stayed in on a primarily business trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What a great place to stay in Chicago ! A first time visitor I could not have found a better place to stay and when I return the Hotel Monaco will be my first choice . . From the door ##man , to registration , to directions around the city . . . everyone was amazing . The free happy hour was an additional unexpected bonus . My room was a river view and the window seat called to me allowing me to sit , relax and enjoy an amazing view of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For me this is the ultimate hotel for women . Beautiful ##ly decorated ( my bedroom could look like that any day ! ) Great customer service like many Kim ##pton ##s . The restaurant downstairs goes up and down depending on the chef of the moment . It is a great location in Chicago . Easy to walk around the Loop or catch a train or a cab . Millennium Park is nearby for a great Spring or Summer s ##tro ##ll or dinner or concert . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The whole experience was great the people at the front door were amazing and they always opened the door for me the v ##alet always got my car immediately I never had to wait free water at the hotel and the fitness center was great [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed in Chicago recently while my daughter was having a baby . The Talbot ##t never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . The door ##men , Charles and David are always friendly and very helpful getting my bags to my room or putting them in storage . Rosemary is very friendly in house ##keeping and does a very thorough job cleaning the rooms . The entire staff is always concerned with my comfort and stay . The front desk clerk ##s are always polite and provide great service . The bar and restaurant serve wonderful food . I highly recommend staying at The Talbot ##t ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Beautiful hotel and the staff was very professional . The food served at our business event was excellent , and the wait staff was top notch . The only negative was that there was no gift shop in the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love love love . The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel was perfect . Great location . Amazing service . Clean rooms . Gerry is amazing , as well as , everyone who works at Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Can ' t wait to come back to Chicago to stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was beautiful , the food is amazing and their employees were awesome , specially Travis Howard ! he definitely knows how to do his job more than excellent ! I really recommend people to stay there , they also have an amazing location and the rooms are beautiful ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro is located in Chicago ' s theatre district and is literally next door to the Cadillac Theatre . It ' s an old hotel which has been nicely maintained and decorated in Art Dec ##o . Since it is old we expected the room to be small yet there was ample room for a king sized bed which was very comfortable . The bathroom was also very small but had been recently updated and charming . The staff was very friendly and seemed sincere in making your stay enjoyable . I would glad ##ly stay here again and the rate wasn ' t terrible either for being in downtown Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and traveled with my two dogs for their first visit to Chicago . From the moment we pulled up to the moment we departed ; we made to feel extremely welcome . They remembered our names each time we ca ##m in the door and my dogs were very welcomed . We would all stay again in a heart beat . Thank you so much to all of the staff for a wonderful stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a wonderful location and the hotel employees are friendly , helpful and efficient . If not for the v ##alet parking , this would get 5 stars . We have been parking at this hotel ( we are in the office tower ) for the past 3 years without incident . But the past 4 months have been entirely another story . They have lost our keys , din ##ked and scratched the cars , and despite filling out incident reports , nothing has been done . The management of the parking SP + is nothing less than arrogant . Park here at your own risk . There are many parking places in the area as an alternative . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent 3 nights in Chicago and was very happy with the She ##rato ##n Grand . It ' s situated well within walking distance of anything downtown and had magnificent views of the beautiful sky ##line . En ##joy ##ed the pool , and the club lounge absolutely made the stay for us . The wait staff , especially Rene , were extremely friendly . En ##joy ##ed the app ##eti ##zers and breakfast , and as we were in a large group , enjoyed spending the evenings together there watching the Cubs on TV . The bed and pillows were very comfortable . Was disappointed that the bar fridge was totally full with items for purchase and couldn ' t put our own drinks in it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great get ##away wit the wife . Hotel was decent ##ly priced and the staff very welcoming and helpful . The room was very nice and the bathroom was amazing . Wish parking wasn ' t so expensive but it is Chicago [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hotel All ##egro is wonderful . It is in a great location for almost anything you want to do in Chicago . People at the front desk were very friendly . I enjoyed the hotel ' s superb de ##cor . The only negative is that the bathroom is very small , but it really wasn ' t a problem for me . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We took a chance on this hotel at the last minute when we decided to visit our daughter in Chicago at Christmas instead of her traveling home . It was a brilliant idea and we were very pleased . Long ago I had stayed at the hotel at this location , but it has been completely refurbished and has lost its stuff ##iness . Now the furnishings are contemporary , the art is funk ##y and the amenities are stellar . The location is walk ##able to the Ma ##g Mile , but it is tucked away in a quiet ups ##cale neighborhood . All in all , it was a great way to change things up . We hope to return soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I chose to stay in a hotel during the recent cold ( - 22 F / - 30 C ) wave in Chicago . I chose the So ##fit ##el since I had such a great stay during my brother ' s wedding that was at the property over the summer . The staff is fantastic , gorgeous and comfortable lobby , and stunning rooms . Even though I didn ' t have opportunity to take advantage of the neighborhood because it was too cold to venture outside , it is perhaps the best location in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was clean and central ##ly located just 1 1 / 2 blocks from the subway . The staff were friendly and helpful . Breakfast was fresh and filling . Overall it was a great location and really made our vacation a lot of fun . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Too ##k the family to Chicago and stayed 4 days . Suite set up is excellent , kitchen ##ette and supplies were perfect . The breakfast was outstanding , kids loved it . Great location to see the sights . Evening social was a very pleasant surprise . Adults loved that ! Nice pool , small but very good size for kids . Had a great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel which we love great location , wonderful staff a ##r really nice rooms , free breakfast and happy hour . . However when I reviewed my bill there was an extra $ 52 for evening fees . Now I have no idea what these fees include . so I went to the main desk and complained . The fellow at the desk was quite helpful and agreed to remove the fee . . We will continue to stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie when visiting Chicago but will check our bills closely . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is an excellent choice . Location is great , very close to Michigan Avenue but not in the middle of the buzz . We almost did not eat or had breakfast , but the bar and the restaurant were pretty much crowded all the time , so they must be good . Otherwise great service , clean and ample rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed there 18 days and found the room , customer service and the free food to be excellent . Not only was the free food good but they had a staff member in attendance to meet and greet which made the experience even more enjoyable . It is in a great part of the city close to the " Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ' and the free bus to the Navy Pier goes right past . The friend ##liness , helpful ##ness and competence of the staff ranged from great to amazing . Also the city view from our room ( 81 ##3 ) was wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . The hotel is within walking distance of most of the major tourist sites . The elevators are very good . The room was small . The bed was good . The shower was good . The hotel has a Star ##bu ##cks on the street level . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As with all Kim ##pton properties - - and I have stayed at many , in Seattle , Portland , Washington DC , Alexandria VA , Phoenix , and now Chicago - - this hotel R ##OC ##KS . Although it is large for a Kim ##pton ( nearly 500 rooms ) , it has not lost the charm , am ##bie ##nce , and friend ##liness of smaller properties . The Art Dec ##o de ##cor in the lobby is elegant and beautiful , the front desk staff were friendly and helpful , the restaurant served te ##rri ##fic meals ( on the expensive side , but worth it ) , and it ' s in a great location - - blocks from Mill ##eni ##um Park , Macy ' s , Block 57 , the Institute of Arts , etc . What more could one ask for ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in an excellent location , has clean and comfortable rooms and bathroom ##s , and a lovely am ##bie ##nce . However , there is no room service ! So if you are looking for a late night snack or breakfast in bed , this is not the place . The coffee provided in the room is also terrible , with very little cream and sugar available . There is no central heating either , and you have to order a space heat ##er to stay warm . W ##i fi in room was also inconsistent . If you have kids , I would not stay here for the above reasons . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It seems to me there is lack of organization in the staff of the hotel . When I checked in they argued my organization did not sent a credit card authorization . So they took my credit card information to let me check in . I want to believe something was wrong in their system since at the end they charged both my credit card and the one from my organization . Also during the breakfast I was asked more than twice if my breakfast was included in my room rate . I think they should know that information by just checking on my room number . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and a great room , The staff is very friendly and went out of their way to make it a good experience . This was one of the better hotel beds I have slept in . You can ##t beat the location of the hotel , it is close to everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always wanted to stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Hotel because of what I heard and the pictures I saw . We were not disappointed at all . Very historic in that in retains it ' s old look but is modern at the same time . Very clean , and staff were first class all the way . Close to the lake and close to shopping . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Travel ##ed here from Los Angeles to get the full experience of summer ##time Chicago so I wanted something close to downtown . This hotel is perfect location . Q and Sc ##orse ##se helped me out and made sure my stay was absolutely exceptional ! Their customer service was amazing and made me feel right at home . De ##fin ##ite ##ly will be recommend ##ing this hotel ! 5 stars ! - Kat [SEP]
1	[CLS] Kim ##pton hotels are my go to and the All ##egro and their staff are among the best . Came to Chicago with my husband and family for my husband ' s 50th birthday weekend . I had let them know about it ahead of time and the Con ##cier ##ge had a special present waiting for him ! He was beyond pleased and delighted ; ) The con ##cier ##ge also recommended a great restaurant nearby for lunch . And of course the cocktail hour and morning coffee are lovely as well . Thanks to the staff of the All ##egro for a long over ##due and wonderful weekend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pictures were bit misleading . Hotel looked dated & need better cleaning . We had to request toilet ##ries & towels multiple times . Even though we requested , house ##keeping never came during our 4 ##night stay . Great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of my best hotel experiences . Great , clean rooms . Design of rooms is perfect . I enjoyed the tea bags provided in the room greatly . All hotel workers were very friendly and offered a great service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time guests . Love ##ly , charming hotel in a great location for shopping , sight seeing and a walk along Lake Michigan . Room ##s are not large , but the bed was comfortable . Would return again to this little Chicago g ##em . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted from Dec 5th to the 8th . Friendly staff and the rooms were clean with a very comfortable bed . My only complaint would be the in ##cess ##ant pipe rat ##tling in the bathroom that appeared to because the pipes were not secured properly when it was installed . Heard the noise on the second day and just couldn ' t be bothered to pack everything up and move to a different room . Stay away from room 123 ##4 unless you are a deep sleep ##er . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a great location , with access to Michigan Ave . And State St . It ’ s a full service hotel so you don ’ t have to leave if you don ’ t want to . Co ##m ##fort ##able beds and great views of the Chicago River ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was sent from n ##y ##c to work for a week . So blessed to have been booked here . Immediately upon arrival Paulo and the team at the front desk greeted me with kind regards . Would highly suggest any company to book their team to stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] this was a great hotel to stay at if you ’ re traveling alone ! It was quiet , but there were other kind travelers coming in and out of elevators to talk to ! The staff was also very friendly and helpful , and I loved the butler room service : - ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great service , lovely rooms , great lobby bar and great con ##cier ##ge . At ##tended a conference held at hotel . Very convenient for meetings . Would definitely stay here on a return trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I got a spacious room with street view ! ! ! Breakfast was really delicious , especially the eggs . That was one of the best " hotel breakfast meal " I ' ve ever had . Service was good . Porter ##s at the front door , reception ##ist at the counter , waiter ##s at the restaurant , were all court ##eous and helpful . Late check - out is possible . I think most of the the hotel is not full at all . Great location ! It ' s just at the corner of Michigan avenue and Erie Street . Easy to go shopping . They provided free bottle water a lot . No need to drink tap water . G ##ym was good enough . There were towels and bottle water already placed on the running machines . So nice and consider ##ate ! The only draw ##back would be that there was no bath tub in the basic room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was gifted a 2 night stay and was bought th ##ru Group ##on . Group ##on gift was a king bed , however , upon arrival and check in was told King Bed is not a guarantee th ##ru Group ##on . Room assigned was a queen with no view of city just roof tops of surrounding buildings . Staff was friendly . Am ##eni ##ties in room are minimal . El ##eva ##tors are dated and inadequate to service quest ##s . Overall room was clean . . . free w ##if ##i . . . no free bottle ##d water [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel overall with incredibly friendly staff and a co ##zy and comfortable room . Restaurant and bar were both excellent as well . Really wonderful value considering the price . Couldn ' t have been happier and most definitely plan to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my second time staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie and this time it was for my wedding . My family and friends also stayed here and we all could not have been happier with our experience . The staff was extremely friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . From the bell ##men to the house ##keeping staff , everyone made us feel at home and welcomed . I stayed in one of the suites and felt like a king . The windows are nearly floor to ceiling and offer abundant natural light . I also really enjoyed having the bar / lounge as it served as a perfect meeting point for all of our party to gather before heading out each night [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good property but don ’ t expect much with status with fair ##mont club membership as finding the staff to honor things like early or late check out is not as promised or guaranteed like they ad ##vert ##ise as a platinum member . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this hotel through Price ##line . When we got into our rooms , the heat was stuck on so we slept with the windows open all night both nights we were there . The bathroom door was a heavy pocket door that was extremely difficult to get shut . It didn ##t even shut all the way . . . . very annoying . They hotel itself was out ##dated and needed an upgrade . I can live with that stuff but after we get home I find out that they charged me for parking that cost just as much as the room for 2 nights ! Never again will I stay at this place or recommend that anyone stays here . There are much nice ##r hotels for $ 20 more a night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ’ t speak highly enough about this property . For the price , the location was ideal . Every staff member that I encountered went above and beyond expectations . The room was quite , large especially for a big city . And , it was clean . I will definitely stay here next time . There was an elevator down but it was never a problem . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I really enjoyed my stay in H ##ya ##tt Regency Hotel . Some of my reasons are : Perfect location in downtown Chicago ; Great customer service ; Easy check - in and check - out ; Clean rooms and wonderful b ##uff ##et in the lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location and nice suite rooms . Friendly staff all the way across . Breakfast leaves a bit to be desired - is that plain sort of Hampton Inn fare that wears . Location is great - across from the CT ##A Red Line and pro ##ximal to great restaurants , shopping , and downtown offices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Swiss ##ote ##l is central ##ly located 3 . 5 blocks away from millennium park - 4 . 5 blocks away from Navy Pier - across the street from the Chicago river walk and 4 . 5 blocks away from G ##eor ##dan ##os deep dish pizza . I walked everywhere ! The staff — L ##yne ##tte , by far , is one of the nice ##st and thoughtful hotel representatives I ’ ve ever encountered . Anything I needed , she found a quick solution for . The room was a nice size and clean . The tub was big enough for me to fit in it and I ’ m 6 ’ 4 ” . My room was on floor 34 overlooking the River walk . Overall I had low expectations for Chicago but Swiss ##ote ##l impressed me - it ’ s an outstanding place to visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a classic , Art Dec ##o hotel which has been modern ##ized just enough . The elevators are a bit slow and rooms a bit small but a really lovely hotel and great location away from the tourist area . Central ##ly located to the theater district . I was not impressed with the hotel restaurant but it was packed so could have been just my meal . The champagne at happy hour is a nice touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a wonderful hotel . The location is te ##rri ##fic . Close to State street shopping and Michigan Avenue . Lots of great dining and things to do . The Ki ##nz ##ie staff is great . So very friendly from every member . Check in was quick and express check out could not have been easier . The room was very clean and a very nice size . The Ki ##nz ##ie also features and breakfast spread on each floor which was very convenient and a wonderful bar with complementary snack ##s and a couple free drinks . This was our second stay and I know we will return to the Ki ##nz ##ie . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have stayed at Ki ##nz ##ie many times over recent years . Always clean and quiet . Cool v ##ibe but not pre ##ten ##ti ##ous . Location is great . Higher rooms on Ki ##nz ##ie Street are best . Quick check - in . Can din ##e easily with many options within 2 - 3 blocks . Lo ##bby is small and not for gatherings . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had an incredible view at the Swiss ##ote ##l ! The staff were 100 % court ##eous and helpful at every encounter . Great location in Chicago and you can easily see the night ##ly fire works display at the Navy Pier . I made a huge Bo ##o Bo ##o and for forgot to empty my safe when I checked out . I left a bunch of valuable ##s and cash in the safe . I realized my error while boarding a flight at O ' Hare . I called Mr John Goodman , The Director of Risk Management of the Swiss ##ote ##l . He im ##media ##tley secured my items a UP ##S ' d them to me pro ##nto . In ##te ##g ##rity like this is hard to find in our rushed world we live in . Thanks John ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel with lovely public spaces but the rooms need up ##dating - carpet dirty , small baths shower drain didn ' t work . Location is great , quiet ##er than Michigan Ave but walk ##able to shopping and Lincoln Park [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super quiet stay . Run very efficiently . Excellent v ##alet and front desk service . Great location with easy walking distance to river / theater / delicious food / shopping / navy pier and many more perfect Chicago - favorites . [SEP]
1	[CLS] W ##E stayed at the Fair ##mont Millennium Park , Friendly and court ##eous staff , the room was clean and t ##idy , check in and check out very quick . We stayed in the Gold club section of the hotel as we usually do when we stay at a Fair ##mont . In comparison to other Fair ##mont hotels we found the Breakfast and cocktail hour was lacking in choices and quality - temperature of food was not as good as what we had had in the past . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After 25 years of living in Chicago , I spent most of the first half of 2017 living out of the Public which was a truly memorable experience - the entire staff from the front desk to coffee bar in the morning and bar staff at night made me feel at home - and I was sorry to have to move on when i moved to a new apartment . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Whenever we visit Chicago , we always stay at the O ##m ##ni . This was a double - kid birthday celebration weekend . Having mentioned this to the con ##cier ##ge prior to arrival , we were pleasant ##ly surprised to receive some t ##ira ##mis ##u and sparkling wine in our room . . . much appreciated ! The location is perfect and the accommodation ##s are great . I recommend a corner room suite upgrade with much better views than the standard rooms . With regard to the breakfast , the food is great and there is an ample selection of choices . The wait staff is also very friendly and professional . The pool was jam packed with kids at peak hours . My kids loved all the chaos . . . not sure this would appeal much to a romantic couple ? We enjoyed our stay very much and will certainly return again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ing on a road trip we stopped in Chicago and stayed a night at the Fair ##mont . Great rates and the gold rooms are worth the extra charge . The gold lounge was great and had wonderful views of the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s been my 2nd time at this hotel and because of the fireworks that are done right in front of the lobby and on the river , amazing experience . The staff and security person ##el on New Years is amazing . The hotel offers ch ##an ##pa ##gne toast , good ##y bags ( $ 10 ) with New Ye ##war ##s mask , pop ##pers , etc ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed at the Talbot ##t a number of times and always find it pleasant . We like the location and the feel of the place . One actually feels like a guest , rather than a customer . We look forward to returning the next time we visit the greatest city in the world . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Absolutely enjoyed our stay here . Great and superb ##ly convenient location . 10 minutes Walking distance to 360 ##C ##hic ##ago , 30 minutes to Millennium Park , She ##dd A ##qua ##rium and Willis Tower .

Free hot breakfast b ##uff ##et , free dinner b ##uff ##et complete with red / white wine and beer . . . ! ! ! ! Super ##b room , clean spacious and great city view . . . Surely want to visit Chicago again mainly be ##co ##z of this f ##abulous and wonderful hotel . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first time staying at the Conrad Hotel . We spent a week in downtown Chicago . It was an awesome location . Lots of shopping and restaurants around the neighborhood . It was walking to distance to everything . Very safe location . I was there with myself ( a woman ) and my three daughters so safety is always very important to me . The employees were great . They were friendly and very helpful . They went out of there way to make our stay comfortable . The room was new , very beautiful and comfortable . I was surprised how spacious it was for a downtown hotel room . The beds were comfortable and we also had a nice couch to sit on by the window . I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend it . This was my first time at a Conrad Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hotel is beautiful . The bed was so comfortable , best night sleep I ' ve had in a hotel in a long time . The bathroom was huge . It ' s close by to a lot of restaurants and shopping . My only complaint is the carpet ##s , they need to be changed out in the lobby and elevators . I would highly recommend and I would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel had many more positive ##s than negative ##s . Bed ##s were soft , rooms were spacious . location was great , as was the wine reception and continental breakfast . The draw ##backs , noisy , the soap ##s , coffee ##s and towels were not re ##fill ##ed properly and v ##alet staff was at ##ten ##tive but super slow . All ##ow time if you need your car retrieved . All in All a good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location close to most major attractions , clean , reasonable price . Restaurant only average and over ##p ##rice ##d . I wish the upgrade I had requested for an additional $ 45 per night had worked out . Still not sure what happened with that . I would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After a long confinement to take care of my parents , we came to this large and beautiful hotel , we were very well received especially by Stefano who helped us so much to make this stay magnificent , we slept in a spacious room with lots of technological equipment , beautiful functional bathroom , incredible breakfast [SEP]
1	[CLS] 1st time staying at a Home ##wood Suite ##s and this location of Grand and W ##aba ##sh is perfect . Close to a lot of activities and U ##ber ' s were very reasonable . Michigan Avenue was 2 blocks away . Lots of great restaurants within blocks . Beach within walking distance . Big ##ger rooms were nice to just sit in and relax . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service , com ##fy bed , lovely room . We couldn ’ t have asked for a better place to stay in Chicago . The hotel is on the Miracle Mile surrounded by top notch restaurants and shopping The staff was very at ##ten ##tive and eager to please . We ’ ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There are hotels in Chicago that make the grade . The K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker makes the grade , but not by much . It is dated and seems a ta ##d ch ##ic - s ##hab ##by . However , given a good price , this place can be a good deal for travelers to Michigan Avenue . S ##light ##ly away from the action . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything good - Nothing negative Great location ( right downtown ) Friendly staff ! Most comfortable bed [UNK] and super nice bathroom with nice van ##ity - room to spread your things out - good security too ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My wife and I stayed for a 20th wedding anniversary and this hotel did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . It ’ s convenient ##ly located and within walking distance of the magnificent mile , Mill ##eni ##um Park , the Chicago river walk , and the theater district . Our room was spacious and very comfortable . The amenities are top notch and the service was excellent . I highly recommend the All ##egro ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pleasant ##ly surprised by this hotel . While it is older and doesn ' t have every am ##eni ##ty that others do , it was a great value that delivered exactly what was needed . Very little interaction with hotel staff , but the hotel is clean , well maintained and has a location that can ' t be beat . Shock ##ed by how nice the bathroom / shower comb ##o was . Great set - up . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I want to let you know that you will have to pray extra for breakfast and internet . . . . which was a new experience for me when you pay so much money and expect to get at least internet as standard . I would suggest you go and stay somewhere else . . . I don ##t like the feeling of having to pay for breakfast or waking up and go hunting for breakfast every day of my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was full of great customer service and a smooth sense of style . We stayed there because it was near the Private Bank Theater , but we also found the hotel in walking distance to Mill ##eni ##um Park , the She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , and Navy Pier . The window seats are a super - cute treat , but the free wine hour was the cherry on top ! I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just a great bout ##ique style hotel . Price ##s are reasonable , service is always excellent . Staff is always a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the location is central to the theater district as well as many other must - do Chicago activities . A t ##ure g ##em ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everyone at the Ki ##nz ##ie from the moment of arrival the to final departure were fantastic . Just to name a few of the Jerry , Alex , Cole and especially George and Martin made for a very memorable stay ! This will be our go to hotel when we stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay at O ##m ##ni Chicago ! It is located perfectly on Miracle Mile for tons of city fun ! The door ##men , con ##cier ##ge , and staff were stellar ! We loved the cheese tray left by the welcoming staff to celebrate our 50th stay at an O ##m ##ni property ! Our room was just spectacular ! We did the corner room with the private bedroom and lounge area . . . lovely ! This hotel is amazing ! We love the O ##m ##ni brand and this one is near the top for us ! The de ##cor is sleek and modern , and it just feels amazing to be there ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful , the rooms are comfortable and quiet , and the staff is great . If you are a runner like me , you will love the location near the Lake ##front where you can run forever . Also the fitness room / health club is awesome , one of the best hotel fitness rooms I ' ve ever seen . There are all types of machine weights , bar ##bell ##s , t ##read ##mill ##s , machines , an indoor running or walking track , hot tub , pool and sa ##una . Really fantastic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for just one night , check in was an easy process . Very beautiful when you walk in , love the old feel and was beautifully decorated for Christmas . Hotel is very convenient if you want to walk around the city . Very close to the John Hancock building , and backs up to the Louis V ##uit ##ton store . I had a king bed room , the room was a little small but most city hotels are , my family had a two queen bed room and it was much more spacious . My only complaint about my stay would be the sheets , they were very thin and paper like and even made c ##runch ##y sounds . All in all a good stay though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at The Ki ##nz ##ie for a recent business trip and loved it . The little touches of continental breakfast on each floor , a cocktail and app ##eti ##zer reception and the amenities in the room were wonderful . The location is fantastic also . I will be back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love stay at this hotel ! I have never had any issues with checking in or my stay ! Everyone is pleasant ant the rooms are big and the view is great . The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of the great restaurants and bars . We ' ve had room service bring us breakfast which was very nice also . I would definitely recommend the So ##fit ##el without any hesitation ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I tried booking a two - day meeting for 15 people . I received an initial response from sales and then nothing . . . they went dark . I tried to contact them , but nothing . Very strange . I ended up at Hilton Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love this place ! ! ! ! Service is consistently above & beyond . The hotel is warm and inviting for the entire family . We ’ ve been staying here for at least 6 years . Located close to Michigan Avenue and the Lake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice stay in a clean suite , giving us relaxing accommodation ##s after a long day of touring . Love ##d the location . Near Michigan Avenue and it was easy to walk to many of the restaurants and stores we wanted to discover . Very close to the red line ( one block ) for easy access to W ##rig ##ley Field . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my 3rd year in a row staying here and this hotel never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . I upgraded to a lake view and it was well worth it ! I would recommend checking the NFL schedule before arriving as there could be a lot of fans there on home weekends ( Soldier ' s Field is a short walk ) . However , even with the fans , everything was great . One small grip ##e - I didn ' t get any water bottles on my stay . But I obviously lived to tell about it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Simple put it ’ s a beautiful hotel . The rooms are a ta ##d out of date but clean . It is a historic building so as you can imagine there are signs here and there of age . The athletic club is vast and offers just about every am ##eni ##ty you would need . Room service is time ##ly . And the location is straight across from grants part and walking distance to just about anything . I would echo customer service can be hit or miss as many other reviews also state . Overall a great hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel makes a super first impression with a modern foyer and s ##ty ##lish bar ( though not sure about the staff greeting in French ) . The rooms are massive and benefit from good W ##i ##F ##i , comfortable bed and a desk but frankly speaking the room was very dated , something of a ma ##gnolia over ##load straight out of the 90 ’ s a theme carried down to the Bose sound system and bathroom telephone . My room also had a lot of noise due to some work being undertaken close by in the hotel and house ##keeping thought 08 ##45 seemed a normal time to do their turn ##down ##s . It would be super if the rooms matched the same level of modern ##ity as the foyer and bar . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying at the Intercontinental . First let me say the staff at this property are truly amazing . The most friendly and genuine people I have ever met while Travel ##ing . Malcolm Moore at the front desk in guest service was so ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . Will the door ##man / bell ##man was truly re ##f ##reshing . The pool was ma ##je ##stic and the room and view were exquisite . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was located perfectly for everything to do downtown . Right on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for shopping , walking distance to Mill ##eni ##um Park , and close to the Chicago River as well . We would most definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##rri ##ved late at night and got to room to discover yet again a hotel room devoid of drinking water ( either free or to pay for ) . Please guys , in this day and age , have drinking water in the rooms . As a Hilton honors I get really fed up with the way Hilton does different things in different hotels ! To add insult to injury when I made this suggestion politely the next morning I was greeted with , " do you want your bill email ##ed to you ? " and my issue was completely ignored . Who is training the reception staff ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] I received a free room upgrade to the 16th floor which had an amazing view . Thank you to the staff for making my stay most plea ##su ##rable ! This is where I will choose to stay whenever I ' m in the Chicago area . Thank you Hilton ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a great weekend and the All ##ege ##o was a big part of it . Great service all around . Location location location ! I will stay there again . It ’ s an easy walk from there to all the great stuff in the North Loop . Best place I ’ ve stayed downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The good : We loved the location and the modern decoration . The rooms were clean , big and comfortable . Very professional and helpful staff . The bad : Several months in advanced I requested adjoining rooms , on a high floor with a view ; but didn ' t get any . We arrived at noon , and the rooms were only ready around 4 PM . The worst : The hotel charge to receive packages , despite their size and quantities . I wanted to receive a small product that I bought online , and they charged me more than the cost of the product , just to receive it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed a 2 night weekend stay on the 7th floor . Really comfortable bed . Room amenities very good for this standard of hotel . En ##joy ##ed wine hour and free coffee . Two very slow elevators . 7 / 11 shop directly across the road . Walking distance to plenty of restaurants and bars . Would stay here again when back in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location is perfect . Hotel is Love ##ly , lots of the old charm of the Ambassador East . Great value Look forward to the restaurant re ##ope ##ning . Staff tries very hard to meet guests needs . Door ##men are superior ! [SEP]
