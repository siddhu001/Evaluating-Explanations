1	[CLS] Wonderful location , lovely hotel , great service . Hotel is central ##ly located , two minutes walk to the Ma ##gni ##fi ##sent Mile and all the shops and restaurants . Restaurant in the hotel also is great and very at ##ten ##tive staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay for one night before travelling home . Book ##ed a one bedroom suite , very spacious living room with a very comfortable sofa bed and an additional bed placed in the walk in wardrobe ( yes it was that big ! ) . Good location off the beaten track in quiet part of town with easy access to the major food spots in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is full of charm , warmth and character . Not a standard cookie cutter chain hotel . I visited during the polar v ##ortex with - 20 degree temperatures . I was very concerned when I arrived in Chicago and nearly the whole city was shut down . The hotel was up and running like it was any other day . The only disruption was temporary closure of a few shops and cafe ##s , but the main restaurant remained open . No shortage of food , service or hospitality . Overall , wonderful visit ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location for sights ##ee ##ing and exploring . Help ##ful staff , was able to check in early . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed plus quiet room made for great sleeping . Second time staying here and plan to return on my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I visited Downtown Chicago for 1 night on business and this Home ##wood Suite ##s was amazing . It was just re ##mo ##del ##ed in the Spring and it was so fantastic ! I would highly recommend this to couples , business travelers and even families ! They have a night ##ly heavy app ##eti ##zers and also free breakfast in the morning . Everyone was super pleasant and it was a very nice trip . Be ##ware . . . it is Chicago and their Vale ##t parking was 59 dollars a day . . . . O ##uch ! But it does let you come and go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a convention . Many complaints , including : hard sell for upgrade at check ##in , didn ' t have type of room that i had reserved unless upgraded , no place in the room to store personal drinks . But the big one was the de ##ceptive pricing practices on the mini ##bar , where they charged an additional 33 % mark ##up over the already in ##f ##lated prices to cover " g ##rat ##uity " , with no not ##ification on the mini ##bar menu that this would be added . They said it was " in the fine print " . Me never going back to this hotel is " in the fine print " of this review . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It appears like they never vacuum or clean the carpet ##s in the hallway ##s and rooms . I left a few pieces of torn paper on the carpet before I left in the morning and they were still there when I came back late at night . Never staying at this hotel ever again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A great hotel , great location , and great staff . High ##ly recommend . Came for business , left having a lot of fun too . Staff was efficient and friendly . One of the best hotels I have stayed at in a long time , and I travel a lot . My check in and out dates were incorrect due to my work colleague , but they accommodate ##d my change even though they were sold out . Right across the street from the River walk , which I enjoyed every night . A truly wonderful experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome Hotel ! ! Clean , near all attractions , and A ##wes ##ome services ! Te ##rik B . Is an awesome employee . He went above and beyond to help us with anything we had questions about . Great attitude and always has smile on his face . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed four nights at the Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco Chicago . This hotel is central ##ly located , near the River ##walk and a short walk from The Art Institute . Although it seems like most of the rooms have window seats , we recommend to request a room with a window seat that over ##look ##s the Chicago River . The staff members were court ##eous and helpful . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We can ' t say enough great things about our experience at O ##m ##ni Chicago on Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . All hotel staff were friendly and helpful . When we had questions , we got answers that turned out to be very good . I ' d stay at this hotel again and again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great time in the Wind ##y City ! The only thing we noticed was that our room was dusty when we arrived . We informed hotel staff and they were very re ##sp ##ons ##ive . However , we noticed a few days into our stay that the room was dusty again . We can only attribute it to the age of the hotel . My wife has all ##er ##gies but the dust was not bad enough to cause her any problems . This was a minor problem and was far out ##wei ##gh ##ed by all the positive things we can say . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful , s ##ty ##lish hotel and very comfortable room . Help ##ful , professional staff . Great location within walking distance of much of downtown Chicago . Very nice rooftop bar with views of downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Millennium Park , Pier Navy , Boat Tour with Dinner , the restaurants ( all of them offer nice gas ##tron ##omi ##c experience ) and the H ##ya ##tt Regency . The weather was fantastic , so we have opportunity to walk around and see the amazing Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is easily accessible — right on the river . The sunrise ##s that we saw were beautiful . The staff have always been so helpful and very friendly . I would recommend this hotel for any event you were attending in Chicago . The hotel room was very quiet . We were never awakened by noises from other rooms . You can easily walk to Michigan Avenue where all of the great shopping is from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile : Great location , iconic building , within walking distance to the best shopping area close to the water tower . Walk down the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile towards the river front . Not to be missed : tours organized by the Chicago Architecture Center located by the river front . Their boat tour is a must ! The Architecture center offers several tours related the iconic Chicago architecture . Also not to be missed : the tour to visit Frank Lloyd Wright ’ s house and ate ##lier in Oak Park . The CA ##C guides are highly qualified individuals , and convey the very best outlook on Chicago ’ s precious Art and Architecture treasures . Chicago Architecture Center 111 East W ##ack ##er Drive at Michigan Ave . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When I come to Chicago I usually stay at four seasons . This trip I wanted to try something different and my con ##cier ##ge at American Express told me about the So ##fit ##el . I eagerly except ##ed and was blown away at the beautiful room ( suite ) plus the accommodation ##s they would and did go out of there way for . I needed a refrigerator , they delivered , the sofa made up with wonderful down bed ##ding , they delivered ! ! Wonderful experience ! Oh plus there was a celebrity staying who was humble enough to sign auto ##graphs for my kids : ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wow ! Beautiful hotel outstanding service and great views . Stay ##ed here as part of our anniversary trip and we were truly impressed beyond expectations . Diana ##a at the front desk greeted warmly and took care to engage us . Eric on the guest warm was very helpful and a nice card and treat from Taylor capped off a fantastic stay . High ##ly recommend for a romantic visit or if you just need a great place to anchor your Chicago visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Hilton Chicago for the auto show in town . Bus 3 took me right to the convention center . Breakfast package with the room was great . Nice coffee shop in hotel . Great fitness and pool area . Room ##s with 2 bathroom ##s convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place was great ! ! ! The staff was so friendly , and helpful I felt like I was staying at the Four Seasons Hotel . The Lo ##bby lounge was wonderful with a great menu and wine list . The hotel and rooms were clean and fully stock ##ed with all we needed . The hotel lend ##s itself to old - world charm , in its fixtures and furnishings . Our Con ##cier ##ge Gene was FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C really nice and very helpful . He got us last minute tickets to a show and we were so app ##re ##cia ##tive . I forget the name of the door man , he was tall and mature with the best smile and helpful attitude . Thank you all ! ! ! We will be back ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved my stay at the So ##fit ##el . From the moment you walked through the doors you could tell you were somewhere special . The rooms were the perfect size , very clean , and the beds were very comfortable . I didn ' t spend too much time in my room as I was there for a work Christmas party , but in my future travels to Chicago I would definitely book another room at the So ##fit ##el . Everyone speaking with their f ##rench accent ##s is a wonderful bonus and makes you feel like you have stepped into France for a night or two . Great job So ##fit ##el ! ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] As always , our stay at the H ##ya ##tt Regency for our Arthur Murray Dance Show ##case was an excellent experience from beginning to end . We do this every year and hope to continue in the future . Everything was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a place that is a central location to stay when in Downtown Chicago . Stay in the hotel for some fine dining or go to Navy Pier for the great views of the lake ##front . The hotel has history , from the good old days of celebrities and mob ##sters dining together to the filming of " The Fu ##git ##ive " movie starring Harrison Ford . No doubt you will be writing a good review as I have , its a great central ##ly located landmark . [SEP]
1	[CLS] used points to get two nights at hotel . very nice location large room . nice bar large bathroom . got upgraded to executive tower and two free drinks . mi ##cha ##el j ##ord ##an rest ##era ##unt over ##p ##rice ##d so we ate elsewhere [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was great and super re ##sp ##ons ##ive to our needs ; food was average . F ##ac ##ilities need some work . Jack ##hammer ##ing on the street woke us up first morning and we were on 15th floor ! ! Real ##ize they just reopened but could do better . I would give them another try if I had business at Willis Tower again [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel personnel was on strike when we were there , so most of the bars and restaurants were closed and there was a pick ##et line at the front entrance . That being said we had a delight ##ful stay ( 6 nights ) and liked the room we had and the location of the hotel a lot . Of particular notice was a slide show in the elevators with t ##ri ##via questions about the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying at this hotel ~ in town with another couple for a long concert weekend . We both booked the Junior suite ~ their bed was on a standing bed frame while ours was on the floor ( Murphy bed ) . The room was reasonably priced , clean & nicely decorated / updated . This hotel is close to lots of shopping & restaurants but not directly in all the chaos downtown . We enjoyed the hotel restaurant several times ~ our favorite staff member was Julia . Check in / out was quick en ##ou ##gg . We would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived at 10 : 30 ##am and asked for a 10 : 30 ##am check - in . Although 3 : 00 ##pm is the standard check - in time they made it happen to have our room available at 10 : 30 ##am ! ! We had a lovely breakfast at the hotel and then dropped our bags and had a fantastic Day ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was comfortable with a beautiful view of the lake . The room was clean and the beds comfortable . The $ 20 per night resort fee seemed a bit ridiculous considering all it gets you is W ##i ##F ##i , a smooth ##ie ( which really was just yo ##gu ##rt ) , fitness equipment delivered to your room , and free dry cleaning , most of which the majority of guests won ’ t use or would expect to receive anyway ( like the W ##i ##F ##i ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service was not good . Ra ##n out of food at the evening reception . Did not stock premium upgraded items . I had to call and ask for our room premium upgrades and to have our room cleaned . S ##lop ##py job cleaning our room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel had a lot going for it at a fair price . A downtown location which included breakfast and indoor pool made it a logical choice for our family of four . Faculty was well maintained and all the staff we met were friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I made a last minute reservation as I entered into the city and it started rain ##ing . I was greeted as if I was the only person checking in that afternoon . I had pro ##mpt and pleasant service . My room was clean , pleasant and large . The bathroom was fantastic ! I certainly will stay here again and am look ##i ##jn ##g forward to it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at a p ##let ##hora of hotels in the city . Ambassador , is our now , number 1 ! The service , the atmosphere , and the hospitality was above and beyond what we could have asked for . We were immediately greeted by the manager , Travis . He not only made us comfortable but went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect . I immediately felt like a welcomed guest instead of a number . # top ##not ##ch [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a single night in Chicago but this hotel made a wonderful impression and can ' t imagine I would stay elsewhere . Room ##s are spacious and comfortable , staff is friendly and a ##cco ##mo ##dating and location is perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel with f ##ab views of Grant Park . If you can upgrade to a Sign ##ature 1 bedroom suite , it is very spacious . Very clean hotel and central ##ly located for most of the major attractions . Super comfortable beds and the bathroom ##s are nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] S ##pent a weekend with my wife and I feel lucky I stumbled into a deal to stay at the O ##m ##ni . Nice ##ly appointed all - suite rooms , ours wasn ' t huge but plenty big enough . Good bed , great shower , and all of the high end amenities that I expect in an O ##m ##ni . Fantastic location , within walking distance to the CT ##A and many restaurants in walking distance , even many not on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Very nice bar with good wine and beer choices . Dec ##ent work out area and it has a pool and hot tub indoor ##s . The internet is only free in the lobby and restaurant . If you can get a decent price , I would definitely stay here again . The only other thing is that the walls are thin and the outside traffic noise is pretty significant . Bring ##ing ear plug ##s may be a good idea . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Do not go there ! Walls are thin , you can hear people and they can hear you over normal conversations . They never gave me the room I booked and they wanted to charge me more , you have to review your bill carefully not for them charge more ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The pool was beautiful . It was great to have a Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby . The room was nice and bed was comfortable . It would be nice to have a fridge for personal use , not just mini bar . All was good , but check in took way too long . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was in Chicago for business and decided to stay at The Ki ##nz ##ie because of the location . Bed ##s were com ##fy and staff was te ##rri ##fic . It was an easy walk to Cloud ##G ##ate and other attractions as well . I would highly recommend Ki ##nz ##ie for business or pleasure ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] What a f ##abulous ##ly awesome stay at the Hilton Chicago ! The ladies and gentlemen from the “ front door to the back door ” are outstanding . They are very professional and are as ##tu ##te at anti ##ci ##pating the needs of their guests . I have had a fl ##aw ##less experience and will stay at the hotel whenever I am in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] for the money paid here ~ 450 USD / D ##A ##Y ! ! , this is a terrible 5 stars . the offered services and the quality of the rooms are just o ##bs ##cene . they forget to deliver the laundry every single time , the b ##fast is a la cart only and the fruit they serve is not far from being made of plastic . the room keeper ##s slam the doors at any time of the day and night . the fridge is broken . The day i arrived i found brownish marks on the towels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Service - from the check in staff , the the service at the front bar / restaurant , to the person cleaning the rooms - very disappointing . Sad ##ly there were a few employees that were helpful , and I understand it was during the Chicago Marathon , but still no excuse to be rude . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel staff was incredibly amazing . They went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect . This was the wedding hotel for our daughter ' s wedding . The pictures from the Ava balcony were breath ##taking . The suites for the bride ##sma ##ids and groom ##sm ##en to get ready in were stunning . Thank you Public Hotel for making our daughter ' s wedding weekend f ##abulous . We are truly grateful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In the heart of the city walking distance to many sites . F ##abulous views , clean rooms and excellent staff . I wish I could have stayed a few more days . If you have an upcoming stay in Chicago I highly recommend the Hilton [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a full day at Lo ##lla ##pal ##oo ##za . The room was ready early and was very clean . The room I checked in to online was the one we stayed in . This is not always the case . Overall it was very quiet and breakfast was wonderful . I paid for the upgrade and Gustavo was the best o ##mel ##ette chef I have ever had at a hilt ##on property . Great food selection and all fresh . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved it . The room was spacious , clean and comfortable . View from 30th floor just beautiful . Staff helpful and friendly . Walking distance to Navy Pier , shopping and restaurants . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved our stay at the Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro in Chicago . Great location and close to Millennium Park , shopping and restaurants . The staff was friendly and greeted us with a smile . Room was clean and the King bed was very comfortable . Room was well stock ##ed with waters , snack ##s and had a mini refrigerator . The lobby bar was vibrant and the restaurant had a great breakfast menu . This was one of our favorite bout ##ique hotels . Will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price we paid , this was so not worth it . Yes the lobby is gorgeous , but the check in line was so ##o long , ( over 20 minutes ) the rooms were dark , did not feel clean , carpet looked un ##va ##cc ##ume ##d , and just felt din ##gy . I got a terrible all ##ergic reaction , I believe it was their sheets and spent 2 days with an uncomfortable contact der ##mat ##itis . Bath ##rooms were out ##dated and small . I had to check out and instead stayed at the She ##rato ##n , which was beautiful clean , and my r ##ash sub ##sided . They did offer a different room , but when I saw it it was just as din ##gy feeling and you could hear the elevators w ##hir ##ring up and down constantly . Not what you ’ d expect for over $ 300 a night . I would definitely pass on this one . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel as part of a group ( Giants season ticket members ) and we were treated royal ##ly . It is an all - suite hotel , and the rooms were fantastic - nice seating area , king size bed , and large screen TV . Each morning , we had a wonderful b ##uff ##et breakfast , and not the usual continental , but home ##made bread ##s and sa ##usage ##s , bacon , different types of fresh fruit , and eggs cooked to order . It was a wonderful start to our day [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Place ! Always enjoy staying there ! Central ##ly located and close to Michigan Ave . The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are clean . The outside area in ##front of the hotel is very nice to sit and have a drink and something to eat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for a conference at the Hilton and it was a perfect location for us since the conference was held at the hotel . Our room was nice and clean and the hotel itself is beautiful . The ballroom and the great hall are gorgeous ! The location overall is not my favorite for exploring Chicago if you are visiting from out of town . It is a little south from a lot of the activities that people like to visit and since it is not in the central part of the activity , the streets are not very populated at night to walk around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is our 4th time staying at this hotel . This time we had a beautiful suite 270 ##1 . Worth every penny . Hu ##ge room , beautiful views . Access to the Gold Lounge . Cody Cook , the manager , and his staff could not have been more at ##ten ##tive to our needs . We look forward to our next visit here and staying at this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place gets everything right . Lots of outlets and lights , easy to use room , s ##ty ##lish without being annoying . And the location is perfect : short walk to lake , plenty of eating options , and a very walk ##able neighborhood . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I stayed here over Thanksgiving , and it was wonderful . Not only was the whole hotel beautifully decorated for the holidays but it was clean and the staff was always available when you needed help . With three women staying in one room the best per ##k was our room had T ##W ##O BA ##TH ##RO ##OM ##S . Yes , you read that right two full bathroom ##s for two queen bedrooms . It made getting ready for dinner and the day so easy and stress - free . The bar was quick and ta ##sty if you need a quick bite or just want to sit and enjoy your evenings . Overall , a wonderful holiday stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect spot to h ##unk ##er down when attending medical appointments at Northwestern University just a few blocks away . Always a great experience . Don ' t have to worry about a thing from the time you turn your vehicle over to the v ##alet , checking in , having a great room , good breakfast and social hour . An A + for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the hotel is decent but unfortunately this is all compliment I can give . The room is very small , there is no view from my room , To my surprise , there is no room service at all . The internet in the room is not free and extremely slow . Do not go to the breakfast . It ' s basically a continental breakfast but charges $ 24 per person . For the price of the hotel and its star level , I would expect a lot more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful room with a great view of the river . The staff was amazing , especially the Door ##man Michael . He ' s from Ireland and knows all the good places in town . He even saw us at an Irish bar one evening and stopped to chat with us . I would glad ##ly stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent Labor Day weekend here . Great central location for visitors . We walked to the Navy Pier ( 1 / 2 mile ) where there are plenty of things to do including shopping and boat and bus tours . We walked three blocks to Micah ##ael Jordan ’ s St ##eak ##house on Michigan Ave for dinner one night . The hotel bar had good cocktail ##s and there was Star ##bu ##cks in the hotel for a moderately priced quick breakfast . Our room was spacious and had a great view of downtown . It was also clean and comfortable . The bell ##man also helped us with a transportation problem when our airport shuttle failed to show . If I were going back , I would definitely choose the She ##rato ##n grand . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was looking fi ##r a hotel with a good pool fi ##r an overnight with ##y granddaughter . The Intercontinental was rated in the top five . Between the high rating and the competitive rate I chose the Intercontinental . I added the family package for $ 50 more which paid for itself . The staff was super a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting for me and my granddaughter and she had the time of her life . I appreciate all the extra ##s the hotel did for me and my granddaughter . For those who are grandparents you know it ’ s all ah ##e grandchildren . I am booking a stay for May when my daughter can accompany us we are looking forward to our next adventure at the Intercontinental . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We heard that the rooms were small - noisy - lots of ne ##gat ##ivity . Sorry - but we really enjoyed it ! Love ##d our room - even though we had the view of the fire escape ( we just closed the curtains ! Bed was very comfortable . Very uniquely decorated . The fellow that brought up our luggage was great fun ! G ##ave us lots of things to do and places to go . We were there for a wedding and really enjoyed connecting at the bar for drinks and app ##eti ##zers with the cousins ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I grew up in Chicago , but never really experienced the city much . My husband and I decided to stay downtown while visiting family and I am happy we chose Hotel Monaco . The service was mostly friendly and we loved the happy hour , in ##fused water and coffee in the morning . We didn ' t eat in , but ordered desert up to our room and it was great . We wish snack ##s and extra ##s were cheaper because we would have bought them . Location was perfect . . . walking distance to everything we wanted to enjoy . . . including post Christmas shopping at " Fields " , coffee at Intel ##ligent ##sia , dinner at G ##ino ##s , drinks at the Elephant and pop ##corn at G ##ar ##rets ! Because of our trip , we became Kim ##pton members and stayed at a place in Minneapolis and loved it too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for a business trip and the staff was very helpful . I was able to drop my bag off very early in the morning , and was called when my room was ready . I was able to quickly get my bag and head up to my room , which had a great view of the John Hancock building . El ##eva ##tors were fast and a handful were available . Room was super quiet , and had everything I could want and more . High ##ly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently checked in for one night over the weekend . Hotel appeared nice and clean , room was a decent size , and staff generally helpful . However , after arriving back in the U . K . I noticed a $ 24 charge appear on my credit card statement . After several expensive phone calls to the hotel , I ' m still waiting for a re ##fu ##nd and confirmation email . For this has ##sle alone I would avoid this hotel in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here one night for a Saturday wedding . V ##ER ##Y I ##MP ##RE ##SS ##ED ! The lobby is all so ##phi ##stic ##ation and el ##egan ##ce . The hallway ##s and sleeping rooms are all vibrant , colorful , sleek and modern , with red ##s , orange ##s , yellow ##s being the main color scheme . The building is all triangle angles , which makes the walk down the hall interesting , but don ' t worry , the rooms are regular layout ##s . Superior King room - - comfortable bed , good night ' s sleep , large and spacious bathroom with both tub and shower . Bright and clean everywhere . The rate is very reasonable for downtown . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent well - priced property , one block off Miracle Mile and two blocks from the river . Pleasant ##ly surprised by the proximity to fantastic Eat ##aly location on the same block . Navy Pier a straight ten minute wa ##l to the east . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was given a 20 % coup ##on after I booked a room , so I called to take advantage of it and went through a lot of has ##sle . An hour later , I got the discount but they changed my room to a smaller room without my knowledge . I called to complain and the man ##ger said she will give me the corner room back as a courtesy , which was red ##ic ##ulous since all I was doing was taking advantage of the coup ##on they offered without con ##ting ##encies . While reviewing our re ##ceipt at the hotel we noticed lots of fees . We ordered pizza and drink for $ 33 and ended up paying about $ 100 . They also double billed but fixed it after we noticed . I loved the modern hotel design , clean ##liness and the great location on magnificent mile but the service was disappointing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was very clean , very con ##fort ##able , employees very nice and helpful ##l . Including reception ##ist , con ##sie ##rge , bell ##man , waiter at the bar . I had a nice time . I think it lacks a regular restaurant for informal meals . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This has become 1 of 2 hotels that I use when I travel for work to Chicago . Nice rooms , friendly staff , and great location in Chicago . The bar / restaurant also a solid for those wanting to stay in . Also adds a decent gym for those trying to keep the exercise going when on the road . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here since 11 / 9 checking out today for a family vacation . The best location , room is clean , service is outstanding . . ( thanks for the welcome amenities ) ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly the hotel made our family trip more memorable ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad has a lot going for it especially the location . The rooms aren ' t huge but are comfortable and pretty modern . I expected a bit more being it ' s the No . 4 hotel in Chicago but it ' s still a good hotel . Didn ' t think much if the restaurant but there are so many options around it . The facilities are good and a new rooftop bar has opened up while we were there which was great . Staff are all very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Maxwell at the front desk was great ! ! Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and made sure that all our needs were met . Easy parking and very nice and clean junior suite . Everyone also followed social di ##stan ##cing protocol . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has some of the best service we ’ ve had . Everyone from the bell stand to the front desk agent was friendly and nice . They gave us 5 star service at every turn . Pro ##s : - The location - The friendly service - Clean Con ##s : - Club Lounge lacked . There were mini bottles of water , no snack ##s , and terrible “ breakfast ” - Old rooms [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the hotel in April and when I arrived , I was upgraded and given the VIP treatment which was absolutely amazing . I was given a free welcome drink ticket and had a delicious Burt Reynolds at Booth One . Travis was the name of my host and he could not have been more helpful . He suggested some restaurants in the area and also recommended I take the river architecture tour . I had previously done the tour on another trip to Chicago and I can say it is a great experience . Travis even sent up a bucket of beers to my room . The overall experience and customer service was honestly re ##f ##reshing and I felt appreciated and welcome at their hotel . I ordered room service from Booth One and it was also delicious . When I need a place to stay in Chicago , I will be back at the Ambassador . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker with my Wife for my birthday weekend . Hotel was convenient ##ly located near all the activities we had planned . We received imp ##ec ##ca ##ble service from the Bell Boy ' s to the Front Des ##k staff at check out . Staff is extremely friendly and professional . They even gave us surprise room service of Champagne for my Birthday ! I would definitely recommend this iconic & historical hotel to anyone looking for an amazing experience ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Love ##ly room . Dec ##ent service for the price . I asked the front desk to have house ##keeping do a turn down as I found a trash can in my room had not been emptied prior to my checking in . When I returned after dinner , I found a bottle of red wine , a Lin ##dt chocolate bar and a lovely note of apology from house ##keeping . These people get it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , beautiful hotel , very clean , staff was very knowledge ##able and friendly . F ##au ##ce ##t in bath tub / shower area needed fixed or replaced , but worked . Would like routine room cleaning resumed not having to request it daily . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Love ##d everything about this hotel except how they took advantage of how busy Chicago was the weekend we stayed . I get the concept of supply / demand , but it felt like they took advantage of it and over ##charged beyond a reasonable level . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They let us check in at 10 ##AM which was great . The rooms and hotel were very clean and the views and location were spectacular . We didn ' t ear there so we can ##t comment on the food . I would definitely stay here again . . . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been staying at this hotel for the last 7 years . On this trip the property was not up to par . The amenities in the room were very sparse and not re ##ple ##nti ##shed over the four days . The employees were not friendly as in past visits . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in an ideal spot . Right by the water and so close to parks , restaurants and so much to do . It was a tiny room where everything in it cost extra though . Overall I would stay again as the ideal location helps make up for the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was a pleasure working with this hotel for our regional meeting , Nina was very re ##sp ##ons ##ive and helpful with request from the very begging of planning our meeting . On - site it was great working with Nina and the banquet team , Win ##fried and Chelsea were great to work with and were on top of everything the meeting attendees needed . Very positive experience and felt all of the staff were there to support our meeting and help it to be a success . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location was excellent , easily accessible . Beautiful ##ly appointed at every level . Professional and court ##eous , yet friendly , staff . My room was clean and comfortable . I look forward to coming back in the near future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a nice 5 night stay in downtown Chicago . The front desk is on the 20th floor , as are some of the amenities . Nice views from that level at breakfast , which was good , but price ##y . There is a nice gym on the 8th floor . The rooms were clean and the staff was very nice . Almost everything is walk ##able from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was in Chicago for a convention and the convention hotel was over booked . I found this place right around the corner , which has been newly re ##mo ##del ##ed and got a corner suite for about half the price of Downtown Chicago Hotels . As I was there at a conference , I didn ' t eat at the hotel , but they do offer a small breakfast . Lots to do near by with great Taste of Chicago foods ! My corner suites had beautiful views of downtown Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location and loved the character of the property . If you wish to stay on Michigan Ave . this is well placed and not too busy around the entry ##way . Will have to try the pool next time , did not come prepared on this visit - - beautiful space . Would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here for just one night but I was so impressed with their customer service I had to write a review . The woman who checked us in was amazing . She didn ’ t forget a thing : parking , late check - out , texts if you need anything . I stay at a lot of hotels and they just really impressed me . The breakfast in the morning was delicious and the hotel is right across the street from the theater where Hamilton is playing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed a room with river view . The room smelled must ##y and wasn ’ t cleaned well . The window was extremely dirty so defeated the purpose of having a river view . We were moved to a room two doors down and that one was a little worse . The phone didn ’ t work and the bathroom was dirty . We were finally able to move to one of the renovated rooms which I guess there are some of those and it was a little better with new bed ##ding and some furniture . The lamp didn ’ t work by the bed but we could see out the window . Just not what we expected for the price and for a She ##rato ##n . Sc ##rat ##ching this one off the list . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed 6 nights at the So ##fit ##el Chicago and we loved it . The staff is really friendly and helpful , rooms are comfortable and nice , the bar downstairs is very good too . We used the gym that had everything you can need for a gym session out of home . Room service was quick and good too . The location for visiting around and shopping is perfect . So . . . as I said we loved it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Once again the Chicago O ##m ##ni made our stay outstanding . My 9 year old daughter and I stayed at the O ##m ##ni for the weekend of November 17 - 19 , 2017 to enjoy the holiday parade and all the festivities . We were able to stay in our same room again and they surprised her with milk and cookies too . The room service was excellent - from placing the order and delivery ( very cheerful staff members ) to the food . Room is clean and spacious - nice to have separate seating area to watch TV and eat . I will be back with a few friends in April for a shopping weekend . . . cannot wait ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] You can count on So ##fit ##el for consistency and quality . This hotel is central ##ly located , within walking distance of downtown Chicago , eat ##eries , and train connections . So ##fit ##el is easy to get to and easy to use . Try it - you ' ll return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In Chicago during February so not a peak time for visitors but the experience at Palmer House was fantastic . I stayed there on two different nights during my business - related trip to Illinois - and both I was upgraded via my Hilton Diamond membership without prompting . The Executive Lounge though relative busy was about the best E ##L experience that I have had for a while . It is an older hotel - so experiences may vary if in a lower floor room - but my room was large and with up to date furnishings . Additionally the hotel is near both the ' L ' and the subway lines - and a stone ' s throw from most Chicago down ##time spots to see . I would definitely try to stay here again if visiting Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The bathroom and shower floor had stain ##ing in the g ##rout , sides of van ##ity were dusty and overall looked worn . The toilet seat even had damage . We also had a hole in our sheets . Was a great location with nice staff , but room was a bit disappointing for the price we paid . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As far as city s ##cape ##s go , this is the best hotel view ! 29th floor with river and city view . Beautiful renovated room ( only double beds not queen . . but who can complain with that view ) . Staff was friendly and helpful . Short walk to Navy Pier , the next day down Michigan Ave to Mill ##eni ##um Park , and a short U ##ber ride to White Sox stadium . Wish we could stay longer ! ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We visited Chicago on a family vacation and decided to use air ##b ##n ##b . com , after arriving to the place we realized that it was not what we hoped . We found an available room at this hotel and they were able to get us in early in the morning . Everyone in the staff was super nice and welcoming . We want to thank them all especially K ##wa ##me who made sure our stay was a great one ! ! ! Chicago was amazing and the hotel is located in the middle of all the fun and activities . I will for sure stay there each time I visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As usual , the location of this So ##fit ##el hotel is excellent ( Downtown North ) ; service and rooms are very good . The view from the 15th floor is superb and im ##mers ##es you in the atmosphere of the city . Good breakfast and efficient v ##alet service . Re ##com ##men ##ded for a short business trip or for a visit to downtown Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago for a friend ' s wedding . The staff was extremely friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and knowledge ##able . They were re ##sp ##ons ##ive to any of our needs , and it made us have a very persona ##ble and welcoming experience here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My view was great . The taste of Chicago was in my eye sight an I was able to walk right across . Everything was in great distance for l ##y ##ft an walking an the views were amazing . Bed ##side ##s the w ##if ##i an the feathers in the pillow everything was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a modern hotel located near the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and walk ##able to the scenic river and surrounding area . My room was spacious , clean and bright . There is a good gym on the Fifth floor . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ing was a 25 dollar service fee I did not expect in addition to the Room rate even though that included a free happy hour drink and a minimal breakfast . The charge for v ##alet parking was 64 dollars . Check before you book ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff at the H ##ya ##tt Regency were very at ##ten ##tive . It ' s a lovely hotel with everything spaced out nicely and staff wore masks . My room was clean and had all things neatly in place . I stayed 3 nights and was there for a conference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Big room . Class ##y hotel with great staff . Currently missing re ##ast ##ra ##uts but nice bar . Was upgraded to top floor with excellent mini bar and huge room . Nice area in Chicago to remove yourself from downtown but still very close . Would recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ing at the Kim ##pton is one of my favorite things to do , from their exceptional customer service to their free use of bicycles , to a fun Happy Hour , and 312 cuisine is out of this world . This place and all other Kim ##pton Hotels truly make our trips memorable ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel , great location , service incredible ! Service was great and everything perfect ! Walking distance to everywhere and in a perfect location ! ! Everyone at the hotel super friendly and helpful ! ! I would come back in a heartbeat ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] What can I say ! We had a ma ##rve ##lous time . The hotel even though it has a history was well kept the room on the 19th floor with the Lake view was wonderful . We had a nice time period and I would like to visit again [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed with Home ##wood Suite ##s before , but on our last trip tried another " all suite " hotel . The Home ##wood is far superior . We had no complaints and enjoyed the hotel , as well as , the area ! I would highly recommend the River North Area for couples . There are many restaurants / bars within walking distance ( even in the cold ) . The hotel staff was very helpful , but also respect ##ful of you and your privacy . We liked the breakfast b ##uff ##et and it is different each morning . We didn ' t use the pool or fitness facility , so I have no opinion of those areas . All in all , it is a great hotel for the price and we will be back ! Oh , and I forgot to mention you are one block from Michigan Ave ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Chicago H ##ya ##tt Regency has historically been an excellent hotel . The Co ##vid - 19 pan ##de ##mic has seriously hurt all hotels and this one is no exception . Many guest service areas are closed or have decreased capacity , all in the west tower are closed . In ##ves ##ti ##gate needed and desired services carefully before booking any Chicago hotel stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Zero customer service nor amenities . Upon checking into room , prior guest had k ##et ##chu ##p container on floor so I imagine clean ##liness is sub par . Stay was reminiscent of a motel . In fact , I ’ d prefer no one on duty as the Sr . Manager of the property , Jason , was not only in ##ept but also completely in ##com ##pet ##ent and unwilling to provide any information nor help . The one thing he did provide was an attitude . Sad ##ly he couldn ’ t provide water . Pi ##llow ##s are about as effective as an airplane seat head rest ; water smells and tastes foul and lacks ve ##nding . Other than that , good location . Good luck . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful ##ly friendly staff from those working the door , to front desk , bartender ##s to house ##keeping . Each person was cheer ##y and eager to answer questions . The hotel is in a great location for walking around and about five ( or so ) blocks from the Blue Line L which comes in from O ' Hare . The rooms are clean and come with a fun view of the river and city ##sca ##pe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Breakfast ( we were com ##ped but normally not included ) very good . River view room nice E ##X ##CE ##P ##T - the de ##cor is WA ##Y too busy for our taste . Our son and his future bride loved it - but it was hard for us to relax with so many intense patterns bomb ##ard ##ing our senses . A little bit of wear showing here and there but not really objection ##able and everything was clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] traveled au ##g 2nd to au ##g 6th , i mistakenly submitted th ##ru the website au ##gus ##t 7th but was told when checking in that i wouldn ##t be charged if i was only staying until the 6th but yet i was charged and h ##ya ##tt CS ##R was unable to reverse the charge and said that he can ' t [SEP]
1	[CLS] They made my sons 10th birthday awesome . He and I both were impressed . The staff was very at ##ten ##tive and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . This is a trip my son will never forget . They sent birthday treats to the room twice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the ambassador for 19 , ye ##p , 19 nights in May 202 ##1 . The first three nights we did not realize there were draw down black ##out shades , sigh . The test of the time there was f ##abulous . I am H ##ya ##tt Global ##list and was upgraded to 911 and 91 ##5 . I ’ d recommend 91 ##5 for the corner room view but 911 was more spacious with larger closet ##s . Staff was very friendly , location can ’ t be beat . Hotel is pretty minimal ##ist but gets the job done . When the restaurant opens this will be a f ##abulous pick . Until then , my biggest complaint is that the front desk staff puts on a plastic glove every time they serve you coffee — no need to waste that my friends ! We ’ ll be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room was larger than expected . Bath ##room was as small as expected . Everything else was great . Park ##ing and valid ##ation went better than I recall for other hotels . Re - use of spaces that housed long time restaurants and bars was done well . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First time at the Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago , the city where I was born & haven ’ t been back since 1980 . But what an amazing experience . Thank You H ##U ##G ##O for your love & great hospitality . Will be coming back and staying at this beautiful hotel . My view was amazing facing navy pier and the whole trip was just perfect even if it was a business trip . As Hugo had mentioned to me that management is on point and I believe it , as all the staff was friendly and at ##ten ##tive . Thank you again for making my business trip the best one so far ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very friendly who made us feel welcome and followed up with me about possibly leaving my credit card . They really didn ’ t have to do that , but they went out of their way to do so . It was much appreciated ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Dec ##ided to take a last minute trip to Chicago and got lucky with a great rate . Room was great and the location can ' t be beat . Not a great view ( back of other hotel ) however the room was very comfortable and it ' s an easy walk or car service ride to just about anywhere . Very historical and beautiful lobby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I had a great time at this hotel . We stayed there this past weekend checking in on Friday and checking out on Sunday . The location is perfect . We were in Chicago for a family event that took place on Friday early evening . We had several meals in Michael Jordan ' s steak ##house ( located in the hotel ) and thought both the food and the service to be excellent ( better than excellent ) . We really love staying in Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal hotels when we stay in large cities . They are always well run and professional . I look forward to our next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here on a short break last week . Excellent breakfast . Room spot ##less and comfortable , price per night very competitive . I ##ma ##gin ##ative lunch menu , again delicious food at competitive prices . At ##tract ##ive , well furnished public rooms . Help ##ful staff . Good v ##ibe . What not to like ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great value with breakfast and dinner included . Family friendly with suites to accommodate groups of families . Close to shopping on North Michigan Avenue . Clean refurbished rooms . I was in Chicago on a business trip . I would recommend it to others . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great location and amenities ! Very friendly staff at the fitness center and pool . I will definitely book this hotel again ! I did not use much else at the hotel but I would recommend this for business or family trips . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was fine - nothing great . Park ##ing for $ 62 a night seems steep for guest . Don ’ t expect any compliment ##ary bottle ##d water in the rooms . Front desk service was great . Bed ##s were comfortable . Bath ##room small . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located downtown Chicago , convenient ##ly near shopping and dining area , also walking distance from the lake , this hotel has few restaurants inside and also offers great views . Of course it is on a price ##y side , but if you are traveling in the winter time and love the wind city in the winter - - then this is the place to stay . Everyone is very friendly and helpful . They know the area well and can give you recommendations . Room ##s were clean and had ne ##sp ##ress ##o coffee machines as well as soft drinks and water . R ##ope and slip ##pers and toilet ##ries were also available and if you run out you could ask the front desk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We cannot say enough about the warm welcome and effort that the staff at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker went to , to make our visit memorable . They made sure that the birthday visit for my best mate of 46 years was extra special - cans of Guinness , cheese board and birthday cake . Jason and his staff were superb and made our trip . The rooms are large , the hotel had what we needed and the location is excellent . Thanks to all ! ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] After ##noon , can son ##won ##e p ##ls ##e respond to my email and phone call , i was charged an extra $ 800 doll ##lars , i need this resolved as ##ap , why take money out of my account without author ##isation when i have already pain in full Linda [SEP]
1	[CLS] We found the Talbot ##t to be very fresh in de ##cor , very clean and the service was very good . Love the location and bout ##ique hotels and this one did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . We were always greeted at the front door by the bell ##man and everyone throughout the hotel was very helpful . Would have liked the option to rent an in - room movie but other than that loved the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Guest services folks were great . The restaurant 312 was disappointing because I was seated but did not see anyone for 10 minutes so I left . Great location since I was there for one night so I could see Hamilton and it was good for that . The room was V ##ER ##Y small though quiet . Probably the reason I am not giving it a higher rating is because they charge $ 16 per day for w ##i - for . Mo ##tel 8 provides w ##i - fi . Just a bit shocked . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We spent couple of days downtown Chicago and Ken ##zie Hotel was a p ##amp ##ering perfect choice . Very convenient ##ly located it gave us the opportunity to do a lot of exploring on foot . P ##lent ##y of f ##abulous restaurants and shopping close by . Our room was very spacious with modern and warm furnishings and all the p ##amp ##ering features I desire in a hotel room . A generous bathroom with a tub and co ##zy robes and toilet ##ries I enjoyed . Very comfortable king size bed with blind ##s that aloud us to sleep in . Good w ##if ##i cone ##xi ##ón without the need of complicated password ##s . Free full continental breakfast and also compliment ##ary drinks with snack ##s between 5 and 7 : 00 pm . Very friendly staff and to top it all dog friendly . High ##ly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Inc ##red ##ible hotel with a magnificent view . Couldn ' t have been any happier . We will stay here again ! Easy access to everything ! Every member of staff was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Clean - top notch ! The river walk is just outside the door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our N ##A ##EL ##A Summit experience was excellent . Central ##ly located and easy walk to shopping and theater district . I recommend the Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium Park for a conference or a weekend show stop . Chicago pizza is close so have your fill . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Central ##ly located in the Loop . Walking distance to great restaurants and shopping . Te ##rri ##fic coffee and tea served in the lobby to start your day and wine hour starting at 5 to end the day - a perfect combination . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Chicago is a great location with beautiful rooms . However the shining star of this hotel is their staff . They are court ##eous , well informed and there to make your stay a delight . Our second stay and we will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was wonderful . Your beds / bed ##ding are heaven ! Great location , lovely sitting area outside , fantastic staff . Our stay was postponed from January due to weather . We were celebrating my daughters 17th birthday . Linda Ng ##uy ##en in reservations had a p ##latter of delicious sweet ##s and a happy birthday card signed by the staff in the room when we arrived . Are you serious ? ? ? Who does that ? ? ? So ##fit ##el does ! Wow . Guest for life . Thanks Linda and So ##fit ##el . See you in January for birthday # 18 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we got to our upgraded room , the counter tops and desk top were thick with dust , the kind that a ##cc ##um ##ulates over days . The carpet was either not vacuum ##ed or vacuum ##ed care ##lessly . No K ##leen ##ex in the di ##spense ##r . And as a bonus , the next morning there was no hot water in the bathroom . We had far better service in third world country hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] That was just one night in s ##wi ##sso ##tel ch ##ica ##go unfortunately . the Hotel is very well located with a great view . Room ##s is modern and provide us everything me and my family needed . The Hotel doesn ' t offer breakfast b ##uff ##et . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is really a nice hotel , with a great room and overall great staff . Very clean and the food was good . The only problems were the slow service at The Palm , 2 out of 3 times , the poor TV channel selection and the elevators . Once you figure out how the elevators work , you realize it ' s ing ##eni ##ous . It took me about 3 trips in the elevator to figure it out . In the meanwhile , I felt like an idiot . How about a little hand ##out at check in to describe how the elevator works ? I would return - it was a very pleasant stay , overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff is amazing , especially Dan in the Bar ! Hotel is clean . Free wine in the afternoon is very nice and the all day coffee and water is wonderful . Have stayed her several years on a row and am never disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel as an excellent location ; quick walk to River ##front and all that that offers , and many restaurants and much shopping within a quick walk . Co ##m ##fort ##able rooms and outstanding staff . Area seemed very safe , although noisy at time . Star ##bu ##cks in the lobby , but the rooms also have coffee ##makers . Excellent views as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have not stayed at many She ##rato ##ns previously , but now that She ##rato ##n is part of Mar ##riot ##t , I see the consistency that Mar ##riot ##t is known for . Nice room with a good view of the river . Su ##ff ##icient space to work and relax . One issue was that we had checked - in on the mobile app early in the morning , but there was no record of that and our preferred king bedroom was not available . The two queen beds do make the room a little crowded . Somehow , the coordination of their mobile and other systems needs work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 4 nights on a visit from Florida . Excellent location just off Michigan Ave . We were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go . Hotel staff was friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Craig , one of the bell ##men , gave us great food recommendations . Our room was 2 doubles . Bed ##s were amazing ##ly comfortable . Bath ##room was large and well appointed . Mini bar was well stock ##ed . I had breakfast one morning in the Nix restaurant . I just wanted a bag ##el and cream cheese which they did and it was delicious . Love ##ly lobby area and a nice bar with comfortable tables as well as bar stool ##s . Got a great rate , we will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a bout ##ique hotel located in River North . The bed is comfortable and it has all of the necessary amenities . There is a small gym and breakfast is free . There is room service from the restaurant next door ( not sure if same owner ) , but there are also a lot of options within a short walk . Nice place to stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s a bit of a late review , but had to write it anyway . I stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in July of 2015 . Perfect location . Very easy going hotel , simple but ch ##ic . Personnel knows their job and are very kind and eager to help out . Room ##s were very comfortable and clean . Breakfast served on every single floor is a real convenience . The fruit in ##fused ice - cold water available in the lobby was a very nice touch . We were there for a get away week - end to explore Chicago for the first time . We ' ll go back , and will definitely stay again at the Ki ##nz ##ie . Thanks guys . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Me and my sister stayed at this hotel for a girls weekend . We are SP ##G members and expected this hotel to meet our standards for amazing . Everything was very nice , clean and lovely . Bed ##ding was amazing . Show ##er had great water pressure and compliment ##ary coffee and tea . When we checked in they offered a special deal on the VIP room for snack ##s n drinks at happy hour and breakfast next morning Did not enjoy that at all . Was way to crowded . Now ##here to sit Food only let looked ok . We went down to the desk and they re ##fu ##nded our money since we didn ' t utilize the service and they gave us free breakfast in the bi ##stro that was amazing ! ! ! ! ! The b ##urger joint in the bottom floor was really good also . This was a very nice place to stay and close to so many attractions . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There is strike going on because this hotel probably mist ##rea ##ts their employees . Every time you leave the hotel you have to walk through pick ##et lines . Room ##s are small and dated . There ’ s a lot of street noise and drums banging all day because of the strike . Location is okay but not great . Fitness center is ridiculous ##ly priced $ 15 a day for use , my whole month membership for my gym at home is $ 22 . When I mentioned this to the desk person I was told ‘ welcome to ch ##ica ##go ’ . Sorry but I live in Philadelphia and regularly visit NYC and I ’ ve travelled all over the world so I think I ’ m familiar with a big city . Don ’ t appreciate trying to be big timed by hotel staff when I ’ m paying to stay in your hotel . No other hotels charge for use of a fitness center . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to Chicago for a quick weekend get ##away and this hotel and staff made it the trip of a lifetime ! The door ##man , Perry Martin ##is , was phenomena ##l ! He knew great places for us to go see and amazing restaurants for us to eat at . The location is central to just about everything making it easy to see the sites . The food and cocktail ##s at the bar in the lobby are great and the staff is very friendly there as well ! All in all , wonderful trip made even better by the staff and great experience at The Talbot ##t [SEP]
1	[CLS] I like everything about this hotel with just the exception of the size . I used spot ##her ##o to find a parking just a block away saving almost 1 / 2 the cost . Overall nice stay , just the room size did not match what we saw online . [SEP]
1	[CLS] GM Anderson and his staff made this special trip memorable . He and his staff cater ##ed to our every need and request . Clean and quality rooms attended to by exceptionally friendly employees . We highly recommend you make this your destination ! In our opinion the Talbot ##t is a 5 Star property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent stay . This is a well situated hotel with all the necessary amenities and a very helpful staff . Well priced in comparison to the other options in Street ##er ##ville . High ##ly recommend for any stay in Chicago . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went with another couple and loved this hotel . The rooms were very large , modern . There was always compliment ##ary water . The bathroom ##s were very large with 2 sinks . The location was amazing right near all the shops and lots of restaurants we walked everywhere [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is well situated in downtown Chicago . At ##tended a four day 2017 Crow ##e Ho ##r ##wat ##h Annual Conference there . Had a great room on the 36th floor with a view of Millennium Park . Room , amenities , service and meeting rooms were great for the price . Would consider this hotel in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed on 32nd floor for 3 nights . Super ##b beds and pillows . Re ##com ##men ##d the on site b ##urger joint ( Chicago Burger Co ) for lunch near the canal . Dec ##ent meeting / board rooms . Very helpful staff on Re ##ception Des ##k . Walking distance to Navy Pier & Michigan Ave ( shopping ) . Happy to recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had contacted hotel prior to going and requested a nice room as we had a double celebration whilst there . What seemed like a positive reply was received . On arrival we were allocated a room . Whilst it was functional it was small and tired . There was no literature in room about hotel facilities including t ##v or W ##i - Fi . No information had been given at all at check in not even what floor the room was on . In feed back to Ex ##ped ##ia I stated these facts and bet ##el replied that they were ‘ media ##ting direct ’ with me . That was a lie no communication took place at all . The hotel is in a great location for all amenities and the waterfront . It was disappointing that it was let down . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter had to go to Chicago for business so I tag ##ged along for fun . This hotel was wonderful . The room was very nice and clean . The bed super comfortable with nice linen . Bath / shower was very nice as well . Custom ##er service was very good . Con ##cier ##ge was very helpful and gave us coup ##ons and great suggestions for what to see . My suggestion would be to go on the Architectural River Tour at the beginning of your visit . We did that the 1st day we were there and viewed the buildings in a different light than had we not done that . Hotel food was good but expensive . I only used the pool once and am giving the hotel 4 stars because there is not ah ##ot tub . Hot tub would have gotten that 5th star . Photo ##s are views from the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Large suites , indoor pool , morning and evening snack ##s , and the perfect location make this hotel the perfect choice for families ! Walking distance to the River ##walk , 360 Chicago , Mill ##eni ##um Park and according to my kids - the best of all - N ##ute ##lla cafe ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I bid on the Presidential Suite at a silent auction and got it , so we made a weekend of it . Aside from not having our bags moved from one room to another as promised , our stay was pleasant . The presidential suite was H ##U ##GE but is a little worn for the wear but still worth the bid ! Great Location - close to everything . The weather could have been better but this is Chicago in the fall after all . We got a change to use the gym , hot tub and ate in the restaurant . The meal was really good , so this shouldn ' t be overlooked as an option on your stay . I would do a stay ##cation here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location s ##nd am ##bie ##nce . Room ##s neat and well organized . To ##ile ##t kept running after cleaning service came - ni ##thing was done to correct this . Main ##tens ##nce man knocked on door several times and rang bell , awake ##ning me in panic , to deliver a ##vre ##mote control that I never asked for ! ! ? ! ? ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel was in a great location with plenty of great shopping , restaurants and just plain areas to walk to ! The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , service was excellent , rooms were very comfortable , well kept building with many great features ! The attended convenient parking was a nice feature ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel location is perfect right in down town Chicago very nice rooms and clean . Park ##ing is horrible and extremely expensive to v ##alet park , no parking on street Chicago tow trucks are always on the move . Over all comparable bed , clean bath room it would have been nice if breakfast would be better nothing to offer but very expensive junk food , give me a break management Price was super chip it was off season so got a great bargain . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Another great experience at O ##m ##ni Chicago . Annual get ##away that never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s . They are top notch ! Great service always by bell staff , front desk , and house ##keeping . Medina , Crystal and Cassandra are outstanding . They keep us coming back every year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at this hotel in room 270 ##8 and were very happy with the experience . The rooms are average , but the location is great . I have to mention N ##est ##or , the spa supervisor . He helped us with the language barrier because he speaks Spanish , and because of that we new what to do and see in Chicago . We do not speak English very well so his help was very much appreciated . A friend of ours is helping to write this review because it ’ s worth it to mention people like him . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Club lounge was great , Big Bar has great drinks but limited bar menu , great location from which to enjoy Chicago and river walk . V ##ib ##rant lobby to meet . Staff was extremely friendly and helpful . Will be back . H ##ya ##tt Ex ##p ##lor ##ist [SEP]

1	[CLS] Great location , nice room , com ##fy bed , all for a good price . The window seats make the room special . . . Good place to curl up with a book or just enjoy the view . And the staff is top notch , " smiling faces and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting attitudes ! " [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel located in great location downtown . Our hotel room was decorated with modern de ##cor . Only negative is that room is smaller than your average hotel room . I didn ' t mind . Hotel staff friendly and check in and out was quick . I would recommend the hotel and would stay there again . [SEP]

1	[CLS] The Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker was a great hotel to stay at for our weekend away . It had a prime location close to all the shops . A ##wes ##ome ma ##rt ##ini bar with a wonderful staff . The overall value of the hotel was amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It would have been perfect but for a few amenities . Li ##q ##uo ##r license and door man would have been great . Other staff tried to make up for missing items , but I have difficulty walking and the extra steps were cum ##bers ##ome . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is hard to figure out where to stay safely in a large city . I loved the location and the v ##ibe of the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . The staff was friendly and helpful . The nearby restaurants , Siena Tavern and R ##oast were excellent , as well as the evening entertainment at the Red head piano bar . Breakfast was good , and the evening happy hour was a nice per ##k . Located just one block from the river and about 4 blocks from Millennium Park made this a great place to stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is class ##y and elegant . The rooms are just so wonderful ##ly relaxing with contemporary modern touches . I can ' t wait to visit again . The foyer and lounge areas adjacent to the conference rooms are relaxing . The conference rooms are inviting as well . I highly recommend this establishment . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We took the morning tour of the historical Hilton Chicago , and it was perhaps the best decision of the trip . Jessica was a great tour guide : she was very knowledge ##able and enthusiastic . Also , she got us into some sweet behind - the - scenes locations including the ballroom and the Imperial Suite ##s . Jessica made the tour so much fun and we learned so much ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean , comfortable , and s ##ty ##lish bout ##ique hotel . The staff was excellent and so helpful and friendly from the very start . We were crab ##by ( unrelated ! ) when we arrived , and they did everything possible to make things easy for us from that point forward . They accommodate ##d a very early check in , were great with v ##alet and bell services , and held packages for us . They even upgraded our room to an absolutely fantastic one with a great river view . Room ##s are a great size , which we have learned the hard way is not always the case downtown Chicago . We will be back for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always a pleasure staying at the H ##ya ##tt - check in process was sea ##m ##less , and the staff was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I asked for an upgrade , room on the 30th floor or higher and late check out . All three requests were accommodate ##d , no questions asked . The bed was comfortable and the view of the city / River Front , perfect ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel with great views . Bus ##y weekend with Chicago marathon going on , but staff and everyone here are amazing . The food is outstanding . Beautiful views of the river and very convenient location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Family of 5 stayed here for one night and found the check - in process to be a breeze , the room to be clean and well appointed , and the location to be un ##beat ##able . Downs ##ides were that the pull out couch was thin and all springs ( kids didn ' t care ) , and the w ##i - fi was terrible to the point where we turned our w ##i - fi off . Great hotel though with a nice central location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here last weekend , great location to see Downtown Chicago and easy walking access to most of what you want to see . Very central and the river views are great . The rooms are a little dated , but still nice and well maintained . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a great hotel , as expected from Fair ##mont . It added a nice levels of comfort and luxury to a business trip . It didn ’ t feel like the usual corporate hotels which is often the case with convention / business hotels . The location is great to get around Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was clean , friendly and is well located for a great city break in Chicago . Room was warm and inviting , shower was great , good pressure even on 16th floor . Staff were friendly and welcoming and at ##ten ##tive without being over ##be ##aring ( which I always appreciate ) Would recommend highly [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I just stayed here for our anniversary weekend . The room was charming with a nice view of the river . The staff was very friendly and helpful . The wine hour in the lobby was awesome ! The only things preventing a 5 star rating was the bathroom was a bit out ##dated and the towels were pretty rough . Overall we enjoyed our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are very spacious and very clean . The hotel ' s location was in a perfect spot downtown for me . It was in walking distance to Union Station , Millennium Park , Lincoln Park , several museums and other activities . The staff was very friendly - and did I mention how clean the room was . : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Amazing location off Michigan a ##ve . And beds were comfortable . Have to mention great guy at front desk , Justin . And Adrian in rest ##ura ##nt was super cool and finally Ham who helped at our car was wonderful ! Really nice stay for a weekend in the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great value with convenient location . Staff is wonderful and went out of their way to ensure we had a great stay . Have stayed there three times in the past and always feel welcomed . The proximity of shopping , eat ##eries , and entertainment is also an advantage . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in a good location , close to the Michigan Avenue bridge . Although the bathroom floor had not been m ##opped , the rest of the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable . The view of the river area was impressive . The restaurant was over ##p ##rice ##d , but we found an Amazon Go store a block away that had reasonably priced breakfast items . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were going to Hamilton and this hotel was nearby , and quite famous , so we booked here . So very disappointing . Room ##s were very small which would have been ok if they hadn ' t tried to c ##ram so much furniture in it that you had to turn sideways to get around to the bed ( and we are not large ) . Bath ##room also tiny with inadequate towel bars . If you want coffee in your room , you must ask and pay for a coffee ##maker on check in , which we did not know . I did complain and was provided one for the following day g ##rat ##is , but what a policy ! Lo ##bby and public areas are nice . Service in the bar is none ##xi ##stant , good luck finding a waiter and getting served . The cafe service was good and food good . Won ' t stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I travel nearly every week for business . The O ##m ##ni Chicago property continues to be my favorite . The service and the people make the stay . And the rooms themselves are comfortable and spot ##less . High ##ly recommend to anyone ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently stayed at the H ##ya ##tt Regency from Friday - Friday , partly for person and the majority for work . When staying this long it would be helpful to have a small fridge for the long stay . They wanted to charge $ 25 per day . Un ##believable and quite frankly , the woman at the front desk was very rude about it . Just rubbed me the wrong way . De ##b & Juan at St ##ets ##on ' s were amazing ! If I had to rate the entire experience just on them , it would be 5 stars . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The place was very clean and nice everyone was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting Anything you needed someone was there if you just needed an answer or you had to do was text a question if you have a question about Internet you texted it they sent to you an answer very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fitness room not real well equipped . . some equipment including P ##elle ##tron Nice room service staff . . decent food . Nice suites . One bottle water for being high level select guest . O ##m ##nis are consist ##ant in quality for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at the New Reno ##vated Home ##wood Suite ##s . The room was nice and spacious for us 2 ; the kitchen was very nice and the bath as well ( with a little bit of water stain over shower ) ; the breakfast ##s were nice and the receptions were good as well . Staff was very nice and helpful . I would definitely stay again . Home ##wood Suite ##s is one of my Favorite Hotels anyway ##s . Thanks for fantastic Stay ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were welcomed cheerful ##ly every time we entered the building . The meals were remarkable . The room was amazing and very comfortable , we called it our little apartment . The view from pool was gorgeous . I would stay here over and over . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thor ##ough ##ly enjoyed my stay , I can honestly say that I don ' t have one complaint . Stay ##ed for 3 nights and all enjoyable . The location is perfectly situated in the city but very peaceful nights . The staff was pleasant and the rooms were clean . I will be back . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My room was large . I didn ##t pay extra for a view but still had a nice city view . I locked myself out of my room and Ms . Angela East . with Security helped me get a new key . She was helpful and very sweet ! I enjoyed my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a q ##ua ##int and re ##mo ##del ##ed older hotel in the heart of downtown on W ##ack ##er & W ##aba ##sh Avenue . It ' s close to a variety of restaurants , close to the river walk and shops . And most important , close to my husband ' s business meetings . The staff are friendly , the rooms are clean and comfortable . We enjoyed an architectural river ##boat tour this afternoon . It has been a great trip so far . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff at Talbot ##t Hotel is amazing and super friendly especially our house keeping Rosemary Miller whom was always there to help us out with anything we needed . We brought our dog and everyone was so nice with us . Amazing location ! ! In the middle of everything and dog friendly place where there are 2 parks to take our bull ##dog to the park and have fun with other dogs in the N ##ei ##gh ##bo ##ur hood . Thank you : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am so mad I cannot remember the name of the front desk woman . She was f ##abulous ! !

( literally ) This is my favorite B ##EC ##A ##US ##E of the staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve traveled to Chicago multiple times and stayed at various hotels . Upon arrival the service has been great . Bell ##man and Vale ##ts will tell you about deals in the area . Craig is phenomena ##l . Over a 5 night trip the first two nights the w ##if ##i didn ' t work on the 7th floor . I called multiple times and it was identified as a dead zone in the hotel . Lo ##l . Huh ? I talked with K ##wa ##me at the front desk and he was quick to put us in a new room . The room while an upgrade was a down ##grade at the same time . Me and my wife wanted to stream our shows during our date but the T ##v was di ##sable so you only got local channels and movie orders . G ##reed ##y . We ended up cancel ##ling our balance of the trip and booking another hotel for the remaining nights . Stay somewhere else when you come here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you are looking for a top notch hotel , this is it ! ! Fantastic rooms , excellent staff , near so much in Chicago . The only place I will stay when visiting . The restaurant and bar have great food , and service . This hotel has it all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here with a large group for a competition . The hotel did an excellent job a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting us and is beautiful with a great atmosphere . The staff went way above and beyond to take care of anything we needed which made life so nice and we could focus on the kids and their competition . Special shout out to De ##W ##ayne and Charles at the front door who were FA ##B ##U ##L ##O ##US as well as Angie in house ##keeping . She was happy to track down anything we needed . High ##ly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : F ##abulous location in middle of everything . That accounts for three stars rather than two . Pro for some , con for me : Family - oriented with very loud children in the halls after 10 : 30 at night . Not a great environment for a couple , but probably good for families . Con ##s : Soft bed wasn ' t great . Breakfast was me ##h and un ##hea ##lt ##hy : taste ##less coffee , white bread ##s , egg and sa ##usage , no fresh fruit . Yo ##gu ##rt in a big tub rather than individual containers . Vale ##t took over 20 minutes to get our car . Deal break ##er - - sheets had a chemical de ##ter ##gent smell . I am sensitive to a ##roma ##s , and sheets and pillow had an overwhelming scent of cheap de ##ter ##gent . U ##gh . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable bed . E ##ff ##icient elevators . Co ##m ##fort ##able meeting space . Steps away from Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile for shopping and dining . Across street from River Walk . Museums nearby as well as Maggie Dale ##y Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town for almost two months . Great property , quality service team and no headache ##s . Clean and professional , on site restaurants and bar are good my co - workers used In Room Din ##ing quite a bit and really liked the b ##urger in particular . Used the dry - cleaning quite a bit , not cheap but very high quality finished product . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always enjoy staying at Chicago ' s Intercontinental . Everyone always very welcoming from the door ##man upon arrival to the front desk and house ##keeping . I left the hotel , realized I left my phone charge ##r behind and they actually found it and had it waiting for me ! That was a first . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Conrad is central ##ly located just off the Mile . Room ##s were clean but very small , even for an executive room . Very crowded for 2 people with luggage - there wasn ' t anywhere to store the luggage or open it . There was a moth in our room that we couldn ' t kill and a hair on the beds ##p ##read upon our arrival . Walls were thin we could here the t ##v in the next room . House ##keeping did not vacuum well . I liked the bath sheets and quality of linen ##s . Lo ##bby is on the 20th floor . Would stay again if the price was right . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Selected because of good reviews . Ok Location and personnel attitude were good . Need ##s more servers at bar and restaurant . Room smells and de ##cor was in bad need of replacement . Would try another hotel next time . Te ##rrible view in bedroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first time staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . Will not be our last . King corner room was beautiful . Minor issue and something I wouldn ' t usually comment on : two whole sides of the room were glass and the hotel right across the street had its rooms ' windows facing us . It kind of s ##tun ##k to use the blind ##s for privacy , but that can ' t be fixed , unless bottom up blind ##s are installed . Only stayed one night but staff were genuinely friendly and helpful . We felt incredibly welcomed . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Although there was industrial action taking place while I was there , it didn ' t impact on the service or am ##eni ##ty of my stay . The rooms are extremely well appointed and comfortable and the location is wonderful , especially for visiting the Chicago Art Institute . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Too ##k the family to Chicago for a long weekend and we loved this hotel . The window seats with the view of the Chicago river were fantastic . The bathroom showed it ' s wear , but overall , the room was perfect for us . We were in easy walking distance of Grant Park and of the Water Tower and all spots in between . Hotel staff were friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We will stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quite possibly and most likely the finest hotel I ' ve stayed in this decade . Beautiful and class ##y throughout . Plus ##h carpet ##s and de ##cor on the bedrooms and the view from my room was second to none . Words won ' t do this place justice . The staff are exceptional . Very friendly . Location is first class . G ##ym is great . Do yourself a favour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Left sunny Florida to enjoy a mini winter vacation . It felt like home from the moment we arrive ! The staff is great & friend , very personal vs just being another guest in their hotel . En ##joy ##ed the evening happy hours & the morning past ##ries . The location is ideal because it is central ##ly located to many attractions , shopping , & restaurants . Just a simple cab ride took you where you needed to go . You will definitely find my family visiting again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Old charm hotel with modern touches and convenience ##s ! Beautiful view of Lake Michigan ! Go for a walk in the Park ! Excellent staff , very court ##eous and helpful . Beautiful place and bed very comfortable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From check - in to departure , the staff exceeded my expectations during my stay . Considering that it was for business travel , the hotel could have treated me as another road warrior but they did the opposite and made me feel like a part of the family . The hotel is clean , modern , friendly , and in the heart of the city . All that anyone can ask for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Mon ##oc ##o proved to be a top notch place to stay . The location was perfect , no taxi rides required . We had shopping to do in Water Tower to the north , dinner to the west , and theater tickets to the south , all blocks away . The facility was very s ##ty ##lish , clean , well appointed and the staff at ##ten ##tive and eager to please . I am sure i will return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very please with the location & helpful staff . The con ##cier ##ge was very friendly & helpful . Bed ##s were very comfortable and the food was quite good . The door ##men were very helpful with directions and advise . We would use this hotel again without hesitation . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The class , quiet and comfort of Hotel So ##fit ##el in the heart of Chicago makes this our choice of home away from home . Combined with nearby restaurants and easy , ready transportation choices , Hotel So ##fit ##el is where we go for excellent service and lush accommodation ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for a family weekend right before Christmas . We had tickets to Hamilton , so the location was perfect . The weather was cold , but the room was warm . The staff was friendly , but the room was a bit small for our needs . We had four adults and had to fit in two full sized beds . They were definitely not Queen . The bathroom was also very small . We ' re a pretty low maintenance family and not terribly f ##uss ##y about things , but this did squeeze us a bit . The room was attractive and comfortable . Breakfast was not included , but there were plenty of options very near by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great location where the staff is always friendly and helpful The Intercontinental is always our go - to hotel when staying in Chicago and it never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s ! We can ' t wait for many return trips ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I stayed in this hotel on St Patrick ' s day weekend , we were overwhelmed with how well we were taken care of by the extremely generous and helpful staff . The location was amazing , the hotel was clean , breakfast was located on every floor , there was a bar , views were breath ##taking , all for an extremely reasonable rate ! I would have expected this level of hotel to charge 3 - 4 times what we paid for the weekend we were there ! ! We couldn ' t have asked for anything more and will be recommend ##ing The Ki ##nz ##ie to all our friends ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel to Chicago a couple of times a year and always choose the O ##m ##ni Hotel . Staff and overall clean ##liness of hotel is always top notch . Best of all I love the convenience of it ' s location . I ' ve tried other hotels but always keep coming back to the O ##m ##ni because it feels like home away from home . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ' t say enough good about out stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . It ' s in en excellent part of town and close to just about everything you would want to do in the city . It ' s steps away from the River Walk ( Chicago River ) and a few blocks from Grant / Millennium Park . There are tons of great restaurants in the neighborhood , along with a Trade ##r Joe ' s for grocery needs . The front desk was very knowledge ##able when it came to recommendations for restaurants , etc . The room was great ; clean and spacious , with all the needed amenities ( safe , refrigerator , coffee maker , full size hair ##dr ##yer ) . The bed was very comfortable , as well . Overall , it was such an enjoyable stay , I will absolutely stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a magnificent grand hotel with plenty of history and charm , mixed with modern comfort ##s . I always felt safe , even as I walked the Downtown in the evening . The staff was tremendous throughout the property and self parking was available across the street . The hotel was easy to get to and from by car ; the " L " was easily accessible to move around town . The Fitness Center was huge and well equipped . The Palmer House is perfect for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had my daughter ' s wedding reception at Swiss ##ote ##l . The El ##eve Ball ##room was spectacular ! The guidance and assistance provided by the entire staff throughout our planning stage and up to the day of the event , were beyond expectation . We also blocked rooms for our guests . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions and service were superb ; our families and guests felt very welcome and comfortable . We ' re so glad that we chose Swiss ##ote ##l ; they made this event truly memorable ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is solid but they are still working out the kin ##ks post co ##vid . Original room was sub par ( c ##reak ##y a / c , no cold water from the sink , fire escape lights beam ##ing through our window ) but once we brought that to their attention , management was a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and switched our room for the next two nights and modified our bill . I did book using a 3rd party so I wonder if I had booked directly if we would have originally been placed in a better room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I went to Chicago for a short girls ' trip with my two daughters and cousin . I can ' t say enough about how we enjoyed our stay at Hotel Ki ##nz ##ie ! We loved how it was so personal . The rooms were wonderful and we felt like the staff was really watching out for us . We felt very safe ! The location couldn ' t have been better . Located right in the middle of everything on the river downtown . So many things in walking distance . We walked to dinner and a super cool t ##iki bar the first night . Hit a pin ##g - p ##ong club the second . We would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This isn ' t your typical Fair ##mont an certainly not worthy of 4 . 5 stars . It is dated , the staff can be in ##different and there are so many better options in Chicago that cost less and provide more in terms of style , service , and attention to detail . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came here this past weekend and the hotel is on a great location . Everything is in walking distance . You can ' t come to Chicago and not walk on the River Walk . The Navy Pier is so close and U ##BE ##R access is great from this location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We liked the central location to this hotel and the view near Navy Pier and many local restaurants . Our overnight stay was such a success after given an hour extra for later check in . Only down side is a bit busy when checking in . Or asking for quick questions . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Victoria and Te ##rik were absolutely incredible ! ! ! From the check in Victoria was so sweet and got us into an amazing room with a r ##ad view . She answered all of our questions and was a so professional ! We loved it here that we decided to stay another night ! Te ##rik handled the sea ##m ##less transition and helped ensure everything was the way we wanted ! These two amazing young individuals are what every hotel hospitality should dream to be ! Very polite and professional but most importantly happy ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly be coming back here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family traveled to Chicago for an extended July 4th holiday and stayed at the Kim ##pton Hotel Monaco . We enjoyed a wonderful hotel experience . The entire staff is friendly , court ##eous and professional . The entire hotel has been recently re ##mo ##del ##ed and all areas are in superb condition . The location of the hotel provides great access to the Chicago river and area restaurants and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Services ; From Vale ##t , to check in , restaurant , to the nice lady that fixed my cook to order o ##mel ##et breakfast was excellent . They even brought up to our room champagne & chocolate covered straw ##berries for our 40th Anniversary . We ordered room service 1 night and that was really good . There is a new Star ##bu ##cks 1 block away that has 4 floors to it . . . . huge . Our room was clean and decorated nice . We were on the 25th floor ( highest floor ) , very quite . If you want to people watch on Michigan Avenue , I would recommend between the 6th - 15th floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful , sleek property . Excellent food and service , No ##yan ##e R ##oof ##top is perfection . Extreme ##ly friendly and helpful staff . Excellent , pro ##mpt , resource ##ful Sales Team . Great location in River North area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would definitely be staying here again ! Beautiful de ##cor and atmosphere , both in the room and in the lobby . Walk - able location to Michigan Ave . Park ##ing is a little steep at $ 65 for a night for v ##alet , but there are a few garage ##s in the area with a cheaper price tag . The hotel bar and restaurant are amazing , also they have a great happy hour 5 ##pm - 7 ##pm at the bar ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great meal with such a fantastic selection of vegetables in the Bai ##n Marie . If one went hungry it certainly was not the fault of the kitchen . The selection and the prices were also very exceptional . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Once again , we had a wonderful stay at the Chicago Hilton on Michigan Avenue . Ms . Cary ##n G ##ara ##ga ##y , Mr . David Tin ##sley and Vincent ##e all worked to create an exceptional customer service experience . We had a quick weekend to Chicago and chose this hotel because they provide us with a wonderful " home away from home " in a great location ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] An excellent hotel ! The location is quite good , the service was very good and the overall hotel is quite nice . Being pet friendly is great and I also appreciate the call once I left my dogs alone for a little while and they got a bit loud - I could come back right away without bothering other guests too much and most of all without distress ##ing my dogs ! Only negative points are the room size ( bit small ) and expensive parking ( but there are plenty options around ) . I would return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Poor service Dirty room Bath sink area not cleaned from prior ##S ##ta ##y ##N ##o front desk staff to check ##out at 630 ##am ##R ##esta ##ura ##nt opens at seven am ##N ##eed ##s improvement won ’ t stay here again not worth price Small elevators [SEP]
0	[CLS] Pro ##xi ##mity to the Star ##bu ##cks R ##oast ##ery prompted this choice and I am very happy with the Conrad ! The room was lovely , and the staff were very at ##ten ##tive and welcoming . I would happily stay here again . For some reason they insist on 200 characters , so I will pad it out a little . Ha ##ha [SEP]
1	[CLS] We are loyal Fair ##mont customers so of course we had to try the Fair ##mont Chicago ! From the minute we walked in we were treated like family . We had an issue with our suite being too close to the elevators and they provided us new rooms that were super quiet and perfect . We loved being in a Fair ##mont Gold room - what a nice treat that included breakfast , happy hour snack ##s , and dessert too in the VIP lounge . It was our anniversary and the management sent up champagne ! Also , Shea ( from the Columbus Ta ##p Restaurant on property ) was super sweet and sent up a beautiful plate of chocolate covered straw ##berries . Over and above for someone we just met . Hopefully our travels will take us back to the Fair ##mont Chicago ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a 3 day conference . The room was very spacious and I had a view of the river which was pretty awesome . I love the location of this hotel . It ' s central ##ly located and easy to get to all the well know attractions in Chicago . The only small grip ##e I had about my room was it was right by the elevator . I can here the elevator go up and down in the middle of the night . Other than that , this hotel is great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Keys stopped working constantly and I lost my patience at 4 ##am when had to wake my husband to get in . 2 + days for multiple items left in hallway ##s like tray ##s or glasses . Great location to parks and friendly staff but no one ever solved the key issues . Super ##visor gave me com ##p meal to alleviate my frustration somewhat . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for a shopping trip during Christmas . Hotel was very clean and everyone was very nice . Room is small but we were only in to sleep . Had a drink at the bar before retiring for the night and bartender was very friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great little spot NO ##T on Michigan Ave . Sometimes it is great to stay off the main drag . . . and this is the spot . You can walk to tons of restaurants and shopping . The v ##alet parking is expensive , $ 65 a day ! So be prepared . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great location . Staff was friendly and very helpful . Our room had a slight view of the river so that was nice . Lots of lobby areas to relax in and do work or people watch . We would stay here again when we visit Chicago [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing extraordinary , but a re ##lia ##bly solid hotel in a good location on the north side right off of Michigan Ave . Room was a little small ( beds were full size , I think , not queen ) , but plenty efficient for us . The bathroom has a sliding door , which doesn ' t provide a lot of privacy , but it was OK . The rates were very reasonable . The staff was polite . I would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We love the O ##m ##ni Hotel ! ! Best hotel in downtown Chicago ! ! Great staff and amazing location . The rooms are clean , comfortable and beautifully decorated . We wouldn ’ t stay anywhere else . My kids look forward to staying here every year . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We checked in early via online and everything was ready for us when we got there . Room was nice and newly renovated . Pool and spa area was disappointing . Pool was green and hot tub water was too low for jets to work properly . We did advise those in charge of spa and they did phone the problem in . Work ##out room needs up ##dating . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great night at the Kim ##pton . I ’ d like to thank , Dion and Alexandra at the front . They were very friendly and made both check in and check out a breeze . I ’ d also like to thank the staff for the excellent recommendations for breakfast , lunch and dinner . The location is perfectly located for the best of the River ##walk and Big Bus tours . The attached restaurant was very good as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed at this hotel while on a business trip . There was a system upgrade prior to our arrival ; during that transition our reservation was lost . However , we provided the confirmation number and the reception ##ist was able to get us into a room immediately ( early check - in ; we arrived just before noon ) , and she also upgraded us to a nice ##r room for the trouble . They were also very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting as far as allowing us a later check ##out time without charging us extra . Room service was very quick and professional , however the prices for in - room dining are quite high . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All the staff was great and very helpful . The hotel was very nice and right in the middle of everything that we wanted to do . The few times we needed a taxi , the door staff was very helpful in making that happen . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Came into the city to celebrate granddaughter birthday . Dec ##ided to spend night . Location was great . Room was very clean and comfortable . Staff was very friendly . Jeremy was very helpful and pleasant ! Pool area was clean and had nice view on 19th floor . Breakfast was standard and ok . Evening social was a little disappointing compare to other hotel we have stayed , but was still ok . We drove in and used the v ##alet parking , attendant was not very helpful or friendly . Would definitely stay here again , if back in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel in wonderful Chicago . Great location for sights ##ee ##ing , shopping and dining . Warm friendly staff who provide assistance promptly . We fell in love with Chicago and will definitely return and stay at The O ##m ##ni . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with my husband for the weekend and the room we booked was too small to a ##cco ##mo ##date two massage tables . Travis at the front desk ass ##ited us in finding a larger room at no additional cost that met our needs and booked a same day massage for me . notice ##ably pregnant he was even able to find a massage therapist who does pre - na ##tal massage ##s . Would def ##inate ##ly stay again and re ##cco ##men ##d to friends and family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We wanted a place Central to everything . The She ##rato ##n is it . The hop on hop off bus stops across road . It ' s only a block to the main downtown area . Right across the street is a Whole Food supermarket with everything you could wish for to eat in your own room ! Downs ##tai ##rs at the She ##rato ##n is a lovely eat in or take away cafe with views across the river . Next door is the best old English pub with genuine English food - which as Australians we really enjoyed . Only 5 minute bus ride to Lake Michigan . Would highly recommend this hotel . Staff helpful , rooms good size and even a Star ##bu ##cks that operates till 4 ##pm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love staying at Ambassador Chicago over the holidays . Hotel is decorated with a beautiful tree in the lobby . Warm fire in the library is always inviting . Room ##s are clean and comfortable . Staff is welcoming and ready to please . Easy to walk to food and shopping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] At 4 : 00 AM I awoke to find an in ##truder in my room with a flashlight going through my personal belongings . After contact ##ing the front desk , security came to my room immediately . Later the same morning during a conversation with Risk Management , they commented the hotels in the area are aware of non - registered guests entering the hotel and going floor to floor pushing on doors that are not secure ##ly la ##tched and entering them with the intent to steal . Perhaps a restriction to the elevators that allows only registered guests to access hem may provide greater security . The Director Of Guest Services did provide a v ##ou ##cher for a weekend stay ( black outs apply ) after we sought him out two days after the [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was placed in a room near ice maker to change rooms was challenging and upon my room move , was placed in a room where the shower liner wasn ’ t replaced , it had another persons hair and s ##have cream stuck on it ( how disgusting ) ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Michael O ' Day , one of the many v ##alet workers at this hotel , was fantastic . He was very professional and polite , helped us with our bags , asked about our lives , and made us feel like we were the most important people there . There was a line and others were waiting , but we did not feel rushed and he was really excited to help us . Even if the hotel and associated items weren ' t the best , this man made a great impression . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent experience and wonderful hotel ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I had a wonderful time and would re ##vis ##it again this months ! Beautiful hotel and view from my Ju ##ino ##r suite ! And the restaurant was amazing as well ! Wonderful hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The con ##cier ##ge on dining tips was great and the fitness instructor was able to provide personal instruction and was truly dedicated to her field . the room service was very good and time ##ly . The furniture was worn and ready for replacement [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed 4 nights in June 2018 while attending SH ##R ##M ##18 Chicago . The hotel was beautiful ! My room had an amazing view that faced the pier / lake as well as far north downtown . It was in walking distance to many neat at ##tar ##ctions and dining . The marble spa styled bathroom included was amazing ! There is not a pool on site , and parking is undergo ##und , but i would definitely return . I had the best time , and did not want to leave ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff at the front desk was always warm , welcoming , and friendly . One morning the light in our bathroom . We stopped at the front desk on our way to breakfast to let them know . By the time we were done eating , the situation was resolved . Like everyone else said , the window seats are a great spot to people watch Overall , the room was large and comfortable . Breakfast at the restaurant downstairs was great . The hotel is convenient ##ly located near a lot of attractions and the train . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We or ##dina ##rily lovely Kim ##pton Hotels and had stayed at the Monaco in Chicago several times , although not in the past five years . It ' s a great location . The room was pleasant and clean , but very noisy . We faced W ##aba ##sh Avenue and heard the El day and night and there was a baby in the next room whose crying was audible . Also , house ##keeping did not come to make up our room on Saturday until 4 p . m . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wait ##ed in line to check in for 45 minutes . We were told that their computer system was running slow and that it kept crashing . Our friends said they had a similar experience a month ago . While settling into our room , another guest entered our room . We attempted to contact the front desk , but were unable to get through . When we came back to our room , our keys had been de ##activated . I was then told to wait in the check in line again . This time that wait was an hour . We have stayed at this property many times in the past . Have reservations in Feb , but considering staying elsewhere . Sorry , the drink coup ##on did not make up for the a ##gg ##ra ##vation . Be ##ware . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed our stay at the Fair ##mont . It is located in a very central spot , near Michigan Avenue and right across from Mill ##eni ##um Park . Staff was friendly and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting when we asked for an early check in . Room are spacious , beds are comfortable and toilet ##ries are high quality . My only two suggestions : # 1 Breakfast should be included for all rooms , I think the price of the hotel merits a nice breakfast . # 2 I was annoyed by room service knocking on my door at 8 ##am to make the room ; granted I forgot to hang the privacy tag on the door but 8 ##am is a bit too early to bother guests . Other than that . . it was a very nice hotel and we would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , great location . From the curb ##side onwards the service is superb . Room ##s are comfortable , clean and wonderful beds . There is a convenient taxi rank right outside , bars , restaurants and shopping within a few blocks . The con ##cier ##ge service was extremely help and friendly , with a special nod to Peter and O ##s ##bal ##do . Full of information . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff for the most part were friendly . Room was clean except there was a stain on the comfort ##er . . . we asked them to change it but they never did . When we were leaving , we told the front desk about it and the woman seemed un ##int ##ere ##sted . . . so , other than that incident the stay was ok . I probably would not stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a much needed one - night re ##sp ##ite for me and my wife after a stress ##ful year . We had a beautiful two double bed executive suite . Room was clean . Beautiful view of the city , river and lake . Great service despite lock ##down . Everyone was as nice and as helpful as possible . Two points to make it even better . Off ##er the full food menu from Palm ##s for in - room din ##ning . In - room din ##ning menu was limited . More items available at Palm ##s . Also , the walk - in shower near the entry ##way had a bad stain on the floor . I normally wouldn ’ t mind and I ’ m sure the shower was clean , but it gave the appearance that was not clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really a very nice hotel . Room ##s very clean with a nice view of Chicago . A ##bility to buy daily pass to beautiful gym one block away was great . The fact that guests need to pay more for W ##i ##F ##i internet access is not acceptable for a hotel of this caliber . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My family had the opportunity to be guess if this wonderful hotel . The rooms are spacious and clean . The location is great . But the best thing about the hotel is the staff . Every staff member we encountered went out of their way to make us feel welcome . Special shout out to Than . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Having stayed in a few different So ##fit ##el a ##cc ##ross the planet i won ’ t say it is the best one of all but it is fine , meeting So ##fit ##el standards overall and what you can expect from such a luxury hotel chain . Standard Room ##s are pretty basic in terms of decoration ( though colour ##ful ) and some with a parking view ( that was my case ) . The good point is the bathroom , which is pretty nice and large . Good value for money if you manage a good package deal . Otherwise I would say there are better options . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I travel 3 weeks per month and stay in hotels all over the country . I can honestly say this was the nice ##st Hilton property I ' ve ever visited and would highly recommend to anyone . The rooftop bar is sensation ##al , the breakfast was excellent , and the room was fantastic in every detail . Most comfortable hotel bed in recent memory ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very con ##vie ##nt to Michigan Ave and all the major sites . We were beyond pleased when we were able to check in at noon . The staff at check in were very warm and friendly . Nice to provide a bag of ice for our stay . Our room was very clean and comfortable . Odd , only one remote for 2 TV ##s but we made it work . There was a little noise from the hall , could be better sound ##proof ##ed . Pool was spot ##less and nice . P ##lent ##y of towels . No hot tub . Breakfast looked nice , but we went out . There was a store but only S ##p ##rite . No diet soft drinks . Would stay again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at many hotels in Chicago for business over nearly fourth years and my wife and I have stayed at a few for pleasure , as well . This trip was to celebrate my wife ’ s milestone birthday and completion of cancer treatments . A friend strongly recommended The So ##fit ##el and could not have overs ##old it . We ’ ve never been treated like we were royalty to this degree in Chicago or anywhere else . The room was magnificent with spectacular views of the city . Once darkness fell , we enjoyed leaving off the room lights and watching the city view . Special thanks to Bernard and Ana . If there ’ s a seven - star hotel anywhere , Chicago So ##fit ##el is it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a weekend get away with our girls for the Christmas holiday . Hotel is in a great location . . . easy to walk almost anywhere . Hotel staff was not very friendly and room was very average and needed some repairs . I expected more given the cost , but I wanted it to be a special weekend . I thought with the higher price and the O ##m ##ni name that the room would be very nice . We were in the room very little during our stay so at the least the location was good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , with wonderful ##ly comfortable , well appointed rooms . Friendly staff is an important first line , and they did well . I could not help but over ##hea ##r a situation to the left of me as the guest was irrational ##ly demanding and the desk agent remained calm and kind , free from what could have easily become a con ##des ##cend ##ing response . The room was paid for as an incentive by my husband ' s employer , so I cannot comment on the cost / value . If reasonable , I would stay here the next time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved this hotel . It is an older property , with all the charm and architectural details missing from newer facilities . The lobby and our room were clean , beautifully appointed , and had everything we needed . The bed and bed ##ding were high quality . Nice bathroom with flu ##ffy towels and good shower . Friendly , helpful staff . Great location , just down the street from Michigan Avenue , and a few blocks from Water Tower Mall , if you ' re looking to shop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a nice hotel . It was clean , the staff was court ##eous and friendly . The location is good for shopping , restaurants , walking distance of br ##ew ##eries , Second City and Chicago Museum . Only one elevator was functioning so it was a bit difficult to get an elevator . The stay included a courtesy beverage in their lounge . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a convention at the Hilton Chicago and it was a great experience . But the top of it was Lola who made our o ##mel ##ets every morning ! She is very professional and she has a great personality . Lola was also very entertaining and extremely nice ! Thank you Hilton ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] All the employees are very friendly and helpful and the cleaning ladies do their best to make you feel invited . However , the hotel doesn ' t offer many amenities . It doesn ' t offer breakfast , unless you pay for it . There ' s no pool . I ' ve got to my room after a long flight and the only bottle of water was $ 10 ! ( just because it was in a fancy bottle ) . For the money , I would chose next time another hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Co ##m ##fy Bed ##s . . . Yes please ! Check ! Clean rooms . . . Yes please ! Check ! Nice Show ##er . . . Yes please ! Check ! Free Breakfast . . . Yes please ! Double check ! Yu ##p , this ones a keeper ! Co ##m ##fy , clean , p ##amp ##ered ! They even have a nice simple breakfast area on every single floor ! Talk about con ##ven ##ie ##ce ! Made my mornings easy ! Would definitely return to this hotel ! Only Su ##gg ##est ##ions . . Light ##ing in bathroom ##s need be a bit brighter for your female guests ! Check - in area needs re ##va ##mp ##ing all together ( location & wait time ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] I wanted to plan a weekend for my wife ' s birthday . I had decided Fleetwood Mac at the United Center would be a great night . We have stayed at the Talbot ##t Hotel before . It has been red ##one since the last time we were there . It is convenient ##ly located to Michigan Ave . Old Town and Near North destinations are within walking distance if the weather is good . The staff are always a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful . All the people are helpful with luggage , getting cab ##s , and advice . D ##wayne has a personality that ex ##udes welcome . We had a great week end , wonderful room , great restaurants , and Fleetwood Mac was fun . Amtrak makes Chicago downtown easy for us to hit the big city and get back to the sticks where we belong . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Charge a fortune for the room , then charge for internet on top of the room , staff that initially claimed there was no reservation , can hear other guests through the walls . Te ##rrible experience in a city with lots of better options . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hilton Chicago is a great value and in a prime South Loop location . It ' s very loud , very large , and very busy though , so best to come here if you are a tourist looking for the q ##uin ##tes ##sent ##ial Chicago experience and not a quiet weekend visiting friends or family . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The customer service was wonderful . The room was nice . The hotel was located in a great part of town . We had a wonderful time . I would definitely stay there again . Only down ##side is it is a bit price ##y but probably on average with other hotels in Chicago ’ s downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at the Conrad for our anniversary . It ' s a fairly new property , the rooms are modern , large , and comfortable . They have a really nice roof top bar and the staff is professional , at ##ten ##tive , and made our stay a great experience . The room rates compared to other similar properties is a great value . It is convenient to the Ma ##g Mile shopping area , the lake front , and great restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel has a great happy hour with complementary drinks and app ##eti ##zers ! Service is great and rooms are beautifully appointed ! So modern and comfortable ! Great location close to River and walk ##able ! ! Also breakfast is included and easily available . Best value around ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location of the hotel is very convenient and close to Michigan Ave as well as W ##rig ##ley Field . All staff members are extremely friendly and the con ##cier ##ge has helpful tips on sites to see and how to use public transportation . Do not forget to ask them about the Di ##v ##vy bike rental ##s - very convenient and inexpensive . We rented the bikes for a wonderful bike ride along the lakes ##hore and lunch along the way . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , location , location . At the Miracle Mile , walking distance to the Pier and to the River Walk . Room ##s are luxury - level , restaurant and food are excellent . Service is top - notch . Can ' t go wrong staying here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I loved staying at the Palmer House ! it ' s class ##y and very comfortable . I especially liked the con ##cier ##ge level . If you are coming for Unified ##s auditions , stay there . The lobby is comfortable , and the staff is very nice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I truly enjoy staying at this fine hotel in the heart of Chicago ’ s most distinct area . The staff is always so professional and friendly . The rooms and facilities always clean , fresh and modern . I love this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice clean room , great bar / restaurant on location , easy to access room . Great location downtown . Second time I stayed here and it was awesome both times . I had no problems . Would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very helpful staff , very well kept property from the lobby to the room . Has a very good city location and if you need directions all the staff are well ##ing to help . Ask for a room over looking the river . Bed ##s were very comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a truly nice hotel - - traditional , but with contemporary touches . Public spaces are beautiful , and our room was pleasant , clean and comfortable with excellent beds . Chicago Burger Co . on the River ##walk is an incredible asset . Paula , our con ##cier ##ge , was so helpful : she scored special tickets , suggested activities , restaurants and so much more . She really knows her way around Chicago . We loved the She ##rato ##n Grand . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were at the convention on Friday ( 12 ) & ( 13 ) Saturday it was a lovely experience to see the cu ##bs . But on Friday night the speakers were hanging vertically down in front of the screens so no one in the back could hardly see anything . You might want to consider that the speakers should hang ho ##riz ##ant ##ally instead of vertical because the cu ##bs came in from the left and another screen on the far right hand side of the auditorium so people on that side can see the screen . We did not stay at the hotel for the convention . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great service and great value . Friendly staff is the key ! Good accommodation ##s . Not enough amenities but good enough . Nice location . Great American breakfast . I ' d stay here again . Bar was nice and prices were fair . De ##pen ##da ##ble location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently stayed overnight at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Wonderful stay . Staff was very friendly and helpful during my stay . Only draw ##back was that Michael Jordan ' s restaurant was temporarily closed so I didn ' t get to eat there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the hotel for a week and had a great time . The staff was great , and the room was spot ##less and spacious . Our room didn ' t have a river view , but I think it might have been worth it to upgrade . Maybe next time ! The hotel could not be in a better location . It was a quick walk to Millennium Park , the Art Institute , and the shops on Michigan Ave . There was an L station close by for any trips out of walking distance . We were car ##less for the week and had no issues getting around . The hotel restaurant is worth a visit . We had br ##unch one morning and dinner one night . Both times were great . Try the apple blue ##berry crisp dessert . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bed ##ding ( du ##vet ) was filthy , full of stain ##s and clearly had not been changed in a while . This really surprised me as I have stayed here before and always thought highly of this property . When asked reception to get me a clean one , she suggested ( with a really bad attitude ) that I leave the dirty one outside my door and “ someone ” would bring a clean one . Eventually the house ##keeping supervisor ( a very nice lady ) came and sorted out the bed ##ding and brought fresh linen . I stay here because my company books me here , otherwise this would not be my choice of hotel when I ’ m Chicago . It is a shame because I like the area where it is located and in previous stays I have enjoyed my visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Hotel Monaco in connection with a business meeting held at the hotel . Check in was a breeze . The lobby is really nice with a lot of sitting places . My room and bathroom were very nice . The one draw ##back is no coffee maker in the room . You can get tea and coffee just off the lobby even in your bath robe . Breakfast is served at the Fi ##sk & Co . restaurant in the hotel with limited , but adequate choices . The meeting room was very quiet and set up to our satisfaction . We had a very good lunch served by b ##uff ##et in our meeting space . The attendant was at ##tun ##ed to our needs . The Monaco is just across the bridge from Michigan Avenue ' s miracle mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my 2nd time visiting my hotel , since it left a lasting impression during my first visit . From check - in to check - out , everyone and everything was fantastic . As an A ##cco ##r Member , I was greeted pleasant ##ly by staff and the check - in process took less than 2 minutes . I was also given compliment ##ary cocktail ##s at the bar . Since my last visit , the hotel and bar had been renovated and the place looked spectacular . The room was spacious and clean ; the mattress and pillows were like heaven . The location can ' t be beat . It is in the middle of everything , without the c ##raz ##iness of Michigan avenue . I will definitely be back upon my next trip to Chicago . Bravo to the staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we stay outs ##ait ##e from house , this is our second house , all services is perfect , remember this beautiful ##l place , and you have br ##unch options , full complete services included , the workers , help you t ##i have a nice experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel Monaco is our favorite Hotel in Chicago . We have stayed at others overs the years , but now we travel with our two mini - Au ##ssie ##s . Hotel Monaco has never disappointed . A small bout ##ique hotel in a great location just off the river . Free wine tasting ##s over Happy Hour . We park 2 blocks south for $ 41 / 24 hours [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is the first time we stayed at a Kim ##pton property . We loved it . Classic hotel with modern rooms , in a great location in downtown Chicago , clean rooms , friendly staff and good drinks ! We would stay at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont is clean and its service is crisp , but it does not live up to the Fair ##mont standards of its other properties . The Fair ##mont in San Francisco , for instance , makes its Chicago sister property look like a Holiday Inn . Still , it ' s a very nice hotel and it ' s in a great location . Big ##ges ##t down ##side ##s were its limited dining choices ( no fine dining ) and horrible wine selection in the lobby bar , restaurant and even in the Gold Club . I walked across the street and bought better wine at C ##VS than the Fair ##mont offered . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a great experience here ! The location was pre ##fect . Jesus , Ken ##dale , Man ##al , Manny , Jeremy , and Gabe were outstanding . They were very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I definitely will be coming back again . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I spent a couple of nights at the Talbot ##t Hotel . The staff were amazing . They were kind enough to upgrade our room , give us 4 drink v ##ou ##chers and $ 40 in coup ##ons to use for drinks or food in there restaurant . Hands down by far the best hotel experience we have ever had . Thank you Talbot ##t staff for making our stay so wonderful . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel and friendly staff . Very helpful and knowledge ##able staff . Check ##ing in and checking out was very easy . Vale ##t guys were helpful and very polite . Vale ##t and luggage staff were amazing and helpful [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here last week for spring break . Room was large and amenities were great . Breakfast in the hotel was very ta ##sty . Location in street ##er ##ville made it an easy walk to all of the sites we wanted to see or a quick U ##ber ride . Would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel in a great location for seeing the city ! ! ! Warm greeting from the front desk . . Outstanding room and amenities . Evening social hour with A ##per ##ol S ##p ##ritz . Quiet room and super com ##fy king sized bed . Overall great experience ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great pricing on hotel room . Room was clean . Very friendly staff . Would have liked a full length mirror in the room . Would have also liked a continental breakfast , or at least a cheaper breakfast option . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a business trip . For the price I wasn ’ t blown away having better experiences elsewhere . That said it ’ s a very nice property . Det ##rac ##tors include not having a fridge in the room for my things . I could wait at the front desk again and ask for one . But don ’ t you think for the price that the room would have this feature or be offered at check ##in ? Nice views and nice location . Very helpful and friendly staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my second time staying at this hotel . I got upgraded to a corner suite which was very spacious , consisted of huge Bed ##room , living room with a din ##ning area , one full bathroom and a half bathroom . Modern hotel , clean , great location for a tourist . The restaurant in the 20th floor next to the reception the food was delicious and the service was great the staff are helpful and friendly . I ' ll stay there again [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first stay at the Palmer House and I will certainly return . The lobby was so elegant and beautiful . Staff was very helpful and polite . I was staying here for a conference and so convenient to rooms and conference area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at the Talbot ##t for 4 nights , to celebrate our 5th year wedding anniversary . When the front desk staff learned of our celebration they sent us a compliment ##ary bottle of champagne on ice with a very sweet note of well wishes . This gesture may seem small to some , but for us it meant the world . It is rare that we are treated with such kindness and acceptance , not just tolerance . This was such a treat for us and we ’ d like to thank Joshua , the ( very s ##ty ##lish ) gentleman at the front desk who we are sure helped arrange this gene ##ros ##ity . The de ##cor is so elegant and inviting throughout the hotel , the linen ##s are l ##uxe and very clean . The staff were all very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We will definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful , clean hotel . Con ##cier ##ge available . One star de ##ducted as check in is te ##dious and a line of people looking tired visible - and no available luggage rack ##s . However , this hotel has all the Am ##eni ##ties you would ever need . Best is the 8th Floor full - service gym with walking track and a 3 - lane swim pool and 2 hot spa ##s . Mass ##ages app ##ts are available . Super sweet outdoor deck with all you ’ ll need to catch some rays or simply dry off . [SEP]

He was professional and friendly , making us feel important on our special day . The room was perfect and he even called to make sure we had everything that we needed . We have stayed at the Millennium 2 times before ( Valentine ' s Day and for my birthday ) , but this was the best because of K ##wa ##me ' s excellent customer service . Thank you K ##wa ##me ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had the opportunity to upgrade to the Gold Level Club prior to arriving . Mu ##gi the con ##cier ##ge was absolutely amazing from the moment I called to upgrade . He offered to provide us an early check in IF available , made us dinner reservations prior to arriving and truly made our experience amazing . In today ’ s world of hospitality employees , it ’ s rare to find an above and beyond employee such as Mu ##gi . We greatly appreciated your above and beyond can do attitude . [SEP]

1	[CLS] The hotel is situated middle in downtown . quick access to nice sights ##ee ##ing trips and to Michigan Avenue for shopping . The hotel itself is more an old style and has small rooms but nicely updated . S ##lid ##ing door to the bath is not optimal but efficient due to lack of place . Service is very helpful and a good quality served breakfast . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni Chicago hotel was a nicely situated hotel in Chicago it was our first stay at this hotel and whenever I return to Chicago I would stay there again and would recommend this hotel as well . the v ##alet parking was a little price ##y but well organized and efficient [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed here at least 3 times with different family members . High ##lights are the compliment ##ary breakfast and evening social and the spacious ##ness of the suites . The suites have been re ##mo ##del ##ed since my last stay . The location and view is te ##rri ##fic . I used the swimming pool I believe for the first time on this trip and was happy to see families using it . The water temperature was just right . I will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hotel have a very good location and you get what you expect . We had ##e breakfast two times at the Hotel ( 25 $ / person ) and it was a nice and well tasting experience . Our 26 year daughter stayed with us at the beds ##of ##a and it worked perfectly and it helped that it was more like a do ##ob ##ler ##oom : ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for near north side ( W ##rig ##ley / Lincoln Park Zoo Area ) to the north of the hotel and Downtown Chicago / Michigan Avenue directly to the south of the hotel . If you like to walk , all the above mentioned are walk ##able [SEP]
1	[CLS] i stayed here with my wife and daughter for one night to get to an appointment at the consul ##ate nearby . The location is perfect walking distance from the consul ##ate and lots of options for restaurants nearby . Also the suites come with a full kit ##ched with all the amenities and are decent sized for family with a child . Absolutely no parking on site , but there are a few parking structures near the building . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I can ’ t even begin on how clean and nice these rooms were . The hotel is in a great spot that is within walking distance of almost everything , including the Navy Pier . We stayed here with our 6 year old and 4 month old . When we parked our vehicle , we didn ’ t even get back in it until we pulled out . This was a great and memorable Chicago experience for our family ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a large trade show because it ’ s convenient ##ly located to many restaurants and other places I needed to be . In true Kim ##pton form , the property was well - appointed and exceptionally clean . And the staff was wonderful . Despite a contract dispute with the house ##keeping union ( which affected many other hotels around the city ) , they were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I was only in for 2 nights so didn ’ t really mind making my own bed , and they readily offered to provide clean towels . As is the case In most urban hotels , the bathroom was very small , but they made the most of the available space . The work desk was fine for my needs and there were plenty of outlets for charging devices . I ’ d definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] the location is ideal , close to the ma ##gni ##fi ##s ##cie ##nt mile nice neighbourhood , relatively quiet for downtown area close to rest ##aut ##ants , grocery store just around the corner i w ##oo ##uld go back at this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here last week for a business meeting - - beautiful hotel with a nice lobby and adequate ( small , but city - sized ) rooms . The food service and presentation was excellent . Having forgotten to bring my toilet ##ry kit , I was lucky enough to have Rachel R . at the front desk , who provided me with all that I needed at check - in . Good location - - would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed one night . We enjoyed our visit . Everyone was very court ##eous . The room we stayed in was a one bed king room on a corner with windows facing both Erie and Michigan Avenue ##s . The views were nice . You can hear some street noise such as ambulance ##s . Northwestern Memorial Hospital is just down the street . It is quiet ##er at night . There are electronic blind ##s and shear ##s . The only small b ##lem ##ish is there was a small brown stain on the bed covering which I folded down . Hopefully all the bed ##ding is washed and replaced for each guest . When we arrived in our room there was a complementary bottle of champagne in for our anniversary which was a nice touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our Company and Custom ##ers had a great time attending Rock ##well Auto ##mation Fair at the McCormick Center . The Hotel and Staff made our stay more enjoyable and relaxing during the two day event . Looking forward to another Chicago trip and staying at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is located on a tree lined street , it feels very residential and relaxing . However , there are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance . Our room was sufficient , the carpet was plus ##h , the lighting was fun and the TV was big . Park ##ing cost $ 67 for the night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great food and room service . All service very efficient and kind . Very clean hotel all around . Love the design of the hotel rooms . Great privacy and very comfortable . Very convenient location to everything fun in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is worth the extra money . From location , to de ##cor , to service you will not be disappointed . A few extra points worth mentioning : the in - room massage is f ##abulous so do this if you are at all interested . The bar downstairs has very knowledge ##able bartender ##s - I have never had fresh g ##inger in my Moscow Mu ##le , but it was a revelation . Everything is clean , neat and under ##state ##dly elegant . Also , this hotel is a 2 block walk to Carmine ' s and also the Lu ##x Bar and G ##rill , both of which had f ##abulous food . Again , spend the extra money and really relax in this fantastic hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a pleasant 3 night stay at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker Chicago . The hotel is well located , a few steps from Michigan Avenue and all the high - end shops . Travel on Michigan Avenue is easy with many buses available - we used 147 on a few occasions to get to the W ##rig ##ley building for a tour and to go further south to the public gardens - well worth a visit . Room 100 ##3 was quiet and well appointed , however , I noted , as we were leaving , prior to checking out , that the mini - bar fridge was not plug ##ged in - not really a problem for us - as we only used the fridge to cool chocolate and didn ' t notice the impact . . . We visited the Martin ##i Bar on two occasions and enjoyed the reasonably priced drinks and cocktail ##s . Would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed staying at this hotel very much . We were able to learn the history of the hotel and it was very neat ! You have to get a glance at the ballroom and hear the story of Hugh He ##ff ##ner and Al Cap ##one ' s cousin . Also , our room was very quiet , clean , and the bed was comfortable . The atmosphere is ups ##cale with a clever bar in the lobby . The location is very convenient to all the happening places with a short U ##ber ride or maybe you could walk . It was cold and snow ##ing when we stayed so we did not get to take advantage of the proximity to the park and water but hopefully next time . I recommend this hotel and will stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is beautiful historic hotel with touches of modern fl ##air . There is a TV in the mirror - something I had never seen ! Ta ##pas bar was good - but very price ##y . It is meant to be a place to l ##inger so do not go if you are in a hurry . Short walk to The Bean and The Mu ##s . of Fine Art . Room was a good size for older hotel and bathroom was modern . Great place to stay if you are going to a concert at Soldier Field - recommend walking there as traffic was a bear ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is very well located , close to the loop ( or even in the loop ) and few blocks away from the river front . The hotel is old and look old . The lobby is charming . My room was pretty small , especially the bathroom . You feel that the hotel tries to keep up but it is up to the modern standard My room gave on a small courtyard which was equivalent to facing a wall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We got a great rate so we chose the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . We often travel to Chicago just for fun and choose different hotels for fun . This was an older , somewhat smaller venue . It is like many of the more historic hotels in town . Our check in was quick and efficient , our room was nice with corner view . It was not spacious but large enough for two . Our bed was great and the room te ##mp well controlled ( we are kind of pick ##y on that ) . The bar looked good but we didn ' t stop there . The location was very good for Michigan Ave and north side bars ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Updated old world hotel experience . I have been by this hotel many times but never stayed . A very pleasant surprise . The staff was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble and to top off the stay , a Martin ##i bar . Well located near Water Tower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in the Hilton for just one night , after we ' d checked out in horror of Palmer House , and it could not have been more different . Check . in was pro ##ffe ##ssi ##oon ##al , covering all the bases and adding a personal touch , The room was huge , with two bathroom ##s and an incredibly beautiful view of Lake Michigan . Public transport was in easy re ##rac ##h and there were plenty of decent restaurants in the area , cheap as well as credit card killers . If I had known what to expect , I would have chosen this place for the entirety of our stay in Chicago . Next time , no doubt , this is where we will stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie was amazing . We stayed 3 days , our con ##cier ##ge Spencer was very friendly and quite knowledge ##able about the happening ##s in Chicago . He had some hook ups to assist us in food lines and gave us updates on where the best places for jazz and food . He even surprised us with a compliment ##ary champagne with a hand ##written letter of con ##gratulations . He made the Chicago experience sea ##m ##less and better . The room was on the 5th floor , we had a corner room that enabled us to see city views and the night lights . I will definitely return to the Ki ##nz ##ie . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very well located , polite staff , nice interior design , high speed w ##if ##i . . . why not 6 / 6 ? B ##fast prices too high + first check ##in , where other hotels will upgrade you , they offered me an upgrade for $ 15 a night . . . still I ll highly recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , perfect situated in the centre , walking distance of the Ma ##g . Mile . You will receive welcome drinks at the bar which is very nice . Room ##s are spot ##less clean and comfortable . I ##d would stay again next time [SEP]
1	[CLS] One elevator down for repair , that ' s fine , things . Second elevator stopped half way between floors . No protocols in place Staff told my daughter and all eight on elevator to jump , the worst thing you can do as elevator can shift and de - capita ##tion can follow . It ' s not if something goes wrong , it ' s what you do when it goes wrong . Management offer very shallow un ##p ##ro ##fe ##ssion ##al response [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly , Clean , Modern rooms of decent size . Good Value . W ##I ##ll stay there again . Trip advisor is forcing me to type more . . . Not sure what else someone would want to know . Weather in Chicago was awful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was planning a comb ##o trip to Chicago , part work , part play . I had a reservation for 3 nights elsewhere , on my own dim ##e , but I realized I failed to book a room for the work portion of my trip , on the front end . Most of my regular downtown hotels were booked up , but I found this place . I know why it was available . My $ 220 - 250 rate . . . don ' t recall exactly . . . is way high for what this is place is . The lobby and the exterior is nice . But there ' s only so much lipstick you can put on a place before it looks like a past - its - prime , run - down , tried - to - re ##f ##resh - it hotel . Book early , and book somewhere else . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful Hotel on the River . Love Kim ##pton Hotels they have such great features . Find the password on Facebook and you might get a couple of Free drinks in the Bar . The Room ##s have these great window seats that you can curl up on and watch the city . We usually get a great rate on up ##grading to Suite which has a great soaking tub for 2 and a living room in addition to the bedroom . We have stayed here 3 times now and it is our favorite Chicago Kim ##pton hotel . Great location within walking distance to lots of Chicago attractions ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Little and co ##zy hotel right in the middle of it all . Walking to Rush and Michigan . Great personal service . Nice gym facilities ( small but good ) . Room ##s big and comfortable . Great lobby bar and bell men . Full ##y recommended [SEP]
0	[CLS] Home ##wood Suite ##s b ##u Hilton was an excellent place to stay while in Chicago . There were complementary breakfast and evening snack ##s . The beds were comfortable . Everything in the kitchen worked . The towels were clean and the shower ##s most comfortable with warm water . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great atmosphere , excellent dining experience , and efficient and polite staff . Love ##ly area of Chicago to be staying in , and close to Michigan Ave . It is one of my favorite places to stay and din ##e in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Long story short , the place we had reserved fell through and we found ourselves in need of a hotel quickly . Nicole helped out my family with the kind ##est customer service and found a couple great rooms for our family at the Swiss ##ote ##l . She was very knowledge ##able about the area and shared some great tips about the hotel and surrounding area . We are so grateful for her help and hospitality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We wanted to stay at this hotel as we love to swim to get over jet la ##g and too much shopping ! The pool is beautiful and all fitness facilities are very good . The rooms are un ##att ##rac ##tive with small windows but serviced well and are very clean . The beds are extremely comfortable . Sad ##ly , the breakfast room and breakfast b ##uff ##et are simply not good enough for a hotel of this size . The choice of food is not wide and the room itself is crowded . Service is not brilliant either . We had to ask three times for some milk . Better breakfast ##s can be had nearby , and the Mar ##riot ##t provides a higher standard for less money . The lobby of this hotel needs renovation as it is very un ##att ##rac ##tive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice bout ##ique hotel in the theater district . Great location . Price ##y . Room ##s are on the small side but very nice and clean . Hotel has a restaurant and bar . Starr are very friendly and helpful . Would love to stay again on my next trip to Chicago ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room we selected was wonderful . We had a corner room on the 7th floor with a view of both Lake Michigan , the canal , and the city . The room and hotel were clean . The staff was friendly . The location is great . a couple of blocks in either direction and you are at Navy Pier or the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ( Michigan Ave . ) The only complaint I have is the parking , which was $ 60 a night . The value of the stay went down significantly when we added $ 60 a day to the hotel bill . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel . Room was very comfortable , clean , wide and charming . Good staff and very friendly . Perfect location , close to a lot of good places and easy to walk around . A lot of restaurants nearby . Good breakfast in each floor , different but it was good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I don ' t even want to spread the word , but we love this place , we are never disappointed . We stayed there when we bought our apartment , we put friends and family there . The hotel is clean , in a really good local ##e , and we love the bar & restaurant . N ##ei ##gh ##bor ##hood g ##em . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a ladies get away in a suite with a great view . The staff was amazing ##ly helpful with directions , room service and extra things we needed in our room . The hotel is in a great location , would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ever since my son and daughter moved to Chicago five years ago , I have been staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel when I visit . I just returned from my 13th visit there ! It ' s not just a hotel , but feels like my second home . The staff is wonderful , from the bell ##men to the housekeeper ##s , to the people at the front desk , ( " hi " to Drake and Gerry ) , to the bartender ##s at the incredible happy hour , the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is perfect in every way . The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel is located near great restaurants , shopping , Mill ##eni ##um Park , and is close to the trains as well ! I would also like to send a special thank you to Patti and Melissa ! Please stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel ! You will not be sorry . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had our annual leadership conference at the Fair ##mont this year . I was as ##to ##und ##ed by the g ##rac ##ious hospitality of the staff and management at the hotel . Despite the best efforts of Mother Nature and the polar v ##ortex , the Fair ##mont headed off all potential issues and helped us deal with travel delays and massive logistics issues during check in / out and other weather related mi ##sha ##ps . The food and beverage has been the best that we ’ ve ever had at a conference . And the rooms are quiet , warm , and quite modern . All in all , it has been excellent . Many thanks , Fair ##mont Chicago , for a wonderful conference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family of 5 plus a friend travelled to Chicago for a quick trip over President ' s Day Weekend . Our suite had a great view , plenty of space , and very clean . Inc ##luded in our package was a continental breakfast in the Gold Lounge on the 15th floor . Every morning we were greeted by Dolores ! Except ##ional worker , friendly , and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . In fact , all the staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful . We loved our stay and would definitely book again when we go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I just like to say that we absolutely love the She ##rato ##n Grand in Chicago ! ! We felt very cared for and treated with the u ##t ##most respect and kindness ! From the con ##cier ##ge Maris ##a who was a beautiful kind person to the front desk clerk ##s to the door ##man Mike . We felt we were in such good hands ! ! We would also like to recognize the taxi service arranged by Maris ##a . The taxi driver B ##umba was a wonderful respect ##ful driver who put our mind at ease on the road . We will definitely come back to this Hotel in the future and will highly recommend it to our family and friends ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very well located with easy access to shops , transport and places to eat . The Art Institute , Michigan Avenue , Mill ##eni ##um Park and the lake ##front are also easily accessible by walking . The hotel lobby is very ornate , with shops and a Star ##bu ##cks on the basement level . The view of the city and the lake from my room was great , but the room itself was small but very well appointed . The service was professional and friendly . I ’ d stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I were in Chicago for our anniversary . After seeing the reviews here , we decided to stay at the Kim ##pton ! What a great bout ##ique hotel ! All the employees were so helpful and nice . They even sent us an anniversary surprise up to our room ! We had a king room overlooking the river . The view here was wonderful ! Love ##d the window seat ! Sa ##t and had a glass of wine in the evening and a cup of coffee in the morning . The bed and pillows were so com ##fy . They provide coffee in the morning and ice water all day . The location was great as well ! Can ' t say enough good things about this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was very nice and the staff very helpful . One morning I found no s ##ham ##po ##o in the bath and another , cleaning staff had left a full trash ##can in the bath . Other than that everything was great . I had dinner at the Palm and that was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came to Chicago for a weekend trip and stayed here . We got a great weekend deal and it seemed to be in a good location . Upon arrival this is a very big hotel ! We were a little shocked , but staff were super friendly , room was great and location was perfect for our needs . While big we also loved the extra amenities that it had especially the market where we had some great lunch ##es . Would recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Our room was what I wish my room was like at home ! Everything from the window treatments to the bed ##ding to the funk ##y artwork . Having a night ##cap at the bar before we headed up to bed will add to the good memory of our night in Chicago . I will try to stay at the Talbot ##t again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was nice place to stay my room was on 26th floor so no noise which I enjoyed . They should have provided water free of charge with the money they were charging . Meeting rooms were freezing . But room was on 26 floor so it was not noisy . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a real class ##y place ! The room is huge , beds couldn ' t be better , nice bath ##robe ##s for the guests , very sophisticated de ##cor . Service is imp ##ec ##ca ##ble , and if you are willing to ride the metro , it is close to all major tourist attractions ( only 2 stops from the Loop ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] If I end up back in downtown Chicago , I will definitely consider staying at this hotel again . Interest ##ingly , the lobby is on the 20th floor - - but when I arrived at the ground floor entrance there was a representative to greet me immediately and send me promptly up to the lobby . The bar and restaurant had good food and craft cocktail ##s . The guest rooms are updated , with a sleek , modern feeling . Glad I found this property on one of the travel search engines ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had the chance to travel to Chicago this weekend - - my time at So ##fit ##el exceeded expectations . The hotel ' s style is an inter ##pol ##ation of the qualities of a luxury and a business hotel . Although I did notice a tiny bit of wear on the furniture in my hotel room , the service , clean ##liness , location ( and views ! ) were well worth the price . None other than a w ##hi ##ff of Her ##mes soap in the bathroom brought a splendid edge to my experience ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well located in the center of Chicago this historic hotel boasts a beautiful vaulted lobby with a sitting area , restaurant and bar . The rooms are comfortable but a bit dated . View ##s are hard to come by on the lower floors but possible with a corner room . Star ##bu ##cks in the lower level and several surrounding dining options . " L " station across the street makes getting to and from O ' Hare a simple feat ( about 40 ##m / 18 stops on the blue line ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here , for the second time in two years , August 2015 . The hotel is beautiful , very trend ##y lobby , fantastic local art , great staff . The room was very well appointed , com ##fy king bed , mini fridge and a separate couch . Clean , quiet and comfortable . There is no restaurant in the hotel but our room keys got us 20 % off the " Public House " next door , great pub with a really cool v ##ibe . Breakfast is available near the elevators every morning , continental fare , lots of choices and good quality . The location is great , Chicago is a walking city and you are in the heart of it all at the Ki ##nz ##ie . In closing , we will visit again some day and when we do we look forward to staying at the Ki ##nz ##ie ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service from getting our bags from our car , to check ##in , to check ##out was excellent . Very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Michael and Shane at the front desk helped get us a great room for our anniversary ! We had a great stay here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a nice stay at the Home ##wood suites . Our studio room really was 2 rooms with closet type doors between the living room and bedroom . It was clean and a nice size . We would stay here again . They ran out of pack n plays for our to ##ddler by the time we arrived Sunday night even though we called in advance to request one . We got him to sleep and luck ##ily the next day they had one available . Park ##ing is E ##X ##P ##EN ##SI ##VE but I think that is just a Chicago thing . It was very easy to get around . Walking was easy and a free troll ##y to Navy Pier stops right in front of the hotel . Breakfast was decent . The eggs weren ’ t good . But for a free breakfast it was ok . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was great and the service was excellent . The bar was fun with awesome happy your deals and interesting cocktail ##s . Bath ##room in the room was very large and comfortable . Location downtown is superb and easily walk ##able to many attractions . Will stay again . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Very impressed with the quality of everything at Chicago ’ s Swiss ##ote ##l on W ##ack ##er Drive , very convenient ##ly located to downtown , the Chicago River ##walk , Navy Pier , and Mill ##eni ##um Park . Very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff , especially at check - in and check - out . The room was clean and spacious , and for $ 25 we were able to upgrade to a room with a f ##abulous view of the Chicago River , Navy Pier , and Lake Michigan for our four night stay . The hotel itself was very active , and the lounge / bar and restaurant area on the lobby floor always seemed to be hop ##ping both day and night , making for a fun v ##ibe . Plus , they have an excellent gym on the 44 ##th floor that ’ s been recently renovated and features breath ##taking views of the city . The next time I visit Chicago , I ’ ll definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am blown away by the personal ##ized service given by the entire staff at Hotel Monaco . My husband wanted to add some personal touches to our room for my birthday and the staff took care of E ##VE ##R ##Y ##TH ##ING . I have never felt more welcomed , more appreciated as a hotel guest . I felt so special during my entire stay . The rooms were spot ##less and so elegant ##ly appointed with so much attention to detail . We L ##O ##VE ##D our corner room and sitting on the window seats , built for two , overlooking the Chicago river and sky ##scraper ##s . I can ' t say enough about our incredible stay . We are incredibly grateful for the entire staff for making our stay so memorable . . . you are truly appreciated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Quiet com ##fy rooms , wonderful ##ly at ##ten ##tive staff . Park ##ing fee was expected and in line with other hotels . Still not for budget conscious . Room ##s reasonably priced for location . Restaurant for breakfast was quite good . Leave hotel for dinner , though as no option seemed adequate . I ' d stay again because ok the location and comfortable rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly room . Excellent location . Pool is charming but needs ceiling repairs . El ##eva ##tors were too slow and the lobby was overwhelmed . Diego Te ##ks ##te made the stay extra special . He went the extra mile to welcome us and solved the issues we had . He is a keeper ! House ##keeping was friendly , professional and did a great job . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Classic Ambassador Hotel is back ! Great service all around , upgraded loft room , class ##y restaurant for breakfast and the best Gold Coast location . 2 blocks to Lincoln Park , 2 blocks to the Lake , the most beautiful historical residential neighborhood around the corner . Less than 10 minute walk to the bust ##le of downtown . Had ##n ’ t been here since the new owners took it back from the Public , this will be my go - to for all my Chicago visits . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would stay here again anytime ! We had a king room with a full kitchen and a pull out couch . The room seemed new or newly re ##mo ##del ##ed . It was all very clean . The breakfast included the next morning , was awesome , but it was crowded so come be prepared and go early if you want to beat the rush . The pool was a bit cold , no hot tub , but our kids still enjoyed it . The hotel is about a 1 . 5 blocks from Michigan Ave , tons of restaurants surround the location . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Was here for business , however in the current situation it was sad not to see all the normal staff at the hotel , especially the amazing door ##man . Room was very adequate apart from the iron spit ##ting out dirt on my shirt . Had the problem of only 2 pillows on the bed , this isn ' t normal and normally have 4 very large ones . Overall a good stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago for a quick conference . I honestly stayed there for the convenience as the conference was in the same hotel . I was pleasant ##ly surprised at the service . They allowed me to check in 6 hours early and check out one hour late . There wasn ' t a huge line up for check in and check out . The staff was brilliant and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The food was abundant and delicious . My room was clean and I could op ##t for a v ##ou ##cher instead of daily cleaning . All this and the hotel is very central ##ly located . I would definitely stay at the She ##rato ##n Grand again if I was to head back to Chicago . [SEP]

0	[CLS] We would certainly come back to this hotel . Next to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , beautiful rooms , nice de ##cor , friendly staff , touch of urban luxury without being too much . Maybe the breakfast service could include a b ##uff ##et but this is the only remark I could think of . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I enjoyed being here so much ! The lobby was beautiful and always bust ##ling with activity . The breakfast every morning and light snack ##s every evening were always enjoyable , and the staff was polite at all times . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I cannot say enough great things about this hotel . My daughter and I stayed for a short girls ' trip to the city and loved it . The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble - special compliment to the door ##man Michael and bell ##man ( I think his name was Jonathan ) . Both went out of their way for us - Jonathan made sure we had a gold ##fish in our room ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly a plus ! I always love Kim ##pton hotels and this was no exception - we will be back on our next trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked the American Girl package . The package was great but we aware , the charge is per day not per package . Yi ##kes . The hotel is fantastic ! Well appointed and well maintained . Location is perfect though the room is a little small . Lou ##d day and night with sire ##ns ( 2 blocks from hospital ) but worth the noise for the location . Food in the hotel restaurant is quite good though price ##y . Our kids slept on the pull out couch with no issues . En ##joy Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The All ##egro proved a pleasant surprise during my last visit to Chicago . I brought my team of 5 up for business meetings and we experienced a beautiful bout ##ique hotel with a tremendous staff . They were quick to serve us and took time to answer any questions we might have regarding all Chicago has to offer . One employee , R ##ubi ##e , stood out as she went out of her way to ensure my staff and I were satisfied . Her food suggestions turned out to be just what we wanted during our stay . Thanks All ##egro and Thanks R ##ubi ##e ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was not greeted when checking in and not given instructions on to get to my room or even where things are located in hotel . Was first time visiting this hotel and not very impressed have been treated better at Holiday Inn . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff at this hotel are always the reason I stay here . They are always warm and welcoming and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . The food is excellent and the location is right where you want to be . I have been staying here for years and will continue to do so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was in Chicago on business . I stay at a lot of O ##m ##nis . . . for a good reason - the staff . This hotel lived up to the typical O ##m ##ni high standard . I became ill the first morning . So ill that I physically couldn ' t get out of bed , but I needed to get some medication ( after contact ##ing my te ##led ##oc ! ) . After calling in the order , the bell ##man went several blocks to pick up my called in prescription . This was a life save ##r ! ! Thank you , Thank you ! ! As a single travel ##er alone on a business trip , this act made a huge difference to me . BT ##W - room was great ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] It is very nice luxury hotel . It is s ##ty ##list hotel that make u feeling nice . But parking downtown is crazy price . I recommend this hotel without car . We can walk around city without car . Clean ##ing is good . But i think reception should smile . Not like busy all times . That ' s all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This bout ##ique hotel is clean , well maintained , and a good deal overall . The staff is re ##sp ##ons ##ive and at ##ten ##tive . The Talbot ##t is the quiet ##est downtown Chicago hotel I ' ve ever stayed in ; no street noise , banging doors , or loud ice machines . Great location with easy access to all that Chicago has to offer . Be sure to familiar ##ize yourself with parking options during the reservation process , as parking is NO ##T free as indicated on the hotel ' s website . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s a lovely facility with a nice v ##ibe , but the service and details don ' t match the s ##ty ##lish ##ness , especially at this price point . Coffee not rest ##ock ##ed , no music available in the most expensive suite , room not available until E ##X ##AC ##TL ##Y 3 ##pm . . . all under ##w ##hel ##ming [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this hotel ! Great location , not far from Union Station . Beautiful rooms , helpful staff and an excellent on site restaurant . They even had an evening wine reception with good wines . I will definitely return on my next Chicago trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel . Clean rooms . Good rate . We used the 3rd floor meeting room for our conference . It was nice and lunch was good . Star Bucks in the lobby to start the day and also Potter ##s for a late night b ##urger or shake . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at the Talbot ##t . Staff were friendly and helpful - and we enjoyed the wonderful bout ##ique hotel located in the heart of Chicago ' s Gold Coast . We will definitely stay here again . The am ##bie ##nce was also excellent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a mini vacation with my fi ##an ##cé and we had a blast . This hotel is in the perfect location ! We took the L from Midway to State / Lake and the hotel is only a 4 block walk away from that stop . There are plenty of restaurants and cool bars in the surrounding blocks too . Hotel staff was extremely friendly . Our room was modern and so clean ! Bed is so comfortable and comes with a ton of pillows and a heavy , warm comfort ##er . Room also a Ke ##uri ##g , an i ##H ##ome , and a mini fridge which is awesome ! Breakfast is free with a huge variety of options . Every floor has their own breakfast spread and you are provided with a tray so you can s ##cu ##rry back to your room and enjoy breakfast in bed . It truly was an amazing stay . I highly recommend staying here ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We usually stay at the Trump while in Chicago and I wish I would have . The O ##m ##ni is old and dark and d ##rea ##ry . The room was clean but not charming at all - seemed out ##dated - staff was just so - so . We asked for water and never did get any . Nothing in the room that would be considered a great am ##eni ##ty except coffee . For the price of the room and ##ne ##hat the O ##m ##ni offers I would rather spend my hard earned dollars at the most luxurious hotel in Chicago . . . . the Trump [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##rem ##end ##ous central location , convenient to most of everything the city has to offer , surprisingly wonderful value for a great room on the 20th Floor with great view over Michigan Avenue and the river ( just ) The room of course was everything one would expect from a first class hotel . Wonderful Christmas decoration and charming staff great ##ed our arrival , with a very efficient check in , if in the city this must be a quality choice . [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment we arrive the staff was friendly and outgoing . The hotel is in a great location and the room was perfect for our stay . If possible , I will always stay at a Fair ##mont ! The Gold Lounge is a real treat . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very modern ( no buttons for elevator floors even ) . Conference facilities are great , beds are comfortable and the views are of the lake ! Would definitely stay here again . Great value for the $ [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed my stay . Hotel staff was very at ##ten ##tive . Room was a little on the small side , but nicely appointed . I would definitely stay here again as location cannot be beat as it is close to the Chicago River , shopping and restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] While checking in , my husband and I witness and interaction between a front desk clerk and a di ##s ##g ##run ##tled guest . He was being a complete jerk , slamming things down on the desk and calling the clerk out of her name . I think her name is Kay stayed calm and very respect ##ful , offering to help the guest solve his issue . Not once did she raise her voice or sound angry ( I was angry for her ) . She remained professional and friendly . My husband said he was going to offer her a job . We work in the public sector and we have never seen anyone handle that situation with such fines ##se . [SEP]
1	[CLS] On the second day our room was not cleaned adequately and the bathroom – which had been slow draining after a shower had several inches of dirty standing water . My sister took a shower anyway and we reported it and our request did result in someone fixing the draining problem and cleaning the tub . On the day before check ##out , our room was not cleaned at all and it took several contacts with staff to get clean towels and toilet paper . I had stayed at the Palmer House in the past but never again ! ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here back in October 2017 , as my husband was running the Chicago Marathon . The hotel was amazing ##ly central to downtown - just a short walk to the ma ##g mile and all of the shops / restaurants there , and then a pretty short walk to the other side of the river where the Chicago Theatre is , and also Millennium Park . The hotel is right on the river , which makes for a pretty view from your window if you ’ re that side of the hotel . Our room had everything we needed , including a fridge for drinks and snack ##s . Spa ##cious and perfect for us for a long weekend ! Staff were helpful and very friendly . Would definitely not hesitate to stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean & comfortable time here at the H ##ya ##tt Regency . The staff is super friendly & helpful . The city & river views are outstanding . I ' d definitely recommend staying here the next time you are in Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay was great . I always use the hotel in ch ##ica ##go for proximity , clean ##liness , facilities and staff are all great . I use for personal and for pleasure . I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to stay in ch ##ica ##go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I brought my boyfriend to Chicago for his 30th birthday and chose the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker as our hotel . I liked it and so did he . The con ##cier ##ge at the front desk was really inform ##ative and they even held on to our luggage on our last day so we didn ' t have to run around with it on us . Also I loved the older feel of the hotel , which was especially awesome with the jazz band playing in the lobby at night . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] thoroughly enjoyed our stay . Very friendly staff . Love ##d the location . The restaurant had a wonderful view and when we checked in they gave our 7 y ##r old grandson a little stuffed animal which he loved . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After reading the reviews I was really excited for this hotel . The staff is amazing ##ly kind , helpful and friendly . This hotel allows pets . . you can smell them when you enter . Our first room looked at a cement c ##rumbling wall . We upgraded at a fee of $ 10 per night to look at a building with a screen . The city view room ( as they called it ) was loud all night with traffic . The breakfast was good , convenient and easy . The room was really clean . Great staff . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about our stay was great . The location allowed us to walk everywhere including the Art Institute and Navy Pier . It is a bit further to the museum campus but would be do ##able . The rooms were big and modern . We loved having breakfast on each floor . Our room was right off the elevator lobby and we never heard people coming or going or the staff setting up the breakfast . The evening reception was a great transition to evening activities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Called service twice and requests were ignored for soap and blankets , our door wouldn ' t shut properly , the toilet was loose and rocked around , the bed had no blanket so we covered with mattress protector , sheet and end of bed protector , no soap was provided , E ##LE ##VA ##TO ##RS W ##ER ##E A Q ##UE ##UE N ##IG ##HT ##MA ##RE , constant marijuana smell that staff didn ' t stop after reporting , food was ta ##sty and cafe service good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Hotel is very clean and beds are comfortable . Room is designed with plenty of room for luggage , bathroom counter space , etc . Staff quickly responds to room service requests . Would definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] World Class Hotel in a World class city ! Make sure you upgrade to the Gold , the staff is exceptional . We were walking distance from Mill ##eni ##um Park , the Navy Pier and the river walk ! The couples massage and spa amenities were exceptional . Too many things to do in two days , we will certainly return soon . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a good arrival experience from the guys in v ##alet to the front desk staff . Room ##s are decorated nice and the bathroom was clean and feels newer . The hotel has a great coffee set up in the morning . Hard to beat this hotel for the price . Co ##up ##le improvements : Front desk associate could not break a $ 100 bill . ( that ' s annoying for a travel ##er ) The desk staff could not present a list of pet friendly places like advertised on the website and the pet relief area across the street ( while it may not be yours ) was not much to be desired . The hotel should look into investing some of their resources into it as it is where your guests take their pets . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As I write these words I am kicking myself for not having previously stayed at Hotel Monaco . The rooms and hotel are beautifully appointed and s ##ty ##lish . Everyone was extremely friendly . My daughter flew in late on a Saturday evening , so we decided to just go across the street to the Emerald Loop for a drink and app ##eti ##zers . The door ##man greeted us , asked where we were going , and when we told him he handed us a coup ##on for a free app ##eti ##zer . The hotel visit was perfection , and this will be our " go to " hotel on future trips to Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first O ##m ##ni property I stayed at , and it made me a loyal customer . I have stayed here two more times and several other O ##m ##ni properties , and have compared them to other hotels in large cities . The O ##m ##ni organization is consistently great with excellent service . This property was no exception . Although I didn ' t part ##ake in the amenities of the hotel , you can read the other reviews to get an idea of the quality of these properties . I have yet to have more than a small ni ##t ##pic ##k of a complaint about any other O ##m ##ni property . Service is where this hotel ex ##cel ##s . S ##pen ##ding just a little bit more per night at the O ##m ##ni hotels where I visit makes me very glad I did . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , location , location . With this g ##em being right downtown Chicago you can ' t go wrong . It is within walking distance of so many nice restaurants and shops . The rooms are very nice appointed and the views ! The downtown lights at night are a spectacular thing to see , we even slept with our curtains open so we could see the lights . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always a pleasure to visit So ##fit ##el Chicago for my yearly trip to Neo ##C ##on . . . hotel is in a great location , close to the action on Rush St and is always operated at a high level , with excellent service . . . my go to hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A group of us get together every summer somewhere and this year it was Chicago . We chose the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker due to location . Great spot and even better hotel . Staff is at ##ten ##tive and outgoing . The rooms are great . Easy access to many great spots downtown Chicago by walking , bus , train , or cab . One of the best ##s spots to be to enjoy the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l for about $ 80 / night , and it felt like a luxury hotel . Honestly , not even sure how I got such a good deal . The entry ##way was lovely . The location right by the river and Michigan Ave . was perfect . [SEP]
0	[CLS] If you are looking for a place to stay with the family in a great location with exceptional service and a place to make great memories , look no further . I have never had a bad experience at any O ##m ##ni hotel , and could not have asked for anything more during any of my stays ! This is a must stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Get a great night sleep after enjoying the f ##abulous city of Chicago . V ##isi ##t the Bean ! ! ! The mattress was the best at the beautiful Chicago H ##ya ##tt Regency . The bell ##hop ##s were the most curious bell ##hop ##s ever ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was everything I desire in a hotel stay . Beautiful inside and out . Friendly and absolutely great a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . Michelle O . and Michael W . were wonderful about handling my last second requests . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the price , you can ' t beat these beautiful rooms . More like an apartment ( with separate bedroom , hide - a - bed in the living room and kitchen ) , than a hotel room . They have a pool , full breakfast self - serve b ##uff ##et . . . it was wonderful and very economical . I will DE ##FI ##NI ##TE ##L ##Y stay here again and recommend to my friends ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This beautiful old hotel is in a perfect location in the theater district . The front desk staff was helpful and it was easy to navigate . Free coffee and tea in the lobby on the second floor at check in ( note there is not a coffee maker in the room ) . The room itself is quite tight , but well appointed . You could see some wear and tear as everything is painted black and chip ##ped paint easily shows white underneath . Odd ##ly enough , it was quite even though the location is situated right next to the L . There is also a free manager ' s social hour night ##ly with prose ##cco ! There was an ice bucket in the room but I didn ' t find the ice machine . One tip for management , put the standard hotel book in the room so I don ' t have to call the front desk all the time for information ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stay here often when visiting Chicago . Very convenient and the rooms are nice . The staff are very friendly . the manager ' s reception is a bonus . The breakfast is good but not real extensive . Re ##com ##men ##d this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Hilton Chicago over Christmas week . The room was decent with normal Hilton amenities . We notified house ##keeping of a soil ##ed area and it was cleaned satisfactory that day . The history of the hotel is very interesting and makes the property a unique venue . The staff was helpful and pleasant . Our biggest issue is the poor W ##i ##F ##i . We log ##ged on to the Hilton Honors W ##i ##F ##i and the minute our phones would “ go to sleep ” we would lose the connection every time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are a little small , but that our only complaint . We stay here every year on the weekend before Thanksgiving for the lighting Parade . The location is P ##ER ##F ##EC ##T for shopping and for conventions . You can get anywhere you need to be quickly . Also , the staff is experienced and fantastic . We have seen many of the same people there every year , which tells us they must be treated pretty well and perform their jobs properly ! ! This is a great place to stay ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The idea of perfect customer service is Abdul Al ##bow at the front desk . Extreme ##ly professional and helpful ! Great job guys ! Room was extremely clean . Anything that we needed Abdul took care of it . Check in was extremely fast with no hi ##cc ##ups . I parked at a garage right down the street for the weekend that was within walking distance and reasonable prices . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I use this hotel for my boss ' travel to Chicago , which is frequent , as my first choice for her travels . If I have any revision ##s to dates , etc . , the in - house customer service team is always a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . I just worked with Kevin to re ##vise a date to earlier in the week and he actually got me a lower rate than I had on my original reservation . I appreciate that ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a conference here . Eddie at the bar offers great , friendly , customer service . Overall , the experience at the hotel has been great . View ##s of the river are fantastic . Bed ##s are comfortable , bathroom ##s are well appointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was super friendly . I felt like I was at home . Hotel was near a lot of shopping stores and more . We was in town for the Bears vs Eagles game and the stadium wasn ' t too far from the hotel . The free breakfast and evening social was phenomena ##l . The hotel was very clean [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town for a family celebration . Third stay at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker . Con ##ven ##ient location , pleasant staff , excellent breakfast and great ma ##rt ##ini ##s . This hotel is an old ##ie but still a good ##ie . Will return in July . See you then ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed one night as part of a larger party at the Ki ##nz ##ie . It is in a phenomena ##l location and if we would have realized that we would had stayed two nights , around the corner and down the street many great restaurants . The hotel itself does not have a bar , not needed , but they do a reception with drinks . in the morning it was a nice surprise that the continental breakfast and coffee was at the elevator bank on our floor , so I ' m assuming on every floor . Room was clean and nicely appointed . Would stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The rooms and facility was properly maintained especially with Co ##vid being a factor . I enjoyed my stay but the highlight of my stay was being greeted by Nik ##ko , the guest services re ##p . He was beyond exceptional and very knowledge ##able of the Chicago area . He went above and beyond to make sure my visit was memorable ! He officially part of my family now [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here in November and found the staff to be very nice . We didn ' t eat here , but i am told the food is good . The bed was great , the room was clean . We had great internet . The door ##men did a great job . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel near Michigan Avenue surrounded with a lot of luxury brands nearby to get shopping done . It is a block away from Chicago 360 ( the famous tilt window ) . Quiet neighborhood . Cal ##m and comfortable beds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is very well located , within walking distance to shops , restaurants , and bars . The lobby / front desk is on the 20th floor . There was someone at the ground level that instructed us to get into the elevator for check - in on the 20th floor . The bar is on the 20th floor as well . There ' s a rooftop bar , but it wasn ' t open because we visited in January . Our room was very nice , the bathroom is large and had a double van ##ity and a nice shower . Our room was very quiet . [SEP]
0	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt has always been a favorite brand . However , H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago fell far short of expectations for this long - term customer . Black mold in the shower and clothes closet and heavy dust were problematic resulting in a profound all ##er ##gy response . One of the conference rooms smelled of mold as well . My colleagues and I were significantly affected . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean rooms and re ##sp ##ons ##ive service . Will definitely reserve stay at this hotel in future . Breakfast is very good ! Great location walking distance to most shopping , W ##rig ##ley stadium and Broadway shows . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] B ##rief two night stay and had a wonderful time . Te ##rri ##fic location made for a short walk to wherever we wanted to go . Staff and service was excellent . We usually stay in the suburbs but if we decide to stay downtown again it will be at the I ##C hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Conrad Hilton in Chicago last week and it was my first time at the property . The rooms are beautifully appointed , quiet , and comfortable . Staff was friendly , helpful and did all that they could to make the stay memorable . The property is located close to f ##abulous restaurants ( within walking distance ) which is another big plus . Business travel is stress ##ful and never easy , but the Conrad was re ##f ##reshing in making the time more relaxing ! Thanks to Robert Ramos and Ash ##lee U ##bbe ##n for a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting me in such a special way . Think about staying at the Conrad - - it is a great home away from home ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , grand entry ##way , staff is very friendly . Lots of restaurant choices . Star ##bu ##cks on location with a market and very good hours . Great location to everything , highly recommend . No complaints for me [SEP]
1	[CLS] I always stay at the ambassador when in Chicago . Perfect location , nice de ##cor , and I love the bars and restaurant ( the food is out of this world and the staff is super friendly ) . I was there a few weeks ago for my birthday and Travis at the front desk went above and beyond to get me the perfect suite for my friends and I to celebrate . I highly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The O ##m ##ni is very well located just off the magnificent mile and is a comfortable hotel with some lovely rooms . Having said that , my room faced a terrace on the same floor as the pool / spa . The check in desk staff males were less than friendly however their female counterparts made up for it on departure ! In room breakfast very good and compared to eating the same at a restaurant , not too expensive . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect place to stay during Chicago marathon week . Well located , very clean and helpful staff . The rooftop is beautiful and the food was great ! Walking distance from the start and the finish line of the marathon . [UNK] The gym was very good and the breakfast was delicious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Conrad de ##cor and am ##bie ##nce has changed from 5 . 5 years ago . The am ##bie ##nce has a more sophisticated , m ##od feeling . The beds were more com ##fy than before . I stayed T ##hur th ##ru Sa ##t in Oct . I felt for the price , the am ##bie ##nce , the friendly staff , the room and bed comfort were well worth the money [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was great experience staying at Hilton Chicago . It is expensive but the first time I saw the lobby I knew it was worth it . It was really beautiful , luxurious and spectacular . However , the room was okay . Nothing special . The service was also great . Thanks ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I am a former resident of Chicago , and I have stayed at several hotels in several different locations - usually bringing my family while I am in town for work . This one was by far the best as far as easy access to a variety of reasonably priced restaurants - both table service and quick service . It is also convenient to shopping and transportation . We loved having the full kitchen , and the staff was friendly and eager to serve . We were there in the summer , and the hotel was very popular with families and European tourists at this time . The Guest ##s were very di ##ligent about taking advantage of the breakfast and the evening reception . I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Chicago on a budget . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful staff . Chad at the front door was great , front desk friendly . At ##tended events on premise and everyone was really efficient . Fitness room large enough to accommodate about a dozen people , pool looked very inviting , but I didn ' t use it . I know it ' s a small thing , but it was a pleasure to have a larger bar of soap than many hotels . Good location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We travel al ##ot and have experienced al ##ot of stays in hotels . All of them had a microwave and a mini fridge no matter if it was a 3 star but this one didn ' t : ( just because we got it only we got one of the worst rooms . Hope it ' s better next time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel for a Birthday Shopping weekend . The room was nice , clean and service was pro ##mpt . Our con ##cier ##ge was able to reserve a table for us at our restaurant of choice with short notice . I would rather have had a better view but this is hard to come by at this location . We will definitely be staying at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile in Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] After checking in and up ##grading to an executive suite for $ 50 more a night , I asked the staff " what time does the pool close ? " He stated the pool has been closed for over 2 years for renovation . There is a pool and pictures advertised on the site , the elevator still refers to the pool , and I specifically searched for a hotel with a pool . My daughter was completely disappointed . The hotel could only offer access to another Hilton 7 Chicago blocks away which meant either walk with a kid or take a cab , wet . The hotel room was okay , nothing impressive . The executive elevator was helpful as the hotel was s ##warm ##ed with conference attendees . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We thoroughly enjoyed the Hotel All ##egro ! The staff is very friendly . We enjoyed the prose ##cco happy hour ! The rooms are beautifully decorated . The bathroom ##s are small but that is to be expected in an old hotel . We definitely will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here two nights , and ended up parking in west loop with an online parking spot . It ' s easy enough to take public transit here and save on the 40 - 50 extra per night to park right there . The rooms for the most part have large windows overlooking the shop ##pers below . You certainly feel in the mix of everything ch ##ica ##go has to offer . You are only a few blocks from the theater district and Macy ' s , and a short trip to the magnificent mile . Would highly recommend for couples and small families . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I go to Chicago twice a year , once during spring and another during the fall . We have tried several Hilton properties in this area but the Home ##wood Suite ##s has the best value and nice ##st rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 2 nights ! Room ##s were clean with beautiful interior . Location is great and within walking distance to many bars / restaurants / shopping . Free breakfast in the am which is also a plus . I would stay again . They were running a special so the rooms were very affordable as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are great , location is perfect , and the staff , especially De ##J ##ana ##e , was extremely helpful and friendly ! Palmer House is the ideal location for a downtown vacation . Close enough to walk to just about everything . [SEP]
1	[CLS] great rooms , quiet location but central to everything . Con ##cier ##ge was excellent and couldn ' t help enough - thanks D ##wayne . Good cafe ##s and coffee close by . P ##lent ##y of shopping only a block away too . De ##fin ##ite ##ly stay again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay at the H ##ya ##tt Regency was very comfortable and pleasant . The staff were very at ##ten ##tive , room was clean , and the location was great in that we were able to walk to many wonderful Chicago sites . I highly recommend staying at the H ##ya ##tt . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at this hotel each time I attended the Illinois Governor ' s Council which takes place here annually in early February , and I love it . It ' s a Hilton , so I collect Hilton Honors Points . This status also grants me free high - speed internet and Executive Club status . The club is located on the 23rd floor , where convenient ##ly my room was located . The gym at the hotel is great ! It ' s quite big although the pool was closed for reservations during my stay . There is a Star ##bu ##cks on the ground level of the hotel . There are stores nearby where you can pick up water and other ne ##cess ##ities for the hotel . The service levels are very high here - great training . There ' s nothing I don ' t like about the hotel . Great option for a business stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice stay overall . The few staff I talked to were very nice . Beautiful lobby , bar area . Good location . Somehow got a room without a mini fridge . Unless you see the ice machine room when you get off the elevator , you ’ ll never find it ; no signs anywhere . TV was receiving no signal for a while . Bath towels need to be replaced . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice , modern rooms , well equipped , enough outlets , comfortable seating . Bed was very soft which I love . Dec ##ent breakfast . Good gym . Lo ##bby and entrance less appealing but ok . Room ##s are quiet . Would have loved N ##es ##press ##o machines in the room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a fantastic stay at the Hotel All ##egro . The staff was quick to respond to requests and made us and our four legged travel companion feel right at home . From having a dog bed set up for us on arrival , to extending our stay a few hours when our flight got cancelled . . we can ’ t thank Leah and Paige enough . We can ’ t wait to come back soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed my stay at The Ambassador . Easy check in . Simple and attractive design . The library bar is super comfortable and a delicious spot to chill . Ta ##sty drinks from the chemist ##s behind the bar . Room ##s were comfortable and clean . Simple design . And yes I would return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great overall experience ! Hotel staff very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and friendly . Stay ##ed one night after Thanksgiving and would definitely stay here again . Love ##d the fact that we just walked out the room and had coffee and a continental breakfast waiting for us ! Very convenient ! Didn ' t think we ' d have a chance to take advantage of happy hour with our busy schedule , but found that it was very nice to have a chance to go have a nice glass of wine and excellent shelf choices for a cocktail with a few little app ##eti ##zers ! Dec ##or of hotel modern but intimate and very appealing ! Location fantastic ! Close to everything ! Would stay here again ! Thank you everyone at Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel for excellent service ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel , facilities , location to shopping and restaurants and service was top notch , I would highly recommend this hotel . It is a great place for families , business or solo travel and in the center of the downtown action . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was my first time visiting Chicago and from what I had heard prior , it would be an expensive trip . With that being said , I was unaware of how horrible the parking situation would be . It was $ 60 for v ##alet to park my car as there were no other parking options near us . I rated our stay with this hotel based on the quality of the room we stayed in and the service we received . We enjoyed our stay , but if I were to visit here again I would more than likely choose another hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was definitely up to the high standards that one would expect of a Conrad . The room was large and clean , the water pressure solid , the staff friendly , etc . The location is a central one and well placed to run quick er ##rand ##s like getting coffee . If you are a business travel ##er and in particular a frequent Hilton client , you will be happy with the hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Easy check ##in . Great staff and lovely location . Room ##s were clean and beds were extremely comfortable . It was St . Patty ##s day weekend and although I was there for different reasons , it was nice to see the city alive and the many different events . And great food . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a wonderful stay with family at the Hilton Chicago ! The location is ideal - - right between the museum campus and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Friendly staff , spacious rooms ( L ##O ##VE ##D the rooms with two bathroom ##s ! ) , and full of charm - - especially for the holidays ! Don ' t miss the historical tour of the hotel - - Jessica gave our tour and it was one of the highlights of our visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This beautiful hotel is only a block from the River Walk and only about 3 blocks from the Millennium Train Station . The staff was so eager that we enjoy ourselves . They couldn ' t have been more a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . We were fortunate enough to have a room with a river view . We would go back here in a heartbeat [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location , not bad , but bit of a walk to most things you would like to do . Hotel bit tired . Only two out of three lifts working , and very slow . OK , but don ' t expect too much . OK place to rest your head if you are planning to be out most of the time . Not a hotel to relax in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of the most spacious hotels ! Kitchen ##ette and living area ( with fold out couch ) separate from the huge double bedroom and bathroom . We have teenagers and normally feel cramped but not here ! Staff were all exceptionally helpful and friendly , from the v ##alet , front desk staff , house ##keeping and breakfast crew . Central ##ly located to all of the major downtown attractions . We will definitely stay here again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here while attending a conference at McCormick Place . Hotel was spacious and clean . Restaurant ##s were good . There is a place to grab a quick bite to eat as well as sit down spots . The rooms were H ##U ##GE . Bonus points on the shower pressure which was AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! I ' m a loyal SP ##G girl and this is a hotel I will be back to ! One caution is that cab ##s / u ##ber had a hard time getting there due to construction so just make sure you leave a bit of time coming and going . [SEP]
1	[CLS] En ##joy ##ed the de ##cor , clean ##liness & v ##ibe of the Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro . Most of all it was central ##ly located to all the attractions & restaurants we wanted to visit . The staff was very helpful to all our in ##quire ##s as it was the 1st time we were visiting Chicago . Beautiful gathering areas just to relax & chat . Would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the Conrad Chicago twice , and plan to return . Love ##d it ! Great location , service , food , the rooms are perfect and beautiful . . . so elegant ! R ##oof top and lobby views are amazing ! Vale ##t and car parking too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Found an amazing deal on travel ##zo ##o . Was nervous because had never done that before , but worked out perfectly . Hotel was in a nice location . Con ##ven ##ient to the things we wanted to see , but not smack in the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le . We walked everywhere . Sure wish I had my Fi ##t ##bit ! Hotel was very clean . Bed ##s amazing . So quiet . . . never woke up to hall noise or neighbor noise . Staff very friendly and helpful . Had a f ##abulous French Sang ##ria at the bar . Room was ready when we arrived . Nice check ##out time , too ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was professional and court ##eous . The room was great ! The location of the hotel was close to all the events and attractions . The staff really went above and beyond their job descriptions to ensure that we had an awesome time ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Other than my check in ( was working with a new employee , she did her best ) , everything was outstanding across the board . Look forward to staying here on my next visit . Outstanding sleep in wonderful beds and excellent room service . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every time I come back here , I realize just how much I love this hotel ! Walking in to the beautiful lobby with fresh flower arrangements everywhere is just lovely . From the bell ##men , to the front desk , employees are warm and welcoming . The rooms are classic ; they have everything you need , with luxury toilet ##ries , to an incredible shower , and a bath ##tub . Our room wa spot ##less and well attended to every day without being bothered - They have a great bar , and a wonderful restaurant on site that has delicious breakfast ##s ! I love the location as well - out of the h ##ust ##le and noise , but in an ups ##cale setting close to great shopping and restaurants . We can ' t wait to return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful spacious rooms , great views . Nice bathroom with good lighting . After some overwhelming travel Nicole T . At the front desk was AM ##A ##Z ##ING getting us checked in and also had great suggestions for things to do in the area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They ruined our celebration for our 6 year old child by giving us the wrong information regarding their pool . The day we booked it they said they have a pool , the day of our visit they said they haven ’ t had one in 2 years . When we asked for compensation staff said “ there is nothing we can do ” and gave us the wrong email address to contact reservation or Man ##ag ##ment complaining about what happened . On top of it , we felt blamed by them making statements like how couldn ’ t we have known and asking for proof that staff gave us the wrong information . No ownership , not a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , defensive . We will not be going there again even though we have been their customers for 10 years now . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for one night . The room we clean and I really liked the bathroom ##s . The view from the room was also nice . I had minimal interaction with staff so I have no comment on service . I will say that having never stayed at a Conrad before but having stayed at plenty of other hotels , I expected a little more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fi ##st week I called , made re ##ser ##v . p ##d by CC ##ard . The next week to find out they screwed up & it never went th ##ru ? I called AG ##A ##IN . Price went up $ 130 . ! ! Was told $ 316 for 1 night in ##c ##l . All taxes & fees . . was a L ##IE ! ! Was told it in ##c ##l . F ##RE ##E BR ##EA ##K ##FA ##ST . . was another L ##IE ! ! P ##d $ 38 . for a bowl of o ##at ##me ##al , 3 sa ##usage ##s & toast . So instead of the $ 316 . I was told would be my total bill for the room . And yes I asked them twice when I booked the room what my bill would be . I was charged $ 40 ##9 . 93 . They L ##IE ##D AG ##A ##IN about taxes not included . And parking was $ 47 for a 10 h ##r stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love the Hotel Monaco in Chicago . All of the staff are so wonderful and make us feel like old friends . We had a great room with a sitting area and view with window seats . T ##H ##is is the only place we stay in CH ##ica ##go and will continue to be so . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had stayed at So ##fit ##el from July 25th till 30th and I loved it to bits . 1 . Location is just perfect . It is 2 min ##s walk from the shopping hub / mall and pretty much walking distance to the main attractions . C ##ab ##s are available at all times and everyone knows your hotel so no chance you will ever get lost or need GPS . 2 . Their cafe - CA ##F ##É DE ##S AR ##CH ##IT ##EC ##TE ##S very well set and the best part is that they have set menu for breakfast which makes it easier . The portion size however is too big for a person from India . 3 . The rooms are spacious and the view was gorgeous from my window . The beds , linen , bathroom , etc all very well maintained and kept . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A weekend stay , ch ##rist ##mas shopping . Very convenient - a 3 minute walk to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile , where you can walk right into the Water ##tower mall . The motel has a very modern v ##ibe throughout . The room was clean and room ##y , the mattress was comfortable and the pillows didn ' t flat ##ten . The bathroom was large and had a good ventilation system , The shower had easy controls . We stayed on the 7th floor right across from ##the elevator but never heard the noise from them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful . Clean , modern , spacious rooms with amazing views of the city . The beds are comfortable and the room amenities are decent . The staff was friendly . My only complaint is the extra charge on my credit card for a night ' s stay . I had pre - paid my stay using a booking agent . I had to call the hotel ' s accounting department and get them to investigate the charge . They reversed it . However , I shouldn ' t need to spend my time calling accounting and checking my bank statement . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel puts you right behind A ##on Center - - just north of Millennium Park - - sort of between the Loop and Michigan Avenue . The hotel is quite nice , and the corner room was one of my favorites . I could see down Randolph Avenue in one direction and into the A ##on Center offices in the other direction . My room had a bath ##tub AND a shower - - much more than I expected . The bed was comfortable . Breakfast was ta ##sty , though perhaps a bit slow at first . I would definitely stay in this business hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A very nice choice if you want to be as close to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile as to the best restaurants , department stores and the Red Line that will take you to any sport stadium in town . Nice suites with full kitchen , king size bed , gym and pool available on the top floor and excellent breakfast and managers reception at the end of the work day . Friendly and helpful staff adds to the nice experience . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] All of the staff makes an effort to be very welcoming and helpful . The con ##cier ##ge left a welcome note for our son , a nice touch that was unnecessary but appreciated . The stay had multiple moments like that . This is a great location , good access to various modes of transportation and walk ##able access a wide range of food styles and price points . This is an older building that has been updated and well appointed without losing the historic feel . The elephant in the room , so to speak , is the elevators . Nice and co ##zy . But plan for extra travel time during prime check - in / out time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There wasn ’ t a microwave in the room or in the lobby . The biggest problem was the room was not fully cleaning . We found a dirty so ##ck underneath the chairs and we found underwear underneath our bed ##ding . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here over the recent Thanksgiving holiday . The location was very convenient . This is a well - maintained property , with fantastic customer service from all the staff that we encountered . The common areas are clean , quiet , and elegant . The room was similarly clean and elegant . I would stay here again , though the regular prices are a bit steep . ( We got a reduced room rate because of the holiday . ) Vale ##t parking was expensive as you would expect for the location , but was very fast , court ##eous , and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is massive with a dull interior and exterior . Check - in was a mess . The room requested months before to be adjacent to my friends room wasn ’ t ready until 7 ##pm ( check in is 3 ##pm ) and was filled with cigarette smoke . I was moved to a different room which was fine and still close to my friends . There are no room refrigerator ##s ( they ’ re filled with magnetic over ##p ##rice ##d items that if you touch you get charged for ) . The bar / restaurants are ok but the servers seem stressed and unhappy . The location is good for downtown but getting out of downtown Chicago is the best part of the visit ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great spot to be to see all the sites . Very easy to get an U ##ber or L ##y ##ft from this hotel . Everything seemed to be 4 - 5 miles away from the hotel . Hotel was clean and the bar looked good too . House ##keeping was always at our door ready to clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked a room on hotel tonight and got a price match , an upgrade , and E ##X ##CE ##P ##TI ##ON ##AL G ##UE ##ST SE ##R ##VI ##CE ! I wanna shout ##out VI ##CT ##OR ##IA for being swift and friendly as well as providing a perfect check in ! She ’ s the pretty tall blonde young woman ! Ku ##dos to her and the staff and hotel as a whole ! Have been coming here and will continue to stay here ! ! ! P ##s , did I already say they price match ? ? ? Yes ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is wonderful ##ly located , an easy walk to Michigan Avenue and State Street . The compliment ##ary breakfast and evening social were great ! The staff is friendly and helpful . Will stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fair ##ly pleasant hotel - although a few ni ##ggles dropped the rating . Hotel ha ##rass ##es you into getting your room checked if you don ##t let house keeping come in each day which was incredibly invasive ( and annoying when they then don ##t come when they say they are ) . No breakfast option . Room was either freezing cold with air ##con or too hot , te ##mp doesn ##t seem to regulate properly . ! ! ! ! - $ 200 dollar hold on your card when you check in - which they didn ##t take off until 3 weeks later ! - You can see directly from building opposite into the room so had to have curtains closed constantly . Po ##sitive ##s - little shop on ground floor where you can buy ( over ##p ##rice ##d ) snack ##s . If you ' re early you can leave luggage in storage facility . For the price would stay elsewhere . Won ' t be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were in town for the last few days of a driving vacation . The Johnny Weiss ##mu ##ller pool is so incredible we could have spent our time pool and pools ##ide except the hotel is right in the middle of so many things to see and do . Lots of fun ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent service , convenience , and kindness , while I stayed there and after I already left . I must highlight the kindness and efforts of the hotel manager Cody Cook who went above and beyond to assist me in finding an item that I left in taxi on the way to the airport . Superior service ! I ##mp ##ress ##ive ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ask for lake view . Great trip to see the Black ##hawks , wonderful room , great bed and bed ##ding , awesome breakfast ! Wonderful ##ly welcoming and so clean and luxurious without being huge ##ly expensive ! Would stay here again in a heartbeat ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] So glad I chose She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago for a recent girls trip to Chicago . Upon arrival we were greeted with so much enthusiasm by John that you couldn ' t help but feel welcomed and appreciated as a guest . The location was excellent , the rooms were clean , comfortable and quiet . Plus great river views ! ! The front desk staff handled our room requests and check - in quickly and court ##eous ##ly . BT ##W , John also saw us off when we left to return to Wisconsin . . . what an incredible She ##rato ##n Grand employee ! ! Will definitely book again when the opportunity arises ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent the weekend in Chicago . We stayed at the B ##EA ##UT ##IF ##U ##L Palmer House Hilton . Love ##d the Art Institute , and lunch was tremendous . Unfortunately , we got barely 3 hours of sleep because the neighboring room became a party room ##o . Palmer House Security said they would handle it B ##UT nothing changed . I mentioned it when we checked out . The check ##out clerk said and did nothing to make am ##ends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker numerous times and it has always been pleasant . However , on my most recent stay , October 7 , I er ##rone ##ously left a skirt in my room . I would take full responsibility for my loss if my skirt wasn ' t found by house ##keeping . However , I called the hotel the next day and was told they had found my skirt and would ship it to me . More than a month later , I haven ' t received my skirt . Now , according to lost & found , there is no record of it in their log . I was promised a return call , which I have not received . And my email to guest services remains un ##ans ##wer ##ed . Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights for work , but would stay for non - work too if opportunity arose . Easy check - in , greeted g ##rac ##iously by the check - in staff . Room was f ##abulous , and the breakfast up on the 6th floor was great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel , Friendly staff that are always happy to help . Very clean rooms . Only area that needs up ##dating is the pool as it ’ s out ##dated . Restaurant is nice with a great selection of food and drink . Hotel is in a great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a few " issues " during our stay however the staff always resolved any problems we encountered with over the top service . The rooms are small however nicely appointed and clean . . . great city views . Would stay here again if I find myself in Chicago again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a beautiful hotel that is a highlight of our trips to Chicago . The staff is excellent and the rooms clean . The architecture in the lobby is amazing ! Sit ##uated close to the Art Institute and several theaters , it ' s location is ideal ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a historic hotel , with all of the time ##less design features . What impressed me most was their new con ##cier ##ge text service . Once checked in , I received a text from someone ( which I thought was routine ) welcoming me . Later , when I grabbed the wrong stack of cards without my room key , I used the text service - they immediately responded and dispatched security to get me in . They also advised on extended check ##out , where to go for some necessary meeting supplies , etc . Bravo ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve stayed here many times and its always a great experience . Room ##s are very nice and service is welcoming and time ##ly . The value is outstanding for the quality of accommodation ##s and location . I will continue to select O ##m ##ni as my first choice every time I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our stay thanks to the friendly , kinda and at ##ten ##tive staff at the hotel . We es ##c ##pec ##ially appreciated D ##wayne who assisted us in hail ##ing our u ##ber . He was very engaging and helpful ! We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A class ##y hotel in a good location . Friendly staff and a very interesting tour around the hotel giving its history . This was our first stop on Route ##6 ##6 and proved to be one of our favourite ##s . We chose self parking just across the road . Sad ##ly the man there wasn ' t quite so friendly ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The de ##cor of the hotel and the rooms is very old ( out ##dated ) and dark . Bath ##rooms are very tiny and the sink is practically useless . The room I stayed in smelled must ##y . Hopefully that ' s an isolated issue . I asked for a late check ##out the next day so I could quickly change from my suit to comfortable clothes for flying . I was told there is a $ 50 fee . I travel frequently , usually about 50 hotel stay nights a year and have never encountered this . I was in town for a meeting and the company I visited made the arrangements . I understand they frequently use this property but i expressed to them my di ##ssa ##tisfaction so hopefully they ' ll find another property as this bad experience somewhat reflects poorly on them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location on the airport shuttle route . Walking distance to Navy Pier . Very close by you can find Whole Foods , Target , and a large movie theater . U ##ber pickup / drop ##off sign out in the front . Drive to McCormick 15 minutes or so . Room large and clean . Bed comfortable . Service ok . I called for a hot water k ##ett ##le and it didn ' t show up after several hours . Second call worked . Con ##cier ##ge service mixed . One lady was helpful and set me up with a car rental nearby . A second lady on the evening shift un ##hel ##pf ##ul when I had some questions . Areas surrounding the hotel kind of " dead " on a weekend . Restaurant ##s are some distance away . Overall reliable large hotel with " average to good " everything . I have no problem to stay again on a business trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at Ki ##nz ##ie over the weekend with our kids . Great hotel & staff . Made sure that we had everything that we needed . Location is close to Michigan Ave . and other attractions . Good value as well . De ##fin ##ite ##ly one of the best in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My original visit was 13 months ago . That experience influenced this visit and we were not disappointed . The room was f ##abulous and service exceptional . The 720 bar was welcoming and a great place to relax . My favorite was the connection with staff . Steve in the 720 bar , 13 months later , still remembered my name , where I was from and my beverage of choice . That personal touch makes the Hilton Chicago a home away from home and it will be a regular part of our Chicago visits . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This is a classic luxury hotel . Often an older hotel like this will have small rooms , but our room ( 2 beds ) was very spacious . Clean and com ##fy just like you ' d want , and just a half block from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile in downtown Chicago . It ' s an easy walk to loads of shopping ( including the Michigan Avenue Disney Store - my wife ' s favorite ! ) , and great restaurants , including three of Chicago ' s top deep dish pizza joints . Craig , the Bell ##man , was extremely helpful and persona ##ble ! We were in town for the Chicago Auto Show ( worth attending if you get the chance ) , and we couldn ' t have selected a better place to stay ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ing at Home ##wood Suite ##s was a first for us . We were attending a show at Chicago Theatre and it was within walking distance . We paid for the Park and Stay upgrade and also paid extra for v ##alet parking , but it was well worth the price for the convenience . The hotel was very clean , rooms beautiful and spot ##less . The bed was very com ##fy and the view was awesome ! The staff couldn ' t have been more friendly and helpful . It was a very hot day ( 112 degrees ) and our room wasn ' t ready when we arrived , but they were able to get us checked in and in our room within 20 minutes . Very impressive ! The breakfast was delicious ! Would definitely recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : 1 ) Great location for the sites of Chicago 2 ) Columbus Ta ##p ale ##s ( avoid the food ) . 3 ) Great cleaning staff . Room always fresh . 4 ) Reason ##ably priced for the location . 5 ) Dec ##ent fitness centre ( not center ! ) . Con ##s : 1 ) Check - in experience involves upgrade selling . 2 ) Lu ##dic ##rous laundry charges . 3 ) Columbus Ta ##p should be for ale not food . 4 ) By U . S . standards the rooms are not large . 5 ) Some staff are sur ##ly to guests . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great location if you ' d like to be close enough to walk the River Walk , Navy Pier , restaurants and bars . It was my first time in Chicago and I ' d definitely consider staying at this hotel again if I get a chance to return to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was nice and comfortable . The small refrigerator was a helpful item . The staff were excellent - - the high ##point of our stay ! We like the hotel ' s location . Clearly there had been a great deal of thought placed to make our travel experience safe . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here in August for 3 nights . The first room we got had a really bad disgusting smell from the air conditioning when it was switched on and no plug for the bath . My partner complained and they said they would fix it . Later that day it still had not been fixed when he complained again we got a room upgrade . This room was excellent . It had great views , no smell , a bath with a plug and great views . Due to the upgrade I rated this hotel as very good . The hotel was a short walk from the main shops and sights ##ee ##ing buses . And a 20 - 30 min walk to Navy Pier [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted as a group of friends being tourists in Chicago for the first time . The location is brilliant as are the staff . We were really happy with the package on offer which included breakfast . All staff were friendly , helpful and wore smiles but there is special videos for the door ##man who greeted us like friends and the helpful breakfast waiter . The loop train is a noisy addition to the environment but didn ' t cause us to lose sleep . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Unfortunately we were greeted by some unhappy employees at re ##gis ##tra ##ion . They seemed put out by our checking in . Never smiled and made us feel like we were a bother . Then as we tried to get in our room our room cards didn ' t work . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The ha ##li ##but was dry and rest of the good was taste ##less , strange and lacked flavor including the straw ##berries for dessert . The bathroom had prior guests bath remnants on the shower walls that had not been cleaned . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie ! Everything was perfect from the location to clean ##liness & a great breakfast included to boot . Gerry & Alex at the front desk were especially nice & helpful with great tips for things to do & packages to offer with amazing deals on must do & see Chicago fun . I won ' t be staying anywhere else when I visit this awesome city in the future ! ! ! ! It ' s rare that a hotel gets everything right these days . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a pretty disappointing stay at this hotel . While the room itself was adequate , there was no view . The worst part came when we wanted to store our bags after checking out , and were told we had to pay $ 3 per bag ( so $ 12 for our 4 bags ) . Apparently paying hundreds of dollars per night does not cover this basic hotel service that has been offered for free at the over 100 hotels I have visited previously . The excuse of the front desk manager was that the storage is outs ##our ##ced , but if the hotel wanted to , it would definitely be possible to com ##p this service for paying guests . With how much paying guests are penny - pinched , I can only imagine how bad it must be for the hotel staff , hence their strike . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , great staff , great view ! ! Near lots of wonderful restaurants ! All the best shopping is a quick walk away ! We will always stay at the So ##fit ##el when we visit Chicago ! Great value for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had tickets for the Anna Karen ##ina Ballet and didn ' t want to travel back to the b ##ur ##bs so we booked a room at an old favorite . Never disappointed with the room , v ##alet parking , breakfast and the service . Always exceptional . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Honestly exactly what you would expect . Beautiful , looked just like the pictures . Park ##ing was confusing but there ’ s a v ##alet right outside the hotel , just stop there and read the sign . Overall lovely experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome park right in the middle of downtown Chicago . My kids all ( 11 , 7 , 4 and 3 ) loved the splash pad / fountain . There was some sort of classical concert in the park as well . Beautiful gardens all throughout . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had the pleasure of staying at the Fair ##mont during a conference for my husband . The hotel itself is in a prime location . The lobby seems nice and neat . Our room was great and very clean . My best experience is with in room dining . specifically Dolores . She was so helpful and even made my birthday special during my stay . Room service was great to work with . We had a great time and great experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had 2 nights with temperatures in Chicago of - 25 ##f . . the hotel worked perfectly . Everything you ’ d expect of a good city centre hotel . Great rooms , really good staff . We could walk to all the sights - Mill ##eni ##um Park , the Pier , and Sears Tower . We didn ’ t eat there - there ’ s a great breakfast diner next door , and lots of excellent restaurants nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A warm and friendly welcome from staff . Hotel and room very clean and warm . Location is excellent . Really pleased we chose this hotel . Didn ’ t try food and drink but the bar looked very impressive ! Upon check ##out the hotel looked after our bags with no fee . I ##mp ##ress ##ive . Thank you . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago at 720 South Michigan Avenue was an amazing stay ! The staff was extremely helpful and court ##eous ! ! This historic hotel has somehow maintained it ' s elegant charm while staying current with all of today ' s modern convenience ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent 4 days at the She ##rato ##n on business . The hotel was located in a very central part of Chicago with easy access to many great restaurants and attractions . check in was very easy and the room was spacious and comfortable . The bathroom was clean and modern with nice shower ( good pressure ) . Bed ##s were very comfortable and I had a nice night sleep . Con ##cier ##ge was good at making reservations for the architecture boat tour which was a highlight . Good restaurant selections . Only negative in this hotel was a lack of restaurant choices . Only Shu ##la ' s after 7 : 00 p . m . which was expensive and heavy food . no place but room service to get a bite to eat . El ##eva ##tors could also be very slow . Other than that it was a great stay and I would def ##inate ##ly book again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay overall . Perfect location . Great rooms . Great service . Fantastic Bar ! ! ! The beer selection is one of the best I have ever seen in a hotel . If you don ' t like what they have , you are just steps away from many other great gathering places . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was staying here for business and , as usual , I look for a good location , quiet , clean and well appointed room and re ##sp ##ons ##ive staff . This provided those . The location is on the more northern end of the center of Chicago . It ' s not bang smack in the middle of the action but you ' re only 5 minutes walk away from that - and that ' s probably why I got a quiet room . The hotel is modern and the rooms are well appointed . I was on a high floor and had a fun view of the surrounding sky ##scraper ##s . The hotel was quite reasonably priced for the quality it provided . I ' d consider staying here again when I visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pi ##llow ##s were terrible . Room cooling unit failed so I stayed in a friend ' s room until the last night when she went home early and had to call engineering to fix the the ##rm ##ost ##ate 75 degrees ! even though set on much lower 67 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked through Hilton Honors site unseen the day before arriving as we switched from NYC to Chicago after flights cancelled . Could not have worked out better . Great location , wonderful room , excellent people and service . The bar had an excellent selection of b ##our ##bon ##s , the food was very good . Bart ##ender gave us great recommendations for unique water ##ing holes . House ##keeping did a great job cleaning up after our 12 y ##r old . All and all no complaints . Would highly recommend and hope to stay there again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed here for a weekend away for my boyfriend ##s birthday . I was able to choose a special package to have in our room before we arrived as a surprise for him . Everything was there waiting for us and it was wonderful ! The front desk even gave me suggestions on where to find a last minute outfit because weather conditions delayed a package I was waiting on . Everyone was very nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The hotel is gorgeous . Our room was on the small side , but very comfortable and beautiful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ho ##rrible service . R ##ude front desk . Old rooms that are extremely un ##im ##pressive . You can easily hear your neighbors in some of the rooms as well . Check out the Conrad or the London House instead . We had to change rooms and ended up checking out early to go to another Hilton property . After checking out the in ##vo ##ice for the room price had doubled . It had a beautiful lobby and is classical ##ly beautiful . Check out the lobby and enjoy a drink if you can but we won ’ t be staying here ever again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location right on the river walk and a block from Michigan Ave . Clean comfortable room . Getting a room with the city view is definitely worth it . A gift shop , marketplace and several restaurants on site . Would definitely stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was very pleased with the hotel . It was beyond my expectations , and i have traveled a lot . Everything was walking distance , and room was very con ##fy I have particularly enjoyed hospitality of the staff , Jo ##van and Lauren [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here again as was good last time , and it didn ##t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Was visiting with a friend for some Christmas shopping and to show her around Chicago . Great location , the suites have 2 rooms so ideal as we had a room each . P ##lent ##y of hot water and good w ##if ##i . Breakfast was fine , and the " evening reception " on a couple of nights we were there was more than adequate . Will be back [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is not The W ##aldo ##rf , but it definitely competes with the other higher tier Chicago hotels . Price is much better than those other higher tier hotels . Room ##s are nicely appointed . Soft linen ##s , robes and slip ##pers provided are incredibly com ##fy . Water , N ##es ##press ##o machine and hot water k ##ett ##le are always nice amenities and much appreciated . Bath ##room has a beautiful and large double van ##ity with an enclosed toilet and shower on the opposite end . Overall , nice place and will absolutely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love the Hilton Chicago , Mr . Do ##y was amazing he shared so ##o much information with me his customers service was amazing . He was able to answer all my questions , he kept a smile on my sister and i faces and i felt very welcomed to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We couldn ' t get waited on in the bar , even going up to the bartender who couldn ' t be bothered to serve two white haired old ladies . What they don ' t know is we tip big . Burger ##s on the River ##walk were fantastic . Conference food was very good . Small room , bottle ##d water $ 16 . 00 in the room . Seriously ! ! We moved over to the W ##yn ##dham which was far better overall . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for my son ' s wedding . The location is excellent . A 15 minute walk to Navy Pier or to Millennium Park . The hotel over ##look ##s the Chicago River Walk . Like all hotel restaurants , over ##p ##rice ##d , but there are a lot of dining option nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would highly recommend . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful . P ##lent ##y of restaurants and shopping within walking distance . It was a great family vacation . The Conrad was an added plus to the whole family experience in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room and bathroom were very large , nicely appointed and very clean . The staff was S ##O friendly and helpful . In particular , the con ##cier ##ge Ken , was great in steering us around the city map and recommend ##ing restaurants . The room even has an umbrella for a guest ' s use which was most handy since it rain ##ed for 5 days ! There is a compliment ##ary breakfast set up on each floor and a compliment ##ary happy hour every day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in the heart of the city and a very great location . Especially if you love premium brand , Louis V ##uit ##ton is just on the corner less than 30 second walk from hotel . The rooms are large , very spacious and clean . There is a mini bar in the room with snack ##s and some sa ##ni ##tary products . Only draw ##back , no room service . I was a little taken a ##back by that because of the nature of my job , sometimes I just want to rest and eat in my room . There is a restaurants and they have nice breakfast options . Friendly staff and great location . The electors are a bit tired looking and one was out of service whilst I was there out of the three available , and a slight wait waiting to get up to my room . Other an that a very nice stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t to Chicago with granddaughter for the American Beauty Show . Wanted to be close to shopping and easy access to McCormick Place . This hotel is lovely . It was a first class experience starting with the v ##alet parking , check in right through check out . Staff are well trained and very helpful . We had a king suite with a bedroom and sleep ##er sofa in separate room . We asked to have a refrigerator and there was one in the room when we checked in . The rooms were clean , well appointed and comfortable . We had dinner in the restaurant and it was very nice . Service was good and the food was excellent . Walk ##ed to stores to shop and easy 15 minute drive to McCormick . Would absolutely stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was excellent , service - wise , location and accommodation ##s ! ! Very up to date . Very clean . I would recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone traveling to Chicago . The location is right in the center of the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about this hotel was perfect . Location , staff , and overall aesthetic . Very comfortable beds , great water pressure . Hands down the best hotel in Chicago . Next time I visit , I will definitely be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A fine hotel , made fine ##r with an upgrade to Fair ##mont Gold , which gave us access to the excellent Gold Lounge . Super ##visor Mu ##gi and his staff attendant ##s , Sharon , Man ##dan ##a and Henry are court ##eous , at ##ten ##tive , and competent professionals who made our stay pleasant and worry free . They offered excellent advice , made reservations , even took care of check ##out with u ##t ##most efficiency . The hotel itself is warm and in a great location . All staff are well - trained and friendly . Really , really good , but this time the difference was Gold ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed there for the 3 time and there seemed to be no upgrades . It is an older hotel . The elevators are small and hard to fit in one during check ##out times . I think we will op ##t for a newer hotel from now on . Unless you pay a lot for a suite the regular rooms are very small . The " superior " rooms are not worth the money . They aren ' t much larger at all with very little drawer space . Also , check to see if your room has a bath ##tub . Our ##s did not but we thought it did . Also the wood was rotting in the bathroom by the shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed in this hotel for only 3 nights but they were the most com ##fy beds , co ##zy place and good . I remember the first thing I saw before having breakfast , was the fire place . Even though it was September , it was on and it gave such a co ##zy atmosphere ! Dr ##ink ##ing some good coffee with m ##uff ##ins made us feel very happy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! Right off of miracle mile ! Great views of the city ! Staff are super friendly and the continental dinner ##s and breakfast ##s come with the room and are prepared by go ##ur ##met chef ##s . Only one down ##side ; if you go in winter , ask to have them open the windows . The central air is set only to heat setting . We would totally stay there again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel a while back when it was known as the Am ##al ##fi , and went back wondering if it would be as nice but were again delighted with our choice . We had a room at the back of the hotel this stay and we still found it fairly quiet for a city stay . The room and bathroom were clean and modern and both have been nicely re ##fit ##ted since our last stay . The b ##uff ##et breakfast and evening receptions were both very enjoyable . It was a bit rainy during our stay but we were close enough to lots of restaurants and attractions to get out without getting too wet - although the hotel even puts an umbrella in the closet in case you are vent ##uring further a ##field ! We were very happy with everything and would definitely consider the Ki ##nz ##ie again for our next stay in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When pulling up to the Conrad I was greeted by more than one smiling face directing me to the 20th floor lobby . The location was perfect with a killer rooftop bar . The rooms were spacious and very clean with a large flat screen television . Great mattress with nice linen ##s and a V ##ER ##Y large bathroom . Love ##d the placement of the room safe . I can honestly say that this is the first time in a very long time that I did not need to knee ##l down in a dark closet to place my valuable ##s in the safe . The entire staff was super friendly and a special shout out to the young lady who brought my luggage to my room ( sorry I did not catch her name ) . I will surely stay at the Conrad on my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice service , clean hotel and friendly staff . I enjoyed the view of the city of Chicago , and the compliment ##ary drinks that came with the honors program . The lobby is beautiful and all the floor is clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] had a great stay at this hotel . they have an outstanding staff to assist their guests . def ##ini ##tley would stay there again . the only down ##side was The Palm restaurant located in the lobby . I had a horrible experience there with slim ##y waiter , so our entire group cancelled all our reservations there , along with few other guests . Swiss ##ote ##l was so great that I would absolutely stay there again , but just not eat at the The Palm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel perfect location , very helpful front desk staff . Ethan turned a nightmare from Price ##line into a pleasant stay he made sure check ##in was quick and efficient on arrival will recommend to others [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was pretty much standard fare for a major chain inner city property , though I will say that the bed was spectacular . We asked for a higher room and were treated to views of Lake Michigan , Navy Pier and some beautiful sky ##scraper ##s . The lobby is very nice - - much better than the entry to the p ##ric ##ier Lowe ##s just across Water Street , and the driveway handles drop ##offs and pickup ##s very well . The walk to Michigan Avenue and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile is just two minutes away , and of course major shopping and entertainment are blocks away . If you can find a room for under $ 250 , jump on it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a member o H ##ya ##tt program and I expected to be treated better . They have sent me to the West Tower , on a very old room , and the worse part is , it was clean properly if it was cleaned at all . I got late to the room and exhausted , so I decided not to complain immediately . When I use the rest ##room it was old and the shower didn ' t worked properly . On the next morning it got worse as I saw even toe nails on the carpet , that was not being vacuum ##ing for some time . After I complained they vacuum it ( the nails were not there anymore ) that all the dust and small pieces of papers and other staff was still there . I have photos to prove . BA ##D experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was amazing , been here for a couple of days , no issues , amazing room and bar , worth 100 % . Amazing staff , everyone was really helpful ##l , kind and friendly . Perfect location ! ! Would surely come back ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] ( Note : This was CO ##VI ##D times . ) The Talbot ##t is in a great spot , walking distance from shopping and restaurants ( though not an easy walk in the stinging s ##lee ##t b ##lizzard while we were there ) . Check - in was safe and sa ##ni ##tary . The hotel restaurant was closed , but there ' s a partnership with a pool ##ed room service company , and the bar was also shut ##tered but there was a grab - and - go zone in the lobby with adult beverages for sale . We look forward to going again in a warmer , well - v ##ac ##cin ##ated season . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is an old , large , and well maintained hotel near the South Loop and across from Grant Park . I travel quite a bit for work , and this is by far the best athletic club of any hotel I have ever stayed at . There is a large space devoted to the fitness center , lots of equipment and a beautiful lap pool . The facilities are very clean and the staff is very nice . It was a highlight of a long work week in Chicago to be able to work out in such a great facility every morning . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The overall quality of this hotel has not met our expectations . The great location is why we stay here but were disappointed with the value received for the money spent . The room we reserved months in advance was not " reserved " and we had to take another type of room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay for my daughter ' s birthday was fantastic ! The view from the room is so amazing , I wanted to stay up on the bench all day ! Also the staff was great - especially reception and wine hour ! We were able to take the bikes out for free too - great bikes ! Will definitely stay there again ! Love the Kim ##pton hotels ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel in great location for Chicago visit - less than one block from magnificent mile for all your shopping needs . Hotel very clean and room was better than expected . Would stay here again and highly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] When we won the Hamilton ticket lottery ( AM ##A ##Z ##ING ) , we decided to stay overnight and we are glad we did . Used hotel tonight to book a room at s ##wi ##sso ##tel ( use spot ##her ##o to book parking and you will save a bundle ) . Hotel was great . Clean room and wonderful staff . View of the river . Quiet . Super convenient location to everything . But . . . know that when you book through an app there are D ##A ##IL ##Y fees . Not a giant deal because we were only there one night but added almost $ 25 to our stay . First time this has happened but know that the hot ##leton ##ight app has hidden fees , . Co ##mp ##are your costs . It might be cheaper to book through the hotel ' s website . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We travel into the City frequently , this is our new go to hotel . The price is right , the rooms are very sharp . Very helpful staff . Everything was im ##ma ##culate and the evening happy hour is first class . We will be back ! All in all a great find . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently flew in to attend a wedding and the hotel was recommended by the bride ’ s mother . I was quite happy with my overall experience . It was central ##ly located and the room and hotel was clean and well maintained for the price we paid . The staff was very friendly and helpful . I would definitely recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very convenient for exploring Chicago . 1 block from red line , steps from Navy Pier trolley . Nice to have kitchen in room . Sleep ##er sofa a little uncomfortable . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary breakfast good money saving [SEP]
1	[CLS] Worth a 3 . 5 . All is good and clean , which is the main thing , but nothing is amazing . A few details - - Was surprised not be able to get orange juice , I had to ask . I guess it is how it is in the US . - Also the gym looked good but 85 % of the space is taken by card ##io equipment with 30 % guests using it , and 15 % of the space dedicated to weight but 70 % of guests que ##uing up . - There was no glass in the bathroom to put a tooth brush . Obviously not a big deal , but still a bit annoying . Check in and check out were very smooth . The lake view from my room was very good , I made sure I looked at it every morning . As mentioned elsewhere , the location is perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Ambassador to begin our 30th anniversary celebration , and it was wonderful . The room had a great view , the all white d ##é ##cor was very clean and elegant , the bed was quite comfortable . We were very happily surprised with a chilled bottle of champagne from the Guest Relations Manager Travis Howard , which made a fantastic kick ##off to our weekend . The hotel ' s Booth One restaurant was also super . We tried the aged rib ##eye , Pa ##rm ##esan spin ##ach , and t ##ruff ##le r ##is ##ott ##o , which were all exquisite , and the service from Andrew S . was really spectacular . He made us feel like royalty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d the hotel . Perfect location , walking distance to shopping , Navy pier , River ##walk , 2 miles to Lincoln zoo ( need reservation ) along Lake . Wine bar was open , but restaurants in hotel not , but they were te ##rri ##fic with Star ##bu ##cks in hotel . Large TV , shower ##s great , internet , refrigerator in room and great pool and exercise rooms . Will come back for next trip . Ava at front desk is a rock star for service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here for two nights while visiting relatives in Chicago . The location is great , right on Michigan Ave . - in the heart of great shopping , etc . However , the hotel was crowded and in need of up ##dating . Pro ##s : Room was clean and beds were com ##fy . Check - in and out was easy and service was friendly . Con ##s : El ##eva ##tors are small and there were lines to get on every time we were going up or down . Room was small , dated and lacked modern essential ##s - like sufficient plug ##s for charging devices , etc . Bath ##room was bordering on din ##gy and sink didn ' t drain . We have stayed at other hotels in the area that are newer and offered a better experience at a similar price . Will not return here . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I opted for an upgraded room ( + $ 20 ) in the West Tower overlooking the river , the view is very nice . Room is good size with comfortable bed , large TV with ch ##rome ##cast , window seat , desk , Star ##bu ##cks tea and coffee , safe , iron , free W ##i ##F ##i , mini ##bar , hair ##dr ##yer , wardrobe , Air ##C ##on / heating . I didn ’ t take breakfast so I can ’ t comment on that . My very minor complaints - no bottle ##d water in room , fixed head shower rather than hand held shower head and the TV is f ##rust ##rating ##ly slow to respond do the remote control . Location is great , right on the river and also near to Michigan Avenue shopping and theatres in the Loop . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I always stay at O ##m ##ni when visiting Chicago . The team at this location really understands the value of great customer service . From the time you are greeted at the door to the time you leave , the entire staff go above and beyond to meet all of your needs . The hotel is clean , is in a great location , and the staff is top notch . If you need anything , just call the front desk and they will address it very quickly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had a wonderful stay ! The room was a little small , but beautiful , clean , and co ##zy . The staff was so kind , the food at Le Bar was delicious , the drinks were price ##y and a bit weak , but nonetheless creative and y ##um ##my . We did not have a refrigerator in the room to hold left ##overs , but the bartender offered to store it for us and re - heat it when we needed it . They give you free water each day and when we needed more the con ##cier ##ge was kind enough to give us some extra bottles . The location was near all the tourist attractions and lots of shopping in the area . Also lots of bars , restaurants , and clubs all within walking distance . This hotel made my first trip to Chicago so wonderful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here at the beginning of June 2016 after spot ##ting a bargain online . The hotel is in a great looking building in a brilliant area . We didn ' t know much about Chicago but found it so easy to get around being based here . Really close to the lake and subway line . The rooms were decorated white throughout and looked really fresh . We didn ' t use the restaurant or bar as our 5 year old was with us but they always looked busy . There are great places to eat and drink nearby . We loved Has ##h House A Go Go round the corner for breakfast and dinner - massive portions . We are planning to return to Chicago soon as it ended up being one of our favourite cities and would definitely consider staying here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My son ' s weddings was beautiful . Thanks Darius , front desk supervisor , for your making our stay extra special . . Your professional and friendly service was much appreciated . P ##s , Bed ##s comfortable , rooms small . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel several times and always for business . This hotel is in an excellent location , within walking distance of Navy Pier and Millennium Park . Food choices within the hotel are somewhat limited but many restaurants nearby . I highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a long weekend . The staff was excellent and we were right next door to one of the theaters . The restaurant is located in the hotel and there is wine at 5 and coffee in the lobby in the morning . There are many places to sit in the lobby for just people watching if that ' s all you want to do . The rooms are nicely decorated and the beds and pillows are wonderful for a good night ' s sleep . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Once again the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker proved to be a great place to stay . Third time staying here . This is now without a doubt our go to hotel when visiting Chicago . Service was excellent . Part ##icular ##ly Craig the bell hop and also David who greeted us at the front door when we arrived . Room ##s very clean and comfortable . Location of this hotel is excellent for sight seeing , shopping , etc . We will definitely be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] the Fair ##mont is a really nice hotel . Room was beautiful and clean . The food in the hotel was ta ##sty . The services were spot on . This is a great location with lots to see and do . Everyone was really friendly and bent over backwards to please you [SEP]
0	[CLS] Wish I knew about this hotel prior to my sons moving out of Chicago . I would have stayed here every time . The best ! We had an option to use this hotel for a wedding stay and so glad we did . No complaints at all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay . Olivia Miller checked us in and was amazing . She helped us upgrade to a suite that had amazing views of the lake and river . Hu ##ge bath ##tub . So much room . We ordered food and had lots of room to eat . Bo ##ught tickets in advance for the field museum and art institute . Very few people inside . Everyone wore masks . Fe ##lt very safe . We are a family of 6 we got a suite with adjoining room . It was lovely . Would stay again . Thanks again to Olivia made our stay great instead of just two small hotel rooms [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything you want in a hotel - clean rooms , helpful staff , free W ##i ##F ##i , free happy hour beers , great breakfast b ##uff ##et . Super impressed and will definitely be back to stay . Oh yeah , they let you bring dogs too which is awesome [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a pleasant surprise by choosing this hotel . Why ? Mostly from our pleasant check in service to the pleasant and cheerful greeting each and every time we left and returned to the hotel . Even the greeting and pleasant conversation with the door man our made Christmas stay one to remember . Very nice room . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . Great location . I would choose this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked a month ahead and paid extra for a king bed , upon arrival I was informed there were no king beds and I was being placed in a twin bed room which barely fits me at my height , I had to ask for the man ##ger who was kind but only offered a 50 dollar credit for breakfast the next day . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great time , quiet , friendly staff . Location was great , neighborhood was quiet and located wonderful ##ly . N ##eat con ##s ##cie ##nti ##ous rooms with great water pressure and temperatures of water was nice . Will be referring people and also currently planning return trip . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My friend and I came to Illinois for a wedding in Na ##per ##ville and planned to spend a day exploring Chicago . We somehow scored an amazing deal on a double bed room for the night and it did NO ##T di ##sa ##pp ##oint . The hotel was simply stunning . It was perfect walking distance to Lake Michigan , some cute areas to eat / shop and the Red Line ( at least ! ) . We felt so safe in the neighborhood and it was a B ##EA ##UT ##IF ##U ##L area . Bree ( or B ##rie ? ) at the front desk made us feel welcome from the moment we checked in , she was so persona ##ble and kind ! : ) We will absolutely look to stay here the next time we visit Chicago ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] My stay with H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago was a great experience . The location was on par located in downtown near everything ! The room was very comfortable with a TV the size of a wall ! The room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable . The food & drink in the bar was delicious ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just in town for the day and night , so thought I would s ##p ##lu ##rge at the She ##rato ##n Grand . So I was pleasant ##ly surprised when I found the rate was extremely reasonable , and got a large room and great service to boot . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay here . The view was un ##beat ##able . and room was spacious and comfortable . If you ' re staying in Chicago for any reason , the Fair ##mont is an excellent choice . There are a few things to be aware of though . While the food in the hotel restaurant , the Columbus Ta ##p , was very good ( as was the service ) the acoustic ##s in the dining room are terrible . There doesn ' t seem to be anything to dead ##en the sound , so it bounce ##s and gets loud - even with a light crowd at lunch ##time . Don ' t get me wrong , I ' ll very likely stay here next time I am back in Chicago . It was overall a good experience and a good value . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a wonderful time . The front desk and room service were friendly . Room ##s were exceptionally clean . You cannot better than this location on the river and Michigan avenue . Bed ##s were really comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Talbot in December 2019 . I honestly can ' t say enough about Gene ( Con ##cier ##ge ) . . . he made our trip so much more memorable . He is un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly helpful , kind and friendly . I wish every con ##cier ##ge was like him and we would return to the Talbot for him alone . We brought him dinner one night because he was so helpful getting us into a restaurant that was " booked " . Terry the bell man was also amazing . He was so polite , helpful and genuinely sweet . Only 1 of 2 elevators were working at the time of our visit and Terry helped us so much with out baggage or just needing to get to our room quickly . The hotel was great , however , the staff , specifically Gene and Terry are the reason we will return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located within walking distance of everything : The Bean , Boat Tours , Water Tax ##i , Fan ##nie May Chocolate , To ##ns of Restaurant ##s & Shop ##s , River Walk … easy walk to Navy Pier but we took the water taxi back as we were tired . I felt very safe walking around near the hotel too . This property is huge , I mean 2 city blocks huge , with a sky ##bridge cross ##walk . We had our annual I ##BE ##W conference here and the meeting conference spaces were huge as well . They have plenty of staff situated in strategic places to help guide you around and say hello , that was a great help as I got lost a few times ! The room was a little dated but very quiet , comfortable , and had plenty of room . I would not be ashamed to recommend friends here and will probably bring my family up sometime to stay for a vacation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie several times and always come back . It is very convenient to both shopping and the business district . They have a happy hour every night , which is good to get a start on the evening and wind down . The rooms are very comfortable and the service is excellent . They now have the advanced check in process , which makes it very convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , friendly and helpful staff , nice location . I ’ ve visited several times and each time my expectations are exceeded . They staff is so friendly and helpful and they get to know you and call you by name . . . impressive ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a g ##em . Have been staying there for 20 years . It ’ s a short walk to the train station and close to everything so you don ’ t need a car . Very relaxing way to see a great American city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was very comfortable in this hotel with noting to s ##po ##il my stay . The location was great for local amenities and attractions . The lakes ##ide and rivers ##ide walks were close by . The room was very spacious and had great views of the river and lake . The staff were welcoming and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I were in Chicago for a Bears game and event . This hotel is top of the line . Great customer service , good food , affordable and beautiful ! I love the on line options for check in and check out . Park ##ing is the only challenge [SEP]
1	[CLS] I think it ’ s location is extraordinary , as well as all the people who works here . But the reception needs some updates , it is a little dark . And it doesn ’ t have stairs ( just the emergency ones and they don ’ t let you use them ) , and I hate elevators . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had 3 reservations for 3 rooms . We travel with grand ##ki ##ds and when they get up they come in our room so they don ' t wake up the others . Must have rooms together . Called 3 times and still were not together when we checked in . Said there wasn ' t anything they could do . Never again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was in a very central location by Lake Michigan and the city centre , although it did not seem to be close to any public transport links . Staff were helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean and quiet [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean and helpful staff . We would rate it higher if we couldn ' t hear the music from the Pub next door late at night . It wasn ' t too disturbing . If you ' re a light sleep ##er it will bother you . We stayed on the 2nd floor . Ke ##pt our blind ##s down since you could see clearly into the offices next door . They allowed us to check in early and let us know that it wasn ' t a room with a good view . We didn ' t mind since we didn ' t plan on spending much time in the room . Great location . Tax ##i ' s on the spot everywhere in Chicago . Would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the Monaco for two nights in early March for a sisters ' reunion . Very at ##ten ##tive , friendly staff and co ##zy hotel . Co ##m ##fy beds , l ##ux towels , good shower . Light breakfast in morning and wine in the evening . Window seats with river and city views in our adjoining rooms . Very pleasant stay . One evening when we missed the wine reception , a staff member sent a bottle of wine to our room : ) . The greeting ##s each evening and help loading and un ##loading were great ! Will definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love staying here every year . It is a beautiful hotel with friendly staff and a wonderful restaurant . It is also central ##ly located near much shopping and other great food choices . The neighborhood is good . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I had outstanding service at this hotel . When I checked in , I was told I had booked two rooms . This was a mistake on my part and the desk staff took the time to figure out the best room and price for me , even with a line of people behind me . This excellent service continued throughout my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I purchased the stay & park package , which was a much better price than other suite style rooms in the area . The rooms were plenty big enough ; friendly , helpful staff & v ##alet ##s ; better than average free breakfast ; excellent location . We had a small issue with the sheets , but house ##keeping fixed it right away . The only other negative was lots of street noise on the 8th floor , but I suppose that comes with the great location . We ' ll definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I have stayed at the Chicago Hilton several times during my collegiate and professional career . Stay ##ing at the Chicago Hilton is one of those memorable experiences that stays with you forever ! The historical setting , the spacious rooms , the wonderful staff and excellent amenities are top notch . Sit ##uated in the heart of " everything " Chicago , you cannot go wrong . This particular trip happened over the Saint Part ##ick ' s Day festivities and the Chicago Hilton was a center of attraction . If you stay at the Chicago Hilton , check out Kitty O ' Shea ##s restaurant for the best Irish am ##bian ##ce in town . If you ever travel to Chicago , you absolutely must stay at the Chicago Hilton ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay was delight ##ful . We had room 90 ##7 which had a great view of the city ##sca ##pe . John Goodman and Ruth helped make the hotel stay better . Upon arrival we were told that the room would be ready in 30 minutes . Two hours later - we were still waiting . John bought my husband a drink and my son had a snack . After discussing it with John and Ruth , we were placed in our room minutes later . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Check in was quick and easy . The staff were very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The rooms were clean and luxurious . Great location ! ! No complaints . We will definitely stay here again on our next Chicago visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted for my daughter ' s 21st birthday / celebration of a concert for our two daughter ' s Christmas gift . Everything was amazing and we had a very memorable time . We would highly recommend a stay and plan to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel and location . Stay ##ed here for work and hotel was close to everything . Got to walk around as everything is close by , water walks , restaurants and bars . Didn ' t spend too much time at the hotel , but had everything i needed . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So disappointed ! An historic hotel that is worthy of more than this . There is nothing positive about this property . Downtown Chicago has so many more hotel properties better than this hotel . Plus when I tried to bring these to the attention of Hilton they couldn ’ t care less . The pictures speak for them se ##lves . A del ##uxe king corner room ? I hate to see the standard room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights in a superior plus co ##rm ##er room in this classic and historic hotel . The location is as good as it gets being located just off the Ma ##g Mile with shops and eat ##eries . The room was large , clean and comfortable . My only regret is that the windows were so dirty that you could hardly look outside - a pit ##ty when the views are great from the high floor corner rooms . Also I missed a hands ##how ##er in the bathroom , only rainforest shower in our room , which I found strange . However , all in all we had a smooth and enjoyable stay , and I would glad ##ly return here in the future . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a night with my husband & 2 children . It was a little intimidating staying here with young kids . Especially since my son can be very c ##rank ##y . But we still made the best out of it . Everything was very clean and com ##fy . The food we ordered was to die for ! Our view was amazing . This was a great hotel for our little Chicago trip . I recommend ordering room service ! Del ##icious . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for a conference ( also at the hotel ) . It was very clean and all the staff were at ##ten ##tive and very kind . The food at the conference after the second day left a lot to be desired as it was rather basic ( pizza , b ##urger ##s ) . The Club on level 35 was excellent . They had a nice selection of fruit , app ##eti ##zers , and drinks throughout the day . The room was functional . But there wasn ' t nearly enough space for 2 people to un ##pack . Water pressure was rather weak in the shower and there was 1 very small counter in the bathroom . The beds were comfortable , but the pillows were a mix of either very firm and barely maneuver ##able or so soft - it - might - as - well - not - be - there . It ' s a decent place if you ' re just using it as a space to sleep ( sort of ) and take care of h ##ygiene . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great nights sleep ! [UNK] Custom ##er service ! ! ! Excellent location too high end [UNK] and very close to Michigan Avenue . [UNK] Room [UNK] took 45 minutes to an hour . However , I think that ’ s because they use an outside service due to Co ##vid . [UNK] I would highly recommend this [UNK] ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a great hotel for our weekend trip to Chicago . A decent walk to the train station to go to Cubs game , or walk other direction to Navy Pier . Dec ##ent bar attached to the Michael Jordan steak ##house . Very comfortable bed , decent size room . Pro tip - that star ##bu ##cks in the lobby can get pretty long lines early . Right across from there is the Lab ##rio ##la it ##alia ##n restaurant and early morning they also have Stan ' s don ##uts and coffee , it ' s not that crowded earlier in the morning to get a quick cup of coffee . The only down ##side to this hotel was the elevator was a little slow at times , and we were only on the 3rd floor but they didn ' t have an easy stairway access , but I still thought it was worth a 5th star . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was impressed by the whole staff and would highly recommend Chicago Hilton as they were simply excellent . In particular , there was an employee named Julius Do ##xy who recognized that I was frustrated and took the appropriate action right away . It is the little things that count that make the difference in the end . Great stuff , Julius . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here one night for some fun in the city . N ##est ##led in the middle of the River North area you are within walking distance to all things great for what the city has to offer . Short rides to anything else . Park ##ing is right next to the hotel which in this town is hard to find . Beautiful and very very clean hotel at an amazing price . The staff was very professional , friendly and on point from door ##man to manager . Order ##ed a bottle of wine from their large selection for a night cap ; which was delivered promptly . They also have an amazing free happy hour with beer and wine at the bar from 6 - 7 ##pm . . . . . . in Chicago . My new favorite place to stay when visiting . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel is one we will come back to many times , since one of my children moved to Chicago . It is in the heart of everything , right near the red line and convenient to the whole city . The staff goes out of their way to make you happy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ser ##or is an amazing bartender ! A true artist with alcohol ! ! Best bartender in Chicago ! Black ##berry ma ##rga ##rita to es ##press ##o ma ##rt ##ini ##s , take your pick ! The hotel is in a prime location to everything ! Close to the river , Mill ##eni ##um park & the lake front [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l this weekend so we could lock down some vendors for our wedding next year ( at the Swiss ##ote ##l ) . Veronica the catering sales manager has made everything sea ##m ##less . She also setup our tasting with Chef Lulu for our wedding menu . Chef Lulu is a rock star - - such amazing food . We are really ps ##ych ##ed ! The rooms are always great here , and the location is optimal for anything in the city of Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel should be perfect . It ’ s a classic building with some unique architects and features . However , it is completely un ##usa ##ble . One of the elevators is permanently out of order so the waits for the elevator at peak times can exceed 25 - 30 minutes . Absolutely into ##ler ##able . The rooms and bathroom ##s are also so tiny as to be imp ##ractical . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I picked the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel for the location and it ' s good reviews . We were out in Chicago to celebrate my husband ' s 40th surprise birthday weekend . I had called the hotel prior to arriving and Drake , the con ##cier ##ge , helped me find a restaurant to host the party . He also hung a hand ##made birthday banner by my kids , ordered balloons , and beers for the room . My husband was really surprised when we arrived in the room . The hotel was clean , very nice staff , great continental breakfast , and a perfect location ! I will 100 % stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie hotel when we are in Chicago . Drake and his team went above and beyond their duties to make this weekend extra special for our family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is beautiful . It is a classic hotel and the longest continuously operating hotel in North America . We almost didn ' t stay there based on reviews . It is old . If you expect open , air ##y contemporary hotel , this is not for you . The rooms and bathroom ##s are smaller , but they are decorated in style . It is central ##ly located to theaters and restaurants . We saw a play , went to dinner and then went to the hotel bar , Potter ' s , to welcome the new year ( they do not host a new year ' s party ) . Even though the bar in the hotel didn ' t officially stay open past midnight , we stayed past 1 ##am on New Year ' s eve and the staff continued to provide friendly service . I would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was amazing except for house ##keeping . Out of four days our room was only well cleaned and re ##su ##pp ##lie ##d once . Otherwise , best hotel experience ever . Great sleep , food , fitness room , location , staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In the city for a romantic weekend . This hotel is an excellent renovation of the old Shrine ##rs hotel - - really solid construction in a great location right on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping street . The must - see part of the old hotel is the indoor swimming pool : be sure to bring your swim ##sui ##t and plan to hang out in the warm seating area . They spent considerable effort keeping the be ##au ##iti ##ful old tile ##work and f ##rie ##zes . A thoughtful con ##cier ##ge was on duty : we requested and received a larger room , and she also responded a ##pol ##og ##etic ##ally to our website comment about the street noise ( note that Michigan Avenue apparently hosts informal motorcycle rallies on the weekend ! Now that ' s unexpected customer service . The bed ##ding and bathroom were all top ##not ##ch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has many strengths but a major weakness . If you are booking through a company you are required to have the booking card with you and then to pay as you arrive . This means that if you are being booked by a third party or your employer the hotel will ignore these instructions as well as letters confirming payments and phone calls . I have had multiple problems with the reception at this hotel and recommend you book somewhere else . Without the problems at reception this hotel would have been a three star . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 5 nights at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the stay . The staff were very friendly and at ##ten ##tive to any requests ( we asked for a mini - f ##rig ) . I went running in the mornings and when I came b ##ak to the hotel the bell ##man hands me a hand towel and bottle of water . Close to everything . Mill ##eni ##um Park right across the street . The Miracle Mile shopping / restaurant two blocks away and Chicago River a block away . If it ' s a nice day , try walking to the museum section . It ' s a little o ##v ##wer a mile and about a 30 minute walk . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location to see everything by foot , or a quick car ride to anything else . Am ##eni ##ties are b ##ou ##nti ##ful between the two " towers " . The staff from the moment you walk ##up to the moment you leave , were so helpful and made my stay quite enjoyable . Fun tips as you walk down the hallway ##s , I even saw some staff members help guest across the walkway who appeared to have had a lot of " spirits " from one of many restaurants or bars within walking distance . Great views of the river and beautiful architecture . The West Tower rooms and halls are a little dated and may have a smell . House ##keeping kept me on my toes with the wake ##up knocks and on schedule as it was easy to sleep well into the morning with the black ##out curtains ! Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were here for 5 nights and only have great things to say about this place . The location is spot on and walking distance from most of the tourist ##y stuff . Also in close proximity to Tango , one of the best places to have breakfast . The rooms are just brilliant . Mass ##ive in size and very taste ##fully done . Bath ##rooms are huge themselves and well appointed . The front desk was approach ##able and the general service great . If in Chicago , put this on your short list . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is central ##ly located in downtown . We could walk everywhere . The room was very nice . The staff was excellent . Drake at the desk and F ##ais ##al , the bell ##man , were especially helpful . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary evening reception was a chance to un ##wind and have a glass of wine before dinner . The breakfast was fine , very good past ##ries , but I would have like to see an un ##s ##weet ##ened cereal choice . We enjoyed the candy treats in the reception area . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was in a great location to Navy Pier , staff were helpful but un ##friend ##ly . Bring your wallet ! ! ! The hotel bar charged us 30 $ for two jack and co ##kes . Hotel breakfast area charged us 14 $ for a diet Coke and Star ##bu ##cks m ##och ##a in a can . Nice place just don ' t eat or drink there . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I loved my experience and I would recommend this to everyone ! The staff was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , anything that I requested from the staff didn ' t take more than 15 minutes . I would tell anyone that asks that Home ##wood Suite ##s are the best option . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I attended a conference in this hotel . First time I ’ ve stayed there . I highly recommend it ! The rooms were clean , spacious and comfortable . Good safety tip — my room included a flashlight ( why don ’ t all hotels do this ? ) . The front desk staff is at ##ten ##tive , cheerful and helpful . My only note for improvement ? Breakfast in The Palm is expensive and just ok / average . Also not particularly speed ##y if you ’ re in a rush . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For people who want or need to prepare their own meals , this is an excellent choice . The location is close to everything , with a Jewel - O ##sco supermarket just a block away , a Trade ##r Joe ' s about two blocks away , and the ups ##cale Eat ##alia Italian market on the same block . The staff is extremely friendly and eager to please . The only thing I suggest is that they add a measuring cup set , a measuring spoon set , and a pair of kitchen s ##cis ##sors to each room ' s kitchen equipment . But I ' ve seen this at several Home ##woods , and I try to take measuring cups and measuring spoon ##s with me when I go there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoy Home ##wood Suite ##s by Hilton for travel because of the apartment like nature of the rooms . Sometimes I don ' t feel like eating out and having the option to prepare a meal in the kitchen is a nice option or when I do eat out , the option to bring food back to the room and keep it until the next day . The free breakfast is also nice . The location of this hotel is very convenient . Close to the Red Line , a block away from shops along the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , restaurants , etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 8 days while travelling for work . The full kitchen and larger sized rooms were fantastic and very comfortable . The breakfast and evening receptions were more than adequate . The breakfast was a great way to start our long work days and the evening receptions were a nice touch to be able to wind down after crazy busy days . The staff was very at ##ten ##tive and helpful with our requests . A super awesome shout out to our new friend Am ##er - he had our vehicle waiting for us everyday . He made our stay so enjoyable and we look forward to staying at this hotel next year when we are back in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great stay at H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago for a conference . Con ##ven ##ient location , great options for dining within and around hotel . Staff very friendly . Room quiet and comfortable . I would happily stay there again ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el was magnificent indeed . Perfect location , central ##ly located to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile as well as the Loop , with many fantastic dining options nearby . The room was f ##abulous with the signature feather ##top bed and designer toilet ##ries , a lovely size . ( Ask for a corner room ) There was an option for house ##keeping not to come and clean the room , and you could get $ 10 back . Co ##mp ##lim ##ent ##ary tea & coffee making facilities for the guests downtown available 24 ##hr ##s . We stayed at another hotel on Ma ##g Mile , but would definitely return to the So ##fit ##el in the future . High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I were in Chicago from Atlanta to see “ Hamilton ” and chose this hotel as it seemed quite central ##ly located . We are SP ##G ( Star ##wood Pre ##ferred Guest ) members and generally try to stay in a Star ##wood ( now owned by Mar ##riot ##t ) hotel . The She ##rato ##n Grand turned out to be a great choice ! Our room was clean , great hotel amenities and friendly staff . We utilized the con ##cier ##ge services a lot and found La ##to ##ya particularly knowledge ##able and helpful . The view from our room on the 30th floor was spectacular ! High ##ly recommended this hotel whenever you ’ re in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not sure where to start . Room was a 2 bed 2 bath listed a " hip and historic " de ##cor . It should have said " tired and worn a ##2 star hotel de ##cor " . Room did not have a coffee pot . One bathroom had no hot water . The other had a stopped up drain in the shower . There was no room service menu . There was a tablet that was fully discharged which took an hour to get enough power to boot up . I ' m guessing that a room service might have been available there . . . . but . . . . the thing has both front and rear cameras on it . H ##OW CR ##EE ##P ##Y IS T ##HA ##T ? CA ##ME ##RA ##S CO ##N ##NE ##CT ##ED TO THE H ##OT ##EL NE ##T ##W ##OR ##K IN THE R ##O ##OM . And the main rest ##ua ##rant appears to be an after ##th ##ought . It is c ##ram ##med into several side rooms . No am ##bian ##ce and the food is me ##dio ##cre at best . I will not be returning . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The room and the staff were extremely nice and stood up to my expectations of an O ##m ##ni hotel . The one disappointment was the v ##alet staff downstairs . When getting out of my cab , no one offered me assistance getting my bags or helping me upstairs to check in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful lobby . . small rooms , odd TV placement , extremely cold bathroom with no heat vent , extremely slow elevators that didn ’ t always work properly . . . walls are very thin , could hear every word being said in one adjacent room ( at 4 : 30 in the morning ) and the constant ya ##pping of the dog in the other adjacent room . . . complained more than once about constant barking but nothing was done about it . Not a rest ##ful place to stay , look elsewhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything that you need . E ##ff ##ort ##less stay . A step up from Mar ##riot ##t or H ##ya ##tt . ( Sorry ! ) . Large room size . No heavy down comfort ##er to make you [UNK] sweat - Thank you ! Cool elevator system and great location . I ’ d love to go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is truly a wonderful hotel . The staff are it ’ s greatest asset . Erin M . at the front desk and David the con ##cier ##ge were especially helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The lobby is wonderful , full of beautiful no ##ok ##s and c ##ran ##nies where a Dad can work while his family occupies the room . There is ample public space , and I never saw them run out of it even when the lobby was very crowded on Saturday evening . We have stayed in Chicago in April for the last four years , and this is our favorite hotel . The rooms and suites are beautiful and they will accommodate by adding microwave ##s and refrigerator ##s if needed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at the Conrad Chicago . The staff is very nice and helpful . Our room was so clean and nice . The bathroom was amazing with the huge shower , light up mirror and double sink van ##ity . The lights were on an automatic switch which was very good . The TV was huge . At ##ten ##tion was paid to all the details ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel with excellent location to stores and restaurants . Clean room . Room a little noisy be ##aca ##use it faced the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Bed was good but not great . The mattress felt a little worn out . Air condition worked great [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family of 4 stayed at the O ##m ##ni for the first time for 3 nights . Room was clean and spacious . The beds were comfortable - king , sofa bed , and roll ##away . The staff was so helpful and kind . We will definitely stay here again . Perfect location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is situated close to most Chicago tourist attractions , however , parking is a headache . The front desk staff at check in were excellent ( pleasant and inviting ) , however , at check ##out they seemed non ##chal ##ant . The room was okay , the clean ##liness was not up to par with other H ##ya ##tt properties and they didn ’ t re ##ple ##nish the amenities ( s ##ham ##po ##o , condition ##er and body wash ) to accommodate 2 adults and 2 children . Overall the property is well situated . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Always . . . . clean , comfortable , lots of amenities , plenty to do , friendly staff ( down to the random j ##ani ##tor , repair guy and garage attendant ##s ) , a ##cco ##mo ##dating , and great views ( city , park or lake ) . Wonderful spa / services . Easy to stay in all weekend or go out on the town day or night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is smack in the heart of town surrounded by shopping , tours and restaurants . The hotel staff , as expected from o ##m ##ni , are first class . We had lovely connecting rooms and our teenagers had a quiet ##er time than us - our room had great views over the magnificent mile , however this turned out to be the main route for emergency services and we found the sire ##ns really disturbing at night . Kids said they heard nothing - their room was facing different direction . I would definitely recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean . Friendly staff . Full Hot Breakfast is great and evening social is equally nice . Close to Navy Pier and Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . Free Navy Pier Shuttle stop is just outside the hotel doors on the corner ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel at 500 + per night is no a luxury hotel , in fact it ’ s nothing more than a Hampton Inn or Co ##m ##fort Inn at best . Pro 1 . Dec ##ent furniture 2 . Ok location Con ##s 1 . Over priced ( 500 + / night ) 2 . No executive lounge 3 . Am ##eni ##ties don ’ t always work 4 . 15 dollar credit daily for food and the restaurants barely had stuff for 15 dollars 5 . Over h ##ype ##d roof top bar 6 . Custom ##er service sucked 7 . Very , very small rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , quiet , customer service is excellent . I was in Chicago for interviews and this is the hotel I was put up in . Easy access to all the amenities downtown Chicago has to offer . The restaurant and lounge were super , food excellent , wait staff took care of every need . A must place to stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful . Pro ##s : Take time to have a drink in the lobby bar . Beautiful atmosphere . Friendly bartender ##s and good drinks . It is located within walking distance of the theater district , parks and the Art Institute of Chicago , Subway ( Red line ) is a fast easy trip to W ##rig ##ley . Limited choices at night for bars but it is just a 5 to 7 dollar U ##ber to sections of town with more choices . Con ##cier ##ge was helpful and booked a boat cruise for us . House ##keeping staff was very friendly . Con ##s : limited room service and extremely slow response time when trying to get an operator ( I waited for close to 3 minutes for the phone to be picked up ) . Overall , a nice stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t has an incredibly friendly and helpful staff . They went above and beyond for us . The room was large and the beds very comfortable . A great stay . Easy access to the L and walking distance to many things . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I wanna pay a special thank you to the con ##cier ##ge staff , Paula , Marina , who provided useful information upon request , and Stan and Joe ( who was on duty on 9th Jan . ) who offered me to fix my ties . One caution for future tenants of ex ##ec suits , however , is that , don ' t remove any beverages in the mini fridge , unless you want to buy that item . Me ##re taking it outside the fridge would trigger their electronic system and you ' ll have to pay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for a weekend get ##away . I really can ' t understand the negative reviews . Yes , it ' s an older property but it ' s taste ##ful and clean . For me what really stood out was the staff . Every person I encountered was eager to please and friendly . Great bar and lobby area . Super com ##fy bed . I would stay here again when I ' m in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el of Chicago is always a great stay , and you are treated as a guest should be ! ! ! Plus , the staff there is friendly , a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and do a fantastic job at making their guests comfortable and p ##amp ##ered . Would always recommend . R ##t [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel has a great location , you are close to many of downtown attractions . I ran the Chicago Marathon , and it is also a very convenient location to the start co ##rra ##ls of the marathon . The bed is fair , as for a hotel like this you will except an exceptional room with a nice bed , but you won ' t get it here . Also the standard room is very small compared to other hotels near this one . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The food at all restaurants is great from the ha ##mb ##urger ##s to the steak ##s you can ’ t go wrong . The Big Bar serves great classic drinks and wonderful specialty drinks . The employees are super nice and the rooms are always clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d that they had the pack - n - play available for the baby - and the breakfast to make meal time easier to get out the door before a fun - filled day of activities ! Having a kitchen helped , too ! We enjoy having a suite for the bedroom separation for the kids as well . Downs ##ide - you will have to wait for the elevator a lot . . . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A lot of people will mention the location for their main reason for staying here , but for me what make ##a this hotel special is the customer service . Every morning for breakfast and each night for the evening social we were greeted with a smile by an amazing young man named Jeremy . Jeremy went above and beyond any restaurant service I ' ve ever received . While the hotel was very busy he made sure our family had everything we needed for every meal . Whether it was getting my daughter some more orange juice or finding some more banana ##s that were in the back room , Jeremy was there for us . Words can ' t describe how he made us feel like family during our stay . As long as he is working at Home ##wood Suite ##s by Hilton , I will be staying there for every visit to Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##ing with a large group for color guard competition and had a great experience ! D ##wayne , Charles , and Angie were all amazing ! All hotel staff were very nice and helpful . 35 + people in our group and no complaints ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location , very close to Hancock building , in a historic building that preserves the old fashion Chicago ambient . The room is not so big ( standard room ) , but very clean and comfortable , as well as the bathroom . The bad thing is represented by the reception ##ist , they are not adequate for a hotel of this standard . . . horrible experience , they woke me up at 7 am asking for my credentials , While they have it already , after 5 days staying , asking me to make the check out . . . . 2 days before the end of our staying . NO ##BO ##D ##Y AP ##OL ##O ##GI ##Z ##E for this . Is better for the same price to choose a different hotel in the ma ##g mile , having so a better treatment . Quite good the restaurant to have a breakfast ( compliment to Alex ) . [SEP]
0	[CLS] A great historic building with all the modern amenities . The staff was very friendly and the room was top notch . A very nice hotel and I wish we could have stayed longer to experience more of what it has to offer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] For a hotel in downtown Chicago , the rooms are pretty spacious , except for the bathroom ##s . The bathroom ##s were pretty tight , but there is a locker room in the fitness center that guests could also use if needed . The fitness center was pretty nice that could rival a small gym . The location is great , next to the " L " and only a couple of blocks from Millennium Park . There are also several places to grab a quick bite as you head out for your activities . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room , staff and amenities were top notch . It is right in the center of Down Town Chicago with plenty to do within a short walk . If you ' re visiting the convention center for business , a cab / ride share will be necessary but not a has ##sle . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A historic hotel with o ##oz ##ed charm located in the heart of Chicago , closes to a lot of attractions . Common areas are very well appointed while rooms are little small , dark and not as nice . Overall , it is a comfortable experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It does have a neat style and a good location but a few things are a bit of a turn ##off . The room is small by US standards but still comfortable . They charge for w ##if ##i , and the rest ##room doors have an uncomfortably large gap in the middle since they are double doors so make sure you are comfortable with your roommate . Overall there is a little wear but not bad . My major complaint is that the house ##keeping is a bit la ##x . I found toe ##nail clip ##ping ##s on the floor of the room and hair in various places in the rest ##room . The front desk said they would inform the head of house ##keeping when I made them aware of it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel is really well situated next to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent mile and very handy to access downtown Chicago . The subway is pretty close and there are many good quality restaurants and bars nearby . However , as a central city location you do get the inherent noises of such a place , we could hear the subway at night and the bin men start early . The staff were very friendly and very helpful and the in - house restaurant / bar serves good quality food and drinks . The room was well equipped and very clean . Would definitely go back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] So , still here , however had to tell everyone how much I love this hotel . The commitment to excellence is un ##mat ##ched . I have a p ##eanut all ##er ##gy , I ordered room service via text and the bill had in large words . P ##EA ##NU ##T AL ##LE ##R ##G ##Y . Yes ! The care is incredible ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Re ##com ##men ##d staying here . Pool is great for kids and adults but my kids ( 8 and 12 ) loved it . Staff was friendly . Room ##s were clean . Location good and you can walk to many nearby shops like water tower place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent Hotel , perfect location , great service , great people . I recommend 100 % your stay always at So ##fit ##el Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mill ##e in Chicago . Excellent environment . Nice ##ly decorated rooms , lobby , bar and restaurant with a nice gym to exercise , and a center for business . The restaurant has great French Mediterranean cuisine 24 hours with room service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Whenever I am in Chicago , I always try to stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l downtown . I have stayed there on 6 occasions and have never had a bad experience . The staff is always professional and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the dining and lounge ##s are second to none . I will def ##inate ##ly stay there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Chicago Fair ##mont is not up to the normal Fair ##mont standards . The hotel was beautifully decorated for the holidays . However the hotel rooms are in dire need of up ##dating and cleaning . Con ##ven ##ient to the Lake , park and Michigan Ave . staff is generally friendly . Good level morning staff less friendly than the evening staff . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Regency for the Chicago Marathon . Good location for the Start / Fin ##ish lines . Very helpful staff . No one was just standing around killing time - they were engaged with the hotel guests and seemed to enjoy their work . The staff is the difference between a good place to stay and a great place to stay - the staff was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stated here with an infant and had a very nice stay . Room ##s have been renovated and are very spacious and clean . We had a room next to the elevator and did not hear very much outside noise . Great location , could walk to lots of shopping and restaurants . We enjoyed a coffee and desert at the hotel bar and it was a very nice experience . Only draw ##back was expensive hotel parking so we parked down the street at a garage for half the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In ##vi ##ted to a wedding here , we enjoyed our stay . . . . . Re ##mo ##del ##ed from its former self , and under the K ##lim ##pton name , it hangs well in the neighborhood . The Ball ##room and wa ##ln ##ut rooms were pleasant and handled 160 guests pretty well . The cocktail ##s room was somewhat cramped and very noisy , but there were . Number of smaller areas to chat in , away from the crowd . One major draw ##back was the location of the rest ##rooms - wa ##aa ##aa ##aa ##y across the hotel lobby and down a hallway , past the front desk . . . . . . Very in ##con ##ven ##ient and mixed the wedding party guests with hotel guests . . . . Worth consideration if in that area ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel on the river in the center of downtown . Close to many attractions in Chicago . Clean , very nice service . Beautiful views from the rooms of the City and Navy Pier . A large gym and two restaurants . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed here for a quick Chicago trip . The location couldn ' t be better , with the hotel being a half a block from the Michigan Ave . We were able to walk to nearly all of our desired destinations and save on u ##ber fare ##s . The rooms are huge for a Chicago hotel since they are all suites . Super clean and taste ##fully decorated . We loved the views from the 16th floor . All of the staff we encountered were super friendly and helpful . Will definitely stay again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Give it some time for the growing pains to be over if you are a Global ##ist and make sure you check your bill for er ##rone ##ous charges . Service in the restaurant is horrible and multiple charges made to bill that should not have been included with no notice and no update of f ##olio after stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was amazing and the view was incredible . However the room was furnished with cheap furniture that went way below the standards of the Hilton Hotels . Bed was hard and uncomfortable , the couch was a pull out and the cushion ##s were so thin you could feel the springs and the temperature you couldn ’ t control no matter what you did . . up or down with the te ##mp and nothing happens either it was too cold or too hot . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We did an overnight stay on the mile for my son ' s 11th birthday . The hotel staff made us feel like we were their only guests . They provided a home base that meet and exceeded our every need . They were able to have the room ready about 5 hours early and we v ##alet ##ed the car for long enough to spend two days in Chicago . When the Sky ##de ##ck threw off our plans they even kept the car an extra few hours for free . When we came back to the room there as even a little birthday cake for my son . I can ' t give the staff any higher compliment ##s ! They made us feel like family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time at this hotel . Breakfast food good . Staff in restaurant efficient but rat her abrupt and to as friendly as should be . Table of four and all thought the same . G ##ym not very big and some bits not working . Bed ##room very comfortable though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] As usual , we loved our recent stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel in Chicago last weekend . The room was more comfortable than most other places I ' ve stayed in the city , and you can ' t beat the location . Service was excellent . We went next door to the Public House restaurant - cool place with good food & drinks - and we ' re pleased to find we got 20 % off our bill because we stayed at the Ki ##nz ##ie . Looking forward to our next stay already ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Total ##ly loved this hotel . Compared to a NYC hotel , the room was huge . This hotel had the best work out room of any hotel I have stayed in - top floor , tons of equipment and great view , with smooth ##ies and spa water . What a treat for a work out junk ##ie . The location was great - near the river front and lake and more . I would stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Jewel in the heart of Chicago - lobby is outstanding as are shops such as Me ##rz . Ling ##er for a cocktail and take in the am ##bian ##ce . Room ##s are comfortable and the facilities are unique and welcoming . Staff are professional and helpful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed on a business trip last week and the Fair ##mont was perfect . A great works ##pace for me to answer my emails , pro ##mpt room service with excellent food , and all of the staff were so friendly . I ' ll be staying here when I return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very helpful and the rooms were t ##idy , clean and spacious . . the reading no ##ok ##s are a great feature . Didn ' t get a chance to use the bikes or attend happy hour but both seem like they ' d be fun on a future stay . . . If I was going to critique a few things , it would be that the t ##v in the room had poor image quality and the on demand feature was pretty much in ##ac ##cess ##ible due to this . Also , the restaurant tends to end breakfast a bit early and the lunch menu looks nothing like br ##unch so that was a bit of an annoyance . One shouldn ' t be expected to be up and eating breakfast before 10 am while on vacation . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love the location of this small , bout ##ique hotel . The Ki ##nz ##ie is reasonably priced for its location . I have stayed there several times and enjoy the happy hours with free drinks and app ##eti ##zers . The free small continental breakfast on each floor is also convenient . I recommended this hotel to my sister - in - law who has traveled all over the world and she enjoyed it tremendous ##ly too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 3 nights . Room was quiet and Co ##m ##fort ##able . You fell welcomed , this hotel is pet friendly . Nice touch - Pro ##se ##cco served from 5 - 6 in lobby , which makes for a nice get together and has a f ##estive atmosphere . The elevators doors and lobby have a nice art de ##co feel . The hotel is nicely located in the loop in them ##iddle of the theater district and close to many attractions and to a train station so you can litter ##ally walk from the station . The carpet ##ing is bit worn down so could use an ##nu ##p ##grade but overall would recommend this hotel if the price is right for you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay here every year for a couple of weeks and I could not be happier with the quality of the staff and the facility . The v ##alet staff is second to none , very friendly . Angel in the bar will make sure you get first class service every time . [SEP]
0	[CLS] As the person who had the pleasure on partner ##ing with ACC ##OR on the lighting distribution it was an honor and a privilege to work with ACC ##OR threw Fred Lot ##t . I hope to be able to do business threw lighting design and lighting distribution of up and coming properties . Thank You too ACC ##OR for the opportunity . T ##ruly , J ##EF ##F ##RE ##Y M .

1	[CLS] Great location , with a very friendly and professional staff . Love staying at the She ##rato ##n when I ' m visiting downtown Chicago . The She ##rato ##n Grand has above average food and beverage offerings and is within walking distance of navy pier , shopping and more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There are many better hotels for similar money . . . House ##keeping , front desk and door ##men were excellent and it ' s a convenient location . Air conditioning was absolutely terrible - the room was around 70 ##F and we had to call down to ask for a fan ! That ' s a big fail in my books . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I were in Chicago for 24 hours as we made our way home to California . This was the perfect hotel with an incredible location . It ' s on the Chicago River and close to the waterfront , Michigan Mile , Restaurant ##s , Mill ##eni ##um Park , She ##d A ##qua ##rium and more . More than enough to occupy a week much less a day . Room was comfortable and clean . All the staff we ran into were friendly and happy to help . Kids loved the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel was an excellent place for the nonprofit board meeting that we held there . The meeting services were very good . The hotel was comfortable and well run . The location was convenient . And best of all , since we are a nonprofit , the price was very reasonable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The housekeeper Tracy was so friendly and helpful . She knew what I needed before I asked ! ! ! She has a southern flavor , which was great as I ’ m from Alabama and she from Mississippi ! ! ! ! Give her a raise ! ! ! ! Oh yeah , the rooms and hotel were great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed on the 5th floor and had a view of Navy Pier . The room was clean and beautiful and if you want , they ’ ll give you a $ 10 / day credit if you skip the daily room cleaning . That ’ s a nice option . I ’ d skip the lobby restaurant because it ’ s super expensive . Instead grab a great cup of coffee and find a nearby place to eat . There is no shortage of good food in Chicago . Our friends upgraded and they got a corner room high up - those views were incredible ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Stay every year for FA ##ST . L ##O ##VE T ##H ##IS place ! Everyone enjoys their stay here . The ballroom is elegant , and very g ##rac ##ious to all involved . Our special needs kids always feel welcome . That ' s very important to us ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just went there a few days ago for business and the experience was great . Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful . The room is very spacious and clean . Fr ##idge is available upon request with no extra charges . The location is great , very close to Michigan Ave , where all the brand name stores are ; Whole Food and Trade ##r Joe ' s are only a 10 - 15 min ##s walk . Lo ##ads of restaurants nearby , and Te ##mpo Café is just around the corner and it opens 24 hours in case if you get in late or have a super early morning flight to catch : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice to be greeted at the desk in French . I guess this must be a tradition at all So ##fit ##els . This was my first stay at a So ##fit ##el and it didn ' t di ##sa ##pp ##oint . Friendly check in , room was clean , modern , a ta ##d small but that ' s okay . I was in for a conference . I didn ' t use the amenities so can ' t comment . Had breakfast in the restaurant . Order ##ed the eggs ben ##ny . One egg was medium the other was well done so clearly one was sitting on stand ##by in the kitchen . Otherwise , stay was good , location central , and I would stay again . Price was reasonable , booked through the conference organizers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed at the Fair ##mont Mill ##eni ##um Park for the past 6 years for our family Christmas in Chicago weekend . We rent suites and take advantage of the Gold Room on the 15th floor for breakfast and snack ##s . High ##ly recommend the Fair ##mont for quality service and access to nearby Mill ##eni ##um Park . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Katrina is everything a business travel ##er hopes for when needing assistance . Many thanks for her professional , grace - filled services . She and her colleagues are why I stay at The Conrad . Everything on point , as always . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed last week of March for my birthday . The property is a good location for the tourist reasons to visit Chicago , easy walking distance to parks , museums , restaurants , Michigan Ave , etc . What made this a great stay was treatment by all the staff . Alex and She ##ryl at the con ##cier ##ge desk , Mu ##gi , Cody , Sharon , Man ##dan ##a , and T ##ip ##hani in the Gold Room , hostess and servers in the Ta ##p . All were extremely kind and gave great advice on things to do and places to go . They all seemed to enjoy their jobs and helping people . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked a del ##uxe room and requested a view of Grant Park where lo ##lla ##pal ##oo ##za was . It was a 15 minute walk to the main entrance of the music f ##est . Yes , it does have a little wear and tear but it ' s a nice hotel . quick check in and out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always stay at the Monaco when we are in Chicago . It ' s a combination of the friendly , helpful staff , the great location , the fun de ##cor of the rooms , and the clean ##liness . We feel as though the staff is more than just doing their jobs , they are building relationships with guests . The door men , especially Antonio and Michael , recognize us every time we stay and make us feel welcome from the moment we arrive . Whether we are there on business or a weekend get ##away , the Monaco perfectly fits our needs and always lives up to our expectations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##ing experience . Room was clean . But overall hotel was lacking . Quite dated , felt s ##hab ##by . Check ##ing in felt like being in a train station , with a long line cord ##oned off by ropes . Color scheme and de ##cor muted and dated . Just didn ’ t feel like a 4 star hotel at all . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our family of 7 decided to head into Chicago for an evening to see the Christmas lights , and found a great rate at the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago ! Beautiful hotel , right along the river ! Indoor pool for kids / teenagers , as well as a Star ##bu ##cks . Quick fast check in , and elevators always available ! Plan on spending quite a bit for parking , but otherwise , a great hotel if you want to spend the weekend exploring downtown Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location - convenient to everything . Walking distance to many attractions . Great view from room - parking was close by and check in and out was really easy . Would definitely stay here again . Will recommend to friends - family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The reason I say a bit old is because it ’ s a bit ran down and dated . The beds are com ##fy . There were two big chairs in the room but no table to set coffee on . But yet the desk area was really big but unless you ’ re working who needs it ? I think in inter ##continent ##al hotel should have more up - to - date amenities like newer lamps And USB plug ##s . The location is really good . [SEP]
0	[CLS] As usual , these hotels in the A ##cco ##r chain exhibit the highest class and service . The hotel is in a nice area and very easy to get around by foot or by transportation . The staff are very professional and court ##eous . They ensure everything is perfect for your trip . Now that we ' re in a post - pan ##de ##mic , they ensure everything is clean and safe . The room I stayed in was very comfortable and has a nice view of the city . And you have ample space to work or to use your personal computer to check online for attractions you may wish to visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Millennium K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for 2 nights ( 9 / 15 to 9 / 17 ) . I booked a Superior Room and was very disappointed with the Hotel . My room smelled bad , the AC system was too loud and every time that it went on I woke up . The carpet was dirty and stained and various spots . The Hotel which is considered a 4 ST ##AR property does not offer room service . Mini bar selections were cheap and just a few . If you are looking for a great location go forward but if you are looking for a 4 Star Hotel please avoid this place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An early 1900 feel all throughout the hotel until you reach your room , where you ' re now in 2016 . Excellent renovations for the rooms and quality . 5 out of 5 . Location is amazing too . A bit p ##ric ##y , but you ' re paying for the best service and room , as well as location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was beyond impressed with this hotel & their staff . They were so welcoming to my daughters & I from the minute I arrived to the minute we left . They were friendly & more than helpful on every occasion . I honestly haven ’ t experienced hospitality like this in quite some time . The American Girl package was quite a deal & my girls were treated as if they were special guests . They loved every minute of their stay here . I would highly recommend this hotel & will definitely be returning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had the pleasure of staying here 2 nights in June for a work event . It made me realize why so many people visit my hometown . The views were f ##abulous . There is access to the River ##walk right across the street . The bed was very com ##fy and I ' m pretty pick ##y . Small but nice health club . I plan to spend a non working weekend there in the fall . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Was here on business , their Pro ##se ##cco hour makes this the best hotel ever ! Leah was the best out of everyone , and ni ##ck as well , we were here with a group and they treated us better than any other hotel ! Thanks ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] No complaint at check - in and room was very clean . We checked in at 6 : 30 Friday night and left at 9 : 15 am . Pa ##id by credit card upon arriving . Next morning I am presented with a bill for about $ 25 for Am ##eni ##ties . I went down to let them know we did enjoy any amenities in our short stay except for drinks and app ##eti ##zer night before . I was told the charge was because we booked through an online web ##sight and not the hotel . This is a de ##ce ##it ##ful business practice . Should be told this at check - in . I will not be staying at this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked this hotel on the recommendation of a friend . She was right ! A ##wes ##ome location , super close to shopping and sites . Great room with updated amenities . Wonderful view and extremely friendly staff . You will not be disappointed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed two nights for a business trip . Court ##eous staff and clean rooms . The elevators are super fast so you never have to wait long . Location is great and if you get a south - facing room , it has a nice view of the Chicago river and the river ##walk . It ' s an easy walk to the Navy Pier to see Lake Michigan , or the magnificent mile on Michigan Ave . There ' s a nice Whole Foods market only a block away and wonderful variety of restaurants all around . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The service was excellent rooms with great view and con ##cier ##ge , maid service all were great . . They will provide umbrella ##s for rain ##ing days like we had and then our flight was 4 hours after we checked and they allowed us to store our luggage until we left which was great [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was in an excellent location for restaurants , shopping and night ##life . The hotel front desk manager went above and beyond to make our stay excellent . I will definitely stay at this hotel again [SEP]
1	[CLS] John the door ##man was a big help , during my stay in Chicago . [UNK] . He was very polite and court ##eous , made me feel very welcomed . Wen ##t out of his way to help , I don ' t Know about rest of staff , but if they are anything like John . Would highly recommend to stay at She ##rato ##n hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Here for work . Friendly staff , lots of varieties pillows , super soft beds ( which really hurt my back - no support ) , and the rooms were nice but just nothing special at all . Every Fair ##mont I ' ve been to in the past has been really awesome but this one was just OK . Everything about it was great but the rooms were the OK part . I haven ' t been to Chicago before so it might be standard there ( like NY has small hotel rooms , etc ) . The lobby , bar , restaurant , con ##cier ##ge , front desk , location were all fantastic . I paid a good price so not at all disappointed but just thought the rooms were lack ##luster for a Fair ##mont . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This specific She ##rato ##n does not live up to their reputation . The hotel is worn down and needs some major T ##LC . There is nothing major wrong with the hotel , but the aesthetics could be way better . Although the location has amazing views it is a little out of the way of the transit system which can make it hard to get around when the weather isn ' t the greatest . I would stay here again if I found a great deal on hot ##wire or something , but would not pay full price for it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location for exploring Chicago could not be much better . Staff are great and the family room was great for us ( family of 5 ) . Didn ' t eat in the hotel as wanted to experience the local food - recommend Sunny Side Up just round the corner for a f ##ab breakfast [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of the Talbot ##t is outstanding . A short , 1 - 1 / 2 block walk to Michigan Avenue and the Water Tower area . Also , a quick walk to the subway , which we took to W ##rig ##ley Field for the Jimmy B ##uff ##ett concert . The front desk and street side staff our not only welcoming , but very at ##ten ##tive to your needs . It was a wonderful experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice stay as before . Very nice lobby , and great location on the river . Room was just fine , nice and clean . Z ##ak at check in was wonderful , and persona ##ble . We had a few drinks at the lobby bar where Juan was also amazing , and fun to talk to . I would be happy to stay here again . I don ' t think you can beat the location , it is close to Michigan avenue , Navy Pier , right on the river . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed 1 night for our anniversary . The Staff was amazing ( Especially Gwen at the front desk . She is a real treasure ! ) . They upgraded us to a suite . The room was large and very clean . The bed was very comfortable . The views were amazing . Location was perfect . Easy access to Navy Pier , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , River ##walk and great restaurants . We look forward to another stay ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel was pure luxury from service to food . It was top business place to be . We were given with a fantastic tips where to enjoy the city . Internet connection , rooms , food extremely ta ##sty , everything was perfect . We will be coming back in our next visit to the city [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this location previously when it was under renovation . This is my second stay . Love the proximity to Michigan Ave , River North restaurants and the el . My only knock is that my room was cleaned one single time during my 5 day stay . I ' d called the front desk to request " before noon " cleaning when I came back the first day after being out from 7 : 00 ##AM until almost 2 : 00 ##PM , and the room hadn ' t been cleaned . I don ' t think that made a difference . I ' m not messy , but I just like coming back to a straightened place . Other than that , I ' ll be back as I do this same trip every year . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Chicago is fortunate to have many world class hotels , and the Hilton is certainly on that list . A vintage structure beautifully maintained and updated for these times . En ##joy a cocktail in the lobby bar and people watch to your hearts content ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] the check - in clerk was able to determine exactly what taxi delivered me , so a forgotten item could be retrieved from the taxi within minutes . The room was comfortable , and spacious . The staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a weekend in the city . It ' s in a great location near the gold coast area . The rooms are nice and large and comfortable . We also had some app ##eti ##zers in the bar area which were quite good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cha ##rming hotel with polished service , delight de ##cor and nice on premise bar and dining . Excellent neighborhood for shopping Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile or just visiting Chicago . Same area as Four Seasons and W ##aldo ##rf but at much more reasonable price . Very clean , nicely updated with reasonable lay sized rooms especially for a city hotel . Excellent bath amenities and great water pressure with big flu ##ffy towels . Co ##m ##fy bed and quiet room . High ##ly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great view ! Great room ! Great v ##alet service ! Room service was very nice . The books in the room with information on Chicago was a nice addition to reference . Was b ##um ##med the rest ##ura ##nt was closed for renovations . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel did an excellent job se ##r ##vic ##ing our business trip post co ##vid in a city that has significantly changed . The bell ##men were wonderful , and friendly , especially Hussein . The front desk staff was super a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and the food we had everyday was very very good , which is not always expected . The service staff in our business area were friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting each day and every hour of our conference . We really appreciate the hard work and would recommend this hotel , definitely . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a nice place to stay and great location . Staff were very helpful . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions not as up to date as the Intercontinental in Buck ##head Atlanta but nice and clean . Would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you love grand , historical buildings and want a superb location for arts and culture in the Loop , I don ' t know how you could do better . To be sure , the rooms are a little on the old side but they have cool mirrors and other touches . Walking through the glorious lobby a couple times a day can take you back to the g ##lamour days of the 30 ' s and 40 ' s . Symphony is a block away , Millennium Park and the Art Institute are 2 blocks . I felt completely comfortable as an older , single woman . Wish the drinks in the lobby weren ' t so price ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a great time ! Was in town for business and we had excellent service from the hotel , as well as a very comfortable room with awesome amenities . Love ##d having a robe and slip ##pers - made me feel like i was at the spa after a relaxing shower and bath . 10 / 10 would recommend . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Everything and everyone was amazing . Room was great and very clean . I would most definitely stay again when I come to town . Shopping was also wonderful . I have never seen so many shops down a strip in my life . The restaurants were great . You have to try the deep dish pizza and the Chicago dog , it is an experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed 4 nights at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The staff were te ##rri ##fic . All very friendly and helpful . The location can ' t be beat , and is near everything with easy access to transit . Plus , Michael Jordan St ##eak ##house has the best steak ##s in town . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We love staying here for the location , quality of the rooms , staff and re ##p breakfast b ##uff ##et . The central location is great for shopping , fine restaurants within walking distance and sight seeing . We find the rooms are very clean , comfortable and show minimal wear . The staff from the front desk , v ##alet parking , restaurants are first rate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great room . Very Spa ##cious . Bath ##room was also very good and well equipped . The staff was very friendly and were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Great Location . We would strongly recommend this hotel and would be staying here if visiting Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] while this isn ' t a l ##ux hotel , the amenities include continental breakfast ( offered on each floor ) and an evening reception that includes drinks and app ##eti ##zers . Service is great , room is nice size , bathroom is large . Great deal for the price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We lived around the corner from this hotel until recently and absolutely love getting back to our neighborhood for periodic visits . We have stayed at the hotel 3 or 4 times in the last several months . B ##re at the front desk is sensation ##al - always remembers us and takes V ##ER ##Y good care of us . It is our " Chicago " home away from home ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] When my friend and I arrived at the Millennium we realised we hadn ' t booked a twin room . The lady at reception was very helpful and upgraded us to a suite ! The room was clean and had everything we needed . The view from the room wasn ' t the best but the location of the hotel more than made up for that , just off the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! Everything was within walking distance We stayed for 2 nights Would highly recommend this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel in a really nice location . Room with the right space , nice bathroom . Good internet service . Breakfast was really good quality . The provide anyway a compliment ##ary tea and co ##ffer every morning . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My U ##ber driver had problems trying to figure out how to get there due to the different levels of streets but finally made it . Hotel lobby is very nice . W ##IF ##I works very well . I got a standard room with two beds . Didn ' t see point in " upgrade " option they offered since I planned to see city and attend conference . Room was very nice and big . They allowed an hour late check ##out I needed . If you plan to park there , its insane . I saw a sign for something like $ 72 a day . So if you are driving , be aware of parking cost . Close to park and other things . Best dim sum restaurant I ' ve been to in a long time is very near by . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Lots of History here . It ' s in a great location overall . Been here before . I like it . . . I only get high floor rooms , so I don ' t really no what the other ones look like . Great full breakfast b ##uff ##et . . . . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great place to stay if you want to experience the Chicago Downtown area . You walking distance from Navy Pier , Ma ##g Mile , River walk and many more great site . The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly . It has a restaurant , bar , and coffee shop . [SEP]
1	[CLS] ST ##AN at the bell desk is AM ##A ##Z ##ING ! We were in town last week for a conference and I had to leave items for members of our staff to be delivered to their room and he was absolutely wonderful and helpful ! Didn ' t have to worry about a thing or check up on deliver ##ies , everything was handled perfectly . Also - he was just genuinely a pleasure to speak with that day , smile ##y and happy ! A gentleman ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a Chicago icon . It lives up to its badge . We were given a large room with a lounge ( upgraded at no cost on 4 July ) . The hotel has large halls and lo ##bb ##ies , despite its size lifts worked well and promptly . The rooms were very com ##fy . W ##if ##i had a good speed . The toilet ##tes were adequate . It was great to have a small kitchen . Location was perfect to explore Chicago , you could walk almost anywhere and if not a short U ##ber ride away would get you anywhere in no time . The check in was smooth , and the service was imp ##erson ##al but efficient . It was my 2nd stay in this property ( the first one had been 20 years ago ) and I can say the hotel retained its charm and lives up to expectations . I would highly recommend it . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I wanted to treat myself to a nice hotel and the So ##fit ##el met all my expectations . From the hotel staff to the exceptionally clean rooms , to the full - scale gym and excellent food , this hotel is worth the money . It ' s kind of price ##y , but considering the close proximity to shopping , great food and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , I expected to pay a little more . Again I was treating myself , so I did not mind . Everyone says " b ##on ##jou ##r " and is extremely polite and helpful . The " suite " that I got was a very small to be called a suite , however I ' ll still be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for the Chicago Tri ##ath ##lon event this weekend . Very rude front desk and would not accommodate our needs . Would not give us late check ##out and would not hold our bags for us even though we explained we were competing in t ##ria ##thal ##on . Park ##ing very expensive ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is historic which makes it beautiful but very over ##p ##rice ##d for what you get . The location was in very close proximity to the C ##IB ##C Theater where Hamilton is playing which is why we picked it . For that purpose it was perfect . However , the rooms were on the small side , very out ##dated , uncomfortable bed and no coffee machine or mini fridge ' s in the rooms . I wish we had stayed at the Hampton Inn right next door to the theater which is also a Hilton product . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a pretty standard Home ##wood Suite ##s hotel . Only two elevators for 13 floors ; the service elevator was out of service so getting an elevator was often very time consuming and crowded with staff and cart ##s . The evening food selection is OK but not great . Breakfast less so ; scrambled eggs were very over ##don ##e and often had cheese or other things mixed in . Be careful not to get assigned to a room without a real work desk or plug ##s anywhere near the narrow work table . Better choices in Chicago , like the Hilton Miracle Mile Suite ##s - a great hotel with far better rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very comfortable king size bed . TV was large with a lot of channels . You can pay extra to rent movies still in theaters . Great view . The river view is magnificent and even if you have a city view it ’ s very nice . Great location . Very clean which is important . They do charge extra for a microwave which I think is standard in most hotels but apparently not in a luxury hotel . I guess that ’ s really my only grip ##e so have to say I enjoyed my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very well located , fancy lobby and com ##fy room . The problem is the breakfast : the service was a mess , com ##ple ##t lack of management , over 20 minutes just to get your order . But even worse is the fact that w ##hem I booked the room the break ##fest was included , although NO ##BO ##D ##Y at the hotel was able to tell me what could I ordered without ad ##ition ##al charges . It ##´s not about the money but if something is included should be Crystal clear at the menu what to order in this case . Su ##mma ##riz ##ing , take your breakfast elsewhere and enjoy the hotel . By the way , the house ##keeping is very well done . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Good : Location The Bad : Must ##y smell in hallway ##s Room carpet ##ing soil ##ed El ##eva ##tors - all 3 out and waited 15 min on high floor not knowing ( appears to be a frequent problem ) . El ##eva ##tors out on 2 days . En ##tering room : G ##ar ##bage on floor ( M & Ms , papers ) Hotel is out ##dated and needs a complete overhaul . Would not recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is great , a short walk to millennium park and the Art Institute of Chicago . Food , bar and amenities were excellent . Well set up for business conferences . Love ##ly rooms . Help ##ful staff at all times . [SEP]
0	[CLS] H ##ya ##tt Regency have best location , kindly service and wonderful view . . I recommend this hotel if you visit Chicago . However I wish I could swim if it has a pool . Except that , overall it is good hotel with family . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bath ##rooms super tiny and sub ##par for this type of hotel , tub floor was b ##ou ##ncy , windows were dirty , refrigerator had a bad odor . Pool was super deep and nowhere for kids to play , mild ##ew on tile . On a positive note , staff was friendly and great , location is perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t was beautiful and clean . There was a little s ##na ##ff ##oo with payment , as I was travelling for work and my personal card I put down for incident ##als somehow ended up being charged for the 3 rooms I booked and incident ##al charges I never had , but Chris the manager handled it well and made it right . I happened to be in my room when house ##keeping stopped by and Se ##mara , the housekeeper on the 10 - 11th floor ( who just happened to be on the 12th floor for the day ) , was an absolute pleasure . Such a great attitude , and very thorough . House ##keeping doesn ' t get thanked enough for what they do , and they work so hard . Thank you ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My 3 requirements for any hotel : - super clean - check ! - good bed & bed ##ding - check ! - good water pressure in the shower - fail I was attending a 2 - day conference in the hotel . My room was on the 9th floor . The property feels slightly tired - p ##eel ##ing wall ##paper in the bathroom , chip ##ped base ##board paint , etc . - not up to the typical Fair ##mont standard . But otherwise everything was good except for the low water pressure in the shower . I have very short hair so it was not a problem , but if you have long / thick hair this could really bug you . ( You might op ##t to wash your hair in the tub instead . ) Line ##ns were thick and flu ##ffy and personal care items were really nice . The location is great . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Home ##wood suites offer a home ##ly feeling as the suites are like a small apartment with a kitchen and living room . My suite was clean and perfect for my need of staying almost two weeks for a business trip . Location of this hotel very close to many restaurants and CT ##A Red line station was ideal for my needs . Staff at this hotel were very friendly and provided an excellent service I would normally expect from any Hilton Brand hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great Location for first time city visitors . No evidence of bugs only dust b ##un ##nies . . . and I looked everywhere ! House ##keeping needs a little improvement cleaning between guests as I had to clean things missed in the bathroom myself . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was wonderful , front desk service not ideal , way over ##pa ##id compared to other guests and the room was small and dark . Another family member had issues with his key every time . Overall the stay was okay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Travel ##iers . . . . . . like most O ##mini Hotels . . . . . . this one is awesome ! Room is big and beautiful ! The overall is outstanding ! The Bed is really good and pillows are too . The W ##i - Fi speed is great . The staff is first rate ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at The Talbot ##t the weekend of St . Patrick ' s Day . All staff members were very helpful and pleasant , including the front desk , the con ##cier ##ge , and the guys at the door - particularly D ##wayne . We were upgraded to a King Room and enjoyed the extra space of the room . It was quiet in our section of the 6th floor , so that was nice as well . En ##joy ##ed a meal and drinks at the co ##zy restaurant at The Talbot ##t ( also had great meals at Lu ##x ##bar and B ##ist ##ron ##omi ##c ) . We definitely plan on staying at The Talbot ##t again ! Many thanks to the staff for having such a customer - oriented focus ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great hotel good amenities . Would go back there again , the walls are a shade thin for how luxurious the hotel is however not the biggest issue on my end , I wasn ' t traveling with children and was up before everyone else any ##how . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This property has a very modern and ups ##cale feel while delivering wonderful customer service from the moment you walk into the lobby . This is a great location as it is surrounded completely by restaurants and bars ! Wonderful overall stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This will be a very brief review , I picked this hotel because we would be party ##ing at the Drake Hotel ( which is next door ) for NY ##E and wanted to be somewhere close and affordable so in that regard K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker fit the bill perfectly . The room was fine and the bed was com ##fy . The main reason for this review is W ##IF ##I , which Hotel in this century still charges for w ##if ##i access , if hotels in third world countries and 1 star hotels can provide free w ##if ##i why a Hotel of this caliber is charging ? Path ##etic much ! ! That was truly a turn off , because I wasn ' t about to sit in the lobby just to have free w ##if ##i . The hotel seemed very nice but I would never stay there again if in Chicago because we need w ##if ##i for work and access to people . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had an interesting view of an art etc ##hing on the side of the building which was very cool . The food at the conference was great . The funk ##y de ##cor was a lot of fun and different all over the hotel . It was a nice stay . Service was great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Mrs . Coffee and I had a splendid overnight celebrating my birthday . The staff is exceeding ##ly warm and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble , and attended to our particular needs with anticipation and courtesy . In particular , Travis Howard ensured our visit was fl ##aw ##less from beginning to end . In s ##tri ##ving to distinguish themselves from other facilities of this caliber , they have made an in ##del ##ible impression on us and we look forward to returning . Until then , we know we can always p ##la ##cate ourselves with a cocktail in the bar of Booth One , where the friendly , knowledge ##able , and , in one case , familiar bartender ##s are quite pleasant and eager to serve . We recommend to anyone in the area during the traditional hours of l ##iba ##tion to visit them for re ##f ##resh ##ment . Ch ##eers ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ’ ve been coming here for years — love the suite format . The restaurant is always good , the wait staff consistent and reliable . The front desk staff were genuinely friendly as well as the bell ##man . The room was made up at the time we requested . Quiet place on Michigan Avenue . Great location at a good price point . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hotel Monaco is absolutely lovely ! ! ! The rooms are beautiful and comfortable ! We had a river view room with 2 window seats - fantastic ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The lobby is beautiful as well , and the staff was very friendly ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s always a wonderful experience to stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago , perfectly located and beautifully managed . The Café des Architect ##es est is one of the best restaurant in town , and the new bar is so attractive . The whole team ( con ##cier ##ge , restaurant , reception ) are always very at ##ten ##tive and the comfort in the room is very much appreciated [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful ##ly decorated hotel in the heart of the loop in ch ##ica ##go . We travelled with our one year old and they were extremely a ##cco ##mo ##dating . Location wise was spot on and also had a comfortable room . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This place was ok , Dec ##ent location to the downtown area . OK rooms . Nothing special . De ##fia ##ntly an older property . The business center wasn ' t working . Don ' t plan to have dinner at the hotel . Nice little bar for drinks . Piano music . Nice little coffee place in the morning with a decent breakfast . Would stay again . The staff was pretty helpful . Con ##cier ##ge was very know ##led ##gable and helpful . the shower was hard to work and you had hot and cold spray ##ing at you . The beds were very comfortable and so were the pillows . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything was perfect , nice staff , great view , great location , TV had Netflix . Great restaurants we ’ re in walking distance , close walk to a great mall , navy pier was close as well . Really peaceful stay and me and the wife definitely will be back soon [SEP]
1	[CLS] I choose the Swiss ##ote ##l because of a recommendation of a cow ##or ##ker . From the moment we arrived the staff was very inviting and the manager Matt was able to offer us dome suggestions on some things we could do around the city ( Thank you Matt ) . Our room had the most amazing views so when we were not out and about in the city , we were able to enjoy the city from our room . The big plus for me was that my wife was beyond impressed with both our room and the hotel . We will definitely be back . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am still here with my family . I travel a lot for work and generally like Hilton properties but this one is nothing special . N ##eg ##ative : - Too ##k a long time to check in - If you get upper floor there is only one elevator that is working and it takes forever to get on - Not very clean - can not control te ##mp in room . It is lower 70 ’ s , I like 68 or lower in winter . They were rude when we called to ask about getting it changed so we left it . - restaurant is awful , too expensive really bad service . Good : - we traveled with my parents and they put us in rooms kind of close . - pool is big and has hot tub - fitness ##es center is nice / big [SEP]
1	[CLS] A grand hotel property with wonderful architecture & great history ! The room de ##cor does not match the historical building , but they are clean & well appointed . The service was great , with moments of the “ excellent ” you expect as a Hilton Honors Gold Member . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s were a little small but okay . Lo ##bby and cafe was very nice . The bar was taste ##fully decorated - very nice staff . We had to ask to get our room made up as they missed it one day . Cut ##e street , close to all the nice areas ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed at O ##m ##ni Hotel for two nights , the view from the 25th floor was acceptable - as the area is full of other taller buildings , but the rooms were so ##oo nice . I liked how diverse their front desk was , we checked in with a beautiful Ghana ##ian young lady , and another gorgeous lady with Russian accent helped me cancel my price ##line deal reservation ( non ##re ##fu ##nda ##ble ) . The hotel is in the heart of the Ma ##g Mile , we walked to many attraction sites , such as the John Hancock building and Chicago ' s Water Tower . Overall , we enjoyed our stay at O ##m ##ni Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 4 days stay with a colleague for business . The only great thing about this hotel is the location at Michigan Avenue ( Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ) . The hotel appears old and dated to me , even tough I had what looked as a recently refurbished suite . No recognition as S ##pire Ambassador , but 250 ##points " welcome bonus " . Everything is " over ##p ##rice ##d " , as if this was a luxury hot ##e . It is definitely not . I got an acceptable rate , and would have been very di ##ssa ##point ##ed if I had paid the a higher rate . Vale ##t parking at 75 ##US ##D / night is a complete robbery . Would not stay here again , as there are plenty better alternatives around in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel placed in the middle of Chicago has its in ##con ##ven ##ience ##s . Direct ##ly placed next to over ##ground trains you see and hear them - all time . Walking me up every night at 4 am , no need for a wake up call . Paper thin walls ( I can hear my neighbor ’ s conversations do not add to the comfort . I think this Is also the smallest hotel room I have ever been in in the US . The closet is not even wide even to hang your shirts . It is clean an proper looking but there are things you cannot make up for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Location wise , this hotel could not be any better . I had a lovely and comfortable room , and would book here again if I returned to Chicago ! Re ##ception staff were friendly and knowledge ##able and gave tips on where to go etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Late review . I stayed here for my annual visit to Chicago from 15 August - 20 August . Love , love , love this hotel . Service gets better every ##time , staff are awesome from Will who greet ##s you when you arrive , to the guys who bring your luggage to your room . Check in is super quick and I was given a larger room . I cannot fault this hotel at all . It is my hotel when staying in Chicago . The staff really do go above and beyond . F ##abulous location and the beds are so ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##oo ##o comfortable . This hotel gives understands customer service - f ##abulous Thank you all at the Intercontinental and see you next year : - ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first trip to Chicago . This hotel was in an excellent location . Easy ride from the airport and very accessible because of the location and proximity to trains . I am not a hotel person but this hotel had style . Lo ##bby is beautiful and the bar was a place that I felt comfortable in . Staff helpful , room was small but very clean and comfortable . We had everything that we needed . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a busy property located within a 15 - 20 minute walk to the museum campus ( She ##dd A ##qua ##rium , Field Museum , and Adler Planet ##arium ) and a short walk to Millennium Park . The rooms were well appointed . Our party of 7 stayed in 2 different 2 Queen Bed , 2 bathroom room . This type of room is a major advantage of this hotel . The Diamond member benefit was a $ 20 v ##ou ##cher per night per room for breakfast at the coffee shop . I was under the impression it was a credit at this restaurant , but there are apparently restrictions on how the credit can be used . No upgrade was offered for the room and we were put on a normal floor . A bit of a disappointment for the Diamond status . Overall , it was a comfortable stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our room was spacious and lovely . Staff everywhere was first rate - shout ##out to D ##wayne out front , lovely man who was friendly , helpful and fun - also great restaurant / bar where we loved starting our day with excellent breakfast and ending with night ##cap out front . Can ’ t imagine staying anywhere else the next time we ’ re in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was recently at this hotel as a business travel ##er . My company has it as a preferred hotel however we have other preferred hotels I will be staying at after this experience . I was moved from the 33rd floor to the 31st floor after encounter ##ing ta ##ttered furniture , and p ##eel ##ing head ##boards where someone ' s g ##rea ##sy head has damaged the head ##board . The situation only got worse . The room on the 31st floor was smaller and had the SA ##ME damage to the furniture . I sent a note to the front desk manager upon returning home from my travels and he has chosen not to respond or acknowledge me . Bad . Won ' t be staying here again . It ' s really unfortunate this happened and ta ##rn ##ishes the Fair ##mont brand for sure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is in a prime location . The employees were all great , and a ##cco ##mo ##dating . Room needed some co ##sm ##etic upgrades . . The bathroom f ##au ##ce ##t had worn away the bottom frame of the bathroom mirror , carpet was f ##ray ##ed at the threshold ##s , etc . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed the the hotel one time before this visit . We like the location for shopping and dining and walk ##ability to Chicago events , stores , and restaurants . The de ##cor is nice . Co ##m ##fort ##able lobby . Nice to have a restaurant and bar . Friendly Staff goes above and beyond to be welcoming . Safe location . We will want to visit again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] First of all this is the first review I ’ ve ever written in my whole life but I had to take the time and go online just to write this because I was so impressed with the hospitality and kindness that was given to us by John the bartender s ##t this restaurant . His personality is amazing he is the most kind ##est ha ##pp ##iest and helpful employee that was at this hotel and restaurant . He gave us many suggestions where to go for a day in Chicago . So happy that we picked this hotel I would highly recommend it I would highly recommend the Columbus tap ##room to anybody visiting Chicago . It ’ s so pleasant and the food was delicious . I really appreciate John ward I would definitely return to this place [SEP]
1	[CLS] We went to Chicago for the first time and booked in to this hotel , have to say a lovely place to stay . Central to everything . Staff were very helpful and the food in the restaurant was outstanding . I Would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone [SEP]
0	[CLS] I love this place . The location is perfect and provides access ##ibility to all the best that is Chicago . It is safe , clean , and really contemporary - class ##y . The bed was so ##oo comfortable ! Have a talk with the employees , they ' re locals and really nice . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic visit ! I loved the outdoor cafe and how it looks from the street . The Talbot ##t feels like an old hotel of quality service in its ups ##cale de ##cor and friendly am ##bian ##ce Location is amazing ##ly bra ##vo [SEP]
1	[CLS] Last year I spent a lot of time in the Gold Coast . I fell in love with the area so much that when I moved to NY I picked the U ##WS as it felt the most like the G ##C . Any ##time we come to Chicago we stay at the Ambassador ! The team always goes above and beyond to make sure we pick up where we left off ! Our whole family got to experience the hotel and all its personal touches thanks to Travis , Rachel and Je ##red ! Thank you everyone ! It was only one night but you all made it pretty memorable for our celebration ! See you when it warm ##s up - br ##rr ##r [SEP]
1	[CLS] V ##isi ##ted on a business trip and liked the convenient location in downtown Chicago that allowed for walking to my work location and Chicago attractions . Also like to maintain my fitness routine when I travel , and loved the full scale gym on the property . Also enjoyed getting discount on breakfast in the din ##ning room with H ##H Gold and Diamond access . Also has a Star ##bu ##cks located on ##site . Not sure if I would stay for personal travel , but would recommend for Business if you want a convenient / all access morning routine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed at this hotel and found the stay very good . We had excellent service from reception , dining room , con ##cier ##ge everyone we had contact with . Our room was very pleasant nice view over the city , good bathroom facilities with bath and walk in shower and really nice toilet ##ries provided . The room was well maintained , very clean with all amenities including free w ##if ##i . The hotel is in a great location a short walk from the magnificent mile and all the sights across the road from the hotel is a lovely park with the added bonus of a coffee house serving great coffee . Would recommend So ##fit ##el [SEP]
1	[CLS] amazing stay with lovely staff in reception , h ##k are super nice and the food is amazing w ##oo ##oo ##oo ##w , ill re ##come ##nd this hotel to my people . thank you all the staff for making me happy during my whole stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would not stay here for pleasure , there is none . A ##ppe ##ars to be a business hotel , no atmosphere . There is nothing special , I would imagine not been updated in years . Po ##sitive is location is good , room was quite nice though some maintenance issues . Would not stay here again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pick ##ed the O ##m ##ni because of its location and the fact that the rooms are suites . As expected , the hotel is well located on Michigan Ave . with easy access to stores and restaurants . It was nice to have a suite although it ' s not a big suite . There was also a wet bar . The staff was pleasant and the room was clean would definitely stay here again . Ask for a city view . [SEP]
0	[CLS] As I ' ve always found Fair ##mont gold exceeds in every way with personal touches including staff who remember guests from last year ' s visit . It ' s my home in Chicago for business or pleasure . I ' ll be back next year if not sooner . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was nice enjoyed the room . The kids just wanted some Extra blankets without any has ##tle . They said the delivery person was rude . The location was necessary for the occasion . We had a family wedding . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel in early November to visit my brother . The hotel itself is lovely but the staff where very rude . Not very helpful . If you want to stay at a hotel that looks great but treats you badly this is the place for you . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel in a great location . The staff was excellent . We had a minor issue with the room and the staff members went out of their way to make it right . The parking v ##alet remembered us from the first encounter and gave us great service through ##t the entire weekend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my second time staying at the Hotel on business . The workers are also very friendly and helpful . My room was clean and the food / drinks at the restaurant were great . I will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly hotel . King Superior room was spacious . Show ##er head a little on the weak side . Located walking distance from the John Hancock Observatory and within all the high - end stores . No room service , but there ' s a bar located within that also serves some delicious food you can take to your room . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We went on a tour of the hotel during Open House Chicago . We were very surprised how run down the public spaces in the hotel looked . Peel ##ing paint in the ballroom ##s , very run down and torn furniture . You could see the past glory in some of the spaces - but you really had to use your imagination . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is set where the iconic " P ##ump Room " - which was the meeting place of infamous Second City comics , actors and Chicago ##an g ##lite ##rat ##i . The P ##ump Room still exists and has come into its own again , as a top restaurant in Chicago . The hotel has undergone an extensive and impressive renovation . Up ##grade to a suite , for ultimate g ##lamour , it ' s well worth the extra price . The rooftop restaurant has amazing views of Chicago . Alto ##get ##her , the elements of this hotel make for a great romantic get ##away , business meeting place or location for a special event - like a wedding - but still bout ##ique and personal enough that you won ' t get lost in the s ##hu ##ffle . [SEP]
0	[CLS] So I had made a last minute request to the hotel staff about putting rose petals and a bottle of champagne in our room because it was my girlfriend ##s and I anniversary . To my surprise - having it be ready by the time I had checked in was amazing ! What was more amazing was that the staff was nothing but friendly , respect ##ful and so thoughtful ! Being in a same - sex relationship and getting recognition not only from the check in staff but staff from the restaurant was amazing ! There was nothing but love from the staff when all I ' m used to is getting dirty looks from people ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a beautiful , clean , and safe property with super helpful and friendly staff . i loved how they had tight CO ##VI ##D pre ##ca ##ution ##s . i never felt un ##safe here . It was also in a very convenient location . I will return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Hotel All ##egro while in town celebrating our sons 2nd birthday . Upon arrival the front desk agent Leah was very helpful , giving us the run down on the area and the hotel . Once she found out it was our sons birthday she made his evening by sending cake to our room and a tray of treats . We really appreciate her friend ##liness and through ##ly enjoyed our stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Recently stayed here with a family of 5 . The staff was great , rooms were large and the location can ' t be beat . Just a few feet away from the Red line with access to W ##rig ##ley and Museum Campus . Even when returning late at night we felt safe . Quick walk to Navy Pier and everything on Michigan Ave . Breakfast was fine ( typical for most Hilton properties ) . Room ##s start on the 7th floor so most have at least some view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Its a good location in the middle of town . Check in br ##isk and easy . Everything looks and feels a little on the 80 - 90s side when it comes to de ##cor in rooms and corridors and elevators . The room is big enough , all the touches are older style . Its got a room ##y bathroom but its old and needs an update . Room service was solid . Service is great . Everyone I encountered friendly and helpful . If you want a hip experience this isn ' t it . There has to be a cool hip hotel that competes with the Fair ##mont ' s . Its massive . There was a conference in play at the time , made for a crowded time at the bar . So , all ok , solid but un ##spect ##ac ##ular . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was in a good location for most things we wanted to do . 15 minutes walk to the center of downtown . Room service was not good in the fact we had a dirty cup outside our room in the corridor for 5 days . When mentioned it to house keeping they said it wasn ’ t her job . We picked it up and put it on her trolley . Mini bar very expensive . £ ##5 . 23 for one can of co ##ke . Bath was partly blocked and I had to wait for water to disappear before I could r ##ins ##e my feet properly . Staff were all friendly but one in particular . Rene in the club house was brilliant . Nothing was too much trouble . He made a point of speaking to everyone in the lounge . He is a credit to the She ##rato ##n and hope they realise that . It ’ s the people that make the experience , he achieved that on his own . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here wanting to book a Hilton property close to the C ##IB ##C Theater . It was perfect ! Within walking distance . Love ##d the am ##bian ##ce , the historical architecture and our room was quiet . We would definitely stay here again . Potter ’ s ( located in the lobby near the elevators ) for a b ##urger ( Palmer Square ) and an Old Chicago Maple Manhattan was enjoyable as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was here for 3 days for a conference and really enjoyed my stay at The Fair ##mont . The rooms are spacious and very comfortable . I loved the fact that you could crack the window in the room and get fresh air . What stood out the most was the level of service . As a season ##ed travel ##er I appreciate the warm welcome and friendly staff . They have a top notch con ##cier ##ge team and I must say a special thank you to Alex . He provided my group with an excellent choice for dinner , Ocean Prime . He took the time out to discuss several options and was wonderful . We were pleasant ##ly surprised when we were told at the end of our dinner that the con ##cier ##ge team took care of our dessert . That is service at its best ! I ’ m looking forward to a future visit this summer . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fun weekend stay right before Christmas - Love ##ly luxurious weekend . Right off Michigan at Erie . Great staff , everyone from con ##cier ##ge to Bell ##men / woman . Room was beautiful and clean . Got a great deal too ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is in the perfect location - right off Michigan Avenue . F ##abulous restaurants and shopping as well as Northwestern Hospital are short walking distances . All of the rooms are suites which is a wonderful luxury in Chicago . I will absolutely still here again on my next trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] De ##fin ##ite ##ly recommend this hotel . Room ##s were super clean and newly re ##mo ##del ##ed . Bed was super comfortable . Breakfast was good but could benefit by offering more fruit options . Best part of this hotel however was the location . Will definitely come again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location for our family . America Girl is just a short walk away and the Disney store is across the street .

1	[CLS] We stayed here one night with family . Room ##s are clean and updated , though I was surprised there weren ' t more USB ports for charging . Great city and river views from our room . U ##ber pick up is easy . We had a problem at check in - I asked about club lounge access and was told our Bon ##voy status wasn ' t eligible at this hotel . After we reviewed our reservation that clearly listed lounge access , we returned downstairs and were told a mistake was made and we got the situation corrected . Breakfast area in club lounge was way too small , as it is in most hotels , so get there early . All employees were friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] E ##ff ##icient and friendly reception ; clean everywhere including all common areas and my room . I was on the 18th floor ; room was ready early , at least 2 hours early , so I was able to dump baggage , re ##f ##resh and head out again well before dinner hour .

1	[CLS] I booked this room as a last minute trip and had family staying near by . It is central ##ly located , within walking distance to all the shopping , many restaurants and Navy Pier . Best deal in that general vicinity . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stacy and Marvin helped us keep our 3 G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s pizza ' s frozen we had promised to bring home for our family . They were so helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to us . We will be sure to stay here on our next visit to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It was our second time at this hotel . We stayed one night . Love ##d the de ##cor and the social hour ( they had rose for Valentine ’ s weekend and hot c ##ider ) , the lobby has co ##zy places to sit and chat with friends . We arrived in the morning , but they had a room available and checked us in right away , which was really nice . The room was comfortable . We would definitely stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] O ##m ##ni Chicago has great service and safe hotel , the food was good room service was time ##ly . Great Location was to shopping . The rooms were al ##ittle tired ##all rooms are suites and large , and bathroom wasn ’ t that clean . Overall a great stay but for the price would probably look at another selection of hotels . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good service from all hotel staff . Nice room at reasonable price . Con ##ven ##ient pool for kids since the it 3 foot deep everywhere . However , bathroom issues required 2 calls to front desk which has been annoying . [SEP]

0	[CLS] Do NO ##T stay at this hotel if you have a big group . The staff does not know how to efficiently host large groups . They had terrible attitudes when our group had to check in our bags . They gave us tons of tickets for our bags and then failed to return all of our bags to us in a time ##ly and efficient manner . They eventually had us go into the room to find and grab our bags because their system was horrible . In addition , checking into our rooms was a long and painful process that I ’ ve never had to experience at any hotel where I was apart of a large group . Overall , the staff was under prepared for large groups and has a terrible attitude when they have to accommodate . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visited this hotel in the beg ##gin ##ing of may 2019 as a base for our bus ##sin ##es trip and was satisfied with service it offers . It is close to everything You want to visit in Chicago - Willis Tower , Navy pier , Mill ##eni ##um park , Ma ##gni ##ficient Mile and much more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed three nights . If you swim , bring your bathing suit . The pool is awesome . My wife swam laps in the junior Olympic size architectural g ##em of a pool . The room was nice , not large . Staff members were very pleasant and helpful answering questions and giving directions . Very convenient downtown location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you book in the hotel page , you will find good rates and promotions . It is highly recommended to sub ##s ##cribe to their loyalty program , because you get some per ##ks . From O ' Hare airport one just have to take the train blue line and it is one block walking from there . One can also walk to the Willis Tower , the Silver Bean ( Cloud Gate ) and many other sights ##ee ##ing . If you couldn ' t make it to the evening social wine hour , the bar of the hotel is an excellent place to go . Don ' t forget to ask for Ra ##fa and Omar ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We chose this hotel because of its location next door to Buddy Guy ' s Legends . And we like the Hilton hotels because of consistency . Beautiful hotel lobby and absolutely fantastic staff . Going back next January . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice modern and clean hotel with sleek design . Room ##s are a nice size with cool modern bathroom ##s and clean efficient gym . The check in staff were not much help . Kind of rude actually and I ' m from Chicago so it ' s not that . They did not bother to tell us about the evening wine reception . We were surprised to see a lobby full of 20 something ' s enjoying drinks and app ##eti ##zers when we returned to the hotel around 6 . Were these people guests of the hotel ? Love the welcoming pet policy and while kids are welcome , the hotel doesn ' t do much to be welcoming . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel is beautiful , room was spot ##less , check in / check out process sea ##m ##less . Everyone was professional and friendly . The hotel has a great location which is very convenient . Bed ##s are com ##fy . The food was delicious . [SEP]

Have been to this hotel multiple times and will continue to use it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I must say I was expecting just a bit more of an ups ##cale experience than we received during our stay but the accommodation ##s were acceptable and comfortable . The hotel service was friendly and helpful . We checked our luggage upon arrival as we were early to the room . Once checked in , the luggage was brought to our room which was convenient but time consuming . it took about 30 min ##s to receive our luggage . We also requested a Do Not Di ##st ##ur ##b sign , twice , which we never received . The beds were comfortable and the room generally clean . We had to request a refrigerator and there was no coffee maker in the room . Location is great . Up ##sca ##le shopping on the street level of the hotel and includes a Star ##bu ##cks . Within easy walking distance of Millennium Park , Restaurant ##s , Art Museum . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Great location , charming surroundings . I stayed for three days and I missed a comfortable chair in the room . I also missed having coffee in the room . They offer compliment ##ary coffee in the lobby in the morning but I needed to get dressed prior to having coffee which was out of order . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you find yourself needing to travel to Chicago , and want a bout ##ique hotel that is con ##ven ##ei ##ent , contemporary , and where they know your name , and care , consider the Monaco . The rates are steep , but the rooms are spacious and recently red ##one . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Location , Location , Location ! ! ! ! Location is what sold me on booking our weekend here , but the hotel and service is what will bring back there .

The hotel was in fantastic shape and the service was the same . At ##e breakfast at 67 ##6 both mornings and it was great . Op ##ted for dinner at Fleming ' s which was within walking distance on Ohio Street . Could have gone to a ton of other restaurants as well . So many to pick from in the area . Every staff member from v ##alet parking to the person offering turn down service to bar and restaurant staff were a delight . Can ' t wait to get back here . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here because it was close to all the activities we wanted to do , it also had a pool , kick ##back and breakfast . For all this hotel has to offer , it was worth the price . Our room did smell must ##y and the pillows were terrible ( I am pick ##y about this though . ) The front desk guy Michael was my favorite part of this hotel ! He made my mornings and started me off on the right foot ! I would stay at this hotel again but feel its close to needing a few upgrades . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in a perfect location . We attended the Chicago Go ##ur ##met event and this hotel was extremely convenient . It is close to Michigan Ave as well as Millennium Park ( where the festival was held ) . The Big Bar at the hotel was a perfect start off point to our weekend .

The rooms were nicely appointed and our end of the hall location was very quiet . [SEP]

Great place to stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was great , very clean . Bed ##s were com ##fy , wasn ##t a big fan of the too soft pillows .

1	[CLS] My wife and I visited for an overnight get a way from the suburbs . This luxury hotel is in a perfect location for our adventures .

Wonderful service , A large room with a view of Lake Michigan and the top of Q ##ui ##gley Seminary can be had by up ##grading to at least the 25th Floor on the East side of the hotel . It is much less expensive to avoid the Vale ##t at the hotel and book an overnight at two next door parking garage ##s . $ 43 vs . $ 75 . St ##roll ##ing Ch ##est ##nut , Delaware and Rush in the am was a great reminder of when we both lived in the area years ago . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]

As a Diamond member the compliment ##ary premium internet and $ 30 per day food / beverage credit was a nice bonus . Con ##cier ##ge staff was extremely helpful . They suggested the show Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that was opening the weekend we were there . It was an amazing show and one of the highlights of our trip . Strong ##ly recommend , if you have time to see it . Overall a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] First , if you don ' t get a king room , the double room has twin beds which won ' t comfortably sleep 2 people . Upon check in I was told there was no available room , unless I paid for an upgrade . I asked for a gym or other place where I could change , and they said I would have to go to a health club [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came for the location and were rewarded with an extra ##ord ##ina ##rily clean and com ##fy environment and excellent service ! ! We had lots of room choices . We chose floor 18 and our room faced the Jean ##nie Gang high rise ( currently being constructed . ) Great location and wonderful welcoming staff . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I ' ve been staying at Conrad Hotels since the Conrad in Indy first opened , about 10 years ago or so . This was my first stay in Conrad Chicago . While it has its own style , the bottom line remains the same . The staff is fantastic . Everyone is friendly , knows their stuff , and will go the extra mile to help if you need it . The room is clean , it ' s comfortable , and borders on luxurious . I always sleep well in a Conrad . I don ' t know what they do , and I don ' t want to j ##ynx myself , but I have never had a bad night ' s sleep in a Conrad . For that reason alone I would recommend it , but when you factor in all the other positive ##s they blown the competition away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 4 days during a business conference . Great location right on the river , right in the heart of the CB ##D and close to shopping and great restaurants .

The hotel staff was E ##XT ##RE ##ML ##E ##Y D ##IS ##CR ##EE ##T . Would stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed a couple times and the rooms are nice , have a couch and sitting area . Pool is very warm and w ##hir ##l ##pool is also nice . Great breakfast with the b ##uff ##et v ##ou ##chers , lots of options and they all taste great . It ' s nice they have v ##alet but keep in mind it could take up to 40 min to get your car during peak times , such as at check ##out time and at 5 ##pm . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ce ##le ##bra ##ting the Fourth of July here , BA ##D ID ##EA ! No view of the fireworks ! No pool ! No access to apps like Netflix and Hu ##lu on the TV ! The $ 20 movie purchase of John W ##ick 3 expired way before it said it was supposed to . We do have a nice view of Navy Pier ( again , no fireworks though ) but the windows are dirty and spiders and their dinner are all over them , luck ##ily on the outside . Look at the picture , the view is de ##ceiving ! Zoo ##m in to see the spiders . Enough said ! I ’ m so disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about the hotel is superb including location and friend ##liness of staff ; the room size , food and amenities are excellent .

0	[CLS] Everyone has to have a place to go to when you travel to different cities . We frequent Chicago and was looking for a new hotel to stay . We found it here at So ##fit ##el . We were made to feel at home , important and valuable . Who doesn ’ t want to feel that way ? [SEP]
1	[CLS] The room was gorgeous . A bit of in ##con ##sist ##ency upon check in . We were told one thing , our friends told something completely different and we came on the same Travel ##zo ##o promotion . Service in the breakfast area bordered on ridiculous . Food was ta ##sty but overly priced . I would come back again however . [SEP]

1	[CLS] Ambassador East needed an upgrade and they certainly got it with Public ! Love the v ##ibe of the re ##va ##mp ##ed P ##ump Room and nothing beats the Library Bar !

1	[CLS] We got a cheap rate for this hotel on Hot ##wire . com , but know this would be an expensive stay otherwise . I ' ve stayed at another Kim ##pton hotel recently and liked that one much better . The staff here was friendly . This hotel is in a great location . It is close to restaurants , shopping , and the theater . The water in the shower acted like it was going to shut off at any point , which shouldn ' t be a worry at a 4 . 5 star hotel . It ' s a fine hotel . It was clean and well kept . I don ' t know , I just expected to be impressed for a 4 . 5 star hotel . And I wasn ' t . There is nothing wrong with it , and I would stay here again , but just wasn ' t w ##owed and impressed . [SEP]

1	[CLS] I highly recommend the O ##m ##ni . All suites , great location , at ##ten ##tive staff , del ##uxe room at a reasonable price . Lo ##yal ##ty ambassador Kris ##top ##her Campbell made our stay extra special - including a birthday treat for my spouse ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at Hilton Chicago while on a business trip . It ' s central ##ly located with the nice walking area and busy streets with lots of restaurants outside . Room ##s were nicely appointed . I was happy with the service provided . It has nice re ##tro style elevators and old historic photographs in the lobby which reminds of the grand old days . I enjoyed my stay at this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our team stayed here , and while we maybe felt a bit under - dressed , it was a great location to get to everything . The tour ##ney was at Navy Pier , the girls found Target and were able to easily jump on a boat tour and walk the blocks to Mill ##eni ##um Park to take pictures with the bean ! The rooms are great - the beds , pillows and shower were fantastic . We were able to get free w ##if ##i with our SP ##G membership . It was a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Plus : super location , 2 short blocks from red line metro , easy access to ma ##g mile and downtown . Corner suite with second window wall really opened up the room . They will hold bags for your last day . Pleasant staff . Late check out no problem . Kitchen . Co ##m ##fort ##able bed . Min ##us : there are no extra ##s at this time - not even the breakfast sandwich you got in early co ##vid - nothing . Kitchen has neither d / w soap nor even paper towels ( ! ) You get plates and glasses . But at least a f / s fridge ( with one ( ! ) ice tray ) . No house ##keeping . Yes , there will be disrupt ##ive people in the street lobby who don ' t belong there . Ho ##rri ##bly uncomfortable sofa . Place is mainly a value for convenient location - plan on using super easy CT ##A , parking is like $ 60 a night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is my second stay here and it ' s just an all around very nice place . Room ##s are nice , beds are comfortable , they give you everything you need , location is good , I would stay again . Located right next door to all the nice shopping for when your not working or need something . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon arrival Nelson Mass ##ini greeted us at the registration desk . We were first time travelers to Chicago . It was a holiday weekend and was a very busy place with lots of people . We had lots of questions about check in and parking . Nelson took the time to answer all our questions with a caring and relaxed attitude . Being new to the city we felt Nelson went above and beyond with his excellent customer service . This man deserves a raise ! ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my first time at this particular Kim ##pton hotel , and is now one of my favorites ! Dec ##ent room rates , great location , friendly staff , beautiful lobby and nicely renovated rooms . Will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always stay at The Talbot ##t when we come to town for a Cubs game . We have stayed here twice this year already and plan on staying again come August for another Cubs game . We are always treated great and enjoy ourselves . D ##wayne N ##ef ##f is definitely one of our favorites at the property and Charles is always a pleasure to see when we first get to town . Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great location and place to stay for a great time why your staying in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful lobby - a true classic . There probably the compliment ##s end as the rooms would seem to be some of the most dates , last renovated in the last century , if not the 19th ! Overall rooms looking very tired and the bathroom ##s ancient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 3 nights . Great allocation but rooms need major up ##grading . Show ##er had poor drainage , iron cord broken and TV had a black line down the screen . Room service services room after 1 : 00 ##pm . Be careful what you leave out on counters as they have a habit of just throwing it away . Probably won ’ t stay an I ##H ##G hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From the beginning of check ##in through the exit from the lobby , this was a fantastic stay . Nicole checked us in and was friendly , and even gave us a high floor with a stunning view of navy pier and the river . The house ##keeping staff was friendly when they brought our towels . The room was clean and we got a great 1 ##pm check ##out compliment ##ary thanks to Nicole . Thanks for a good night in a great hotel . X ##ox ##o [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great experience with my family . Would definitely come back again ! Staff was extremely nice , rooms were excellent , and the beds were so ##oo comfortable that we didn ' t want to get out ! ! ! ! We ' d like to continue using O ##m ##ni for our future vacation ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##ly , clean hotel with good sized rooms . Perfect , central location . Close to transportation and shopping Love ##ly b ##uff ##et breakfast with many choices , reasonably priced for a large city . If you require car parking , the hotel is quite price ##y , but there are other options within a two block radius . [SEP]
1	[CLS] From start to finish the staff were welcoming and available to answer all questions . The rooms were amazing and spacious , there was a high level of clean ##liness , the 28th floor had an amazing view . This was an awesome experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was very clean , the suites were large and the staff was friendly . The location was perfect for us as it is close to shopping and many restaurants . Also , it is only a few blocks from the red - line which we took to a Cubs game at W ##rig ##ley Field . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I took advantage of the Anniversary special , therefore , my room cost $ 11 . 14 . Love ##d it ! My experience at the Conrad Chicago was f ##abulous ! ! Having the lobby on the 20th floor was a surprise . Love ##d the room key was needed to access the residents floors . The room was very tech sa ##v ##vy . Everything controlled at your finger tip . The bed and lining ##s were so luxurious and comfortable . The entire experience was FA ##NT ##AS ##TI ##C ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed the hotel as it was very central , and location was great . Room was a good size , but bed was uncomfortable . There was no bottle opener even asked at reception and nothing available . There are only 2 lifts serving the 19 floors so often end up waiting for the lift for a long time and often full when it arrives . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location close to numerous restaurants and shops . The rooms are large and comfortable . The breakfast is good value and has a nice variety of offerings . The afternoon social is a nice additional touch . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for a night on New years eve . We were going to a party across the street at ST ##K steak ##house so we decided to stay here . It was a nice little hotel in a very happening area . Ki ##nz ##ie and Hubbard street have become great streets for night ##life and this hotel is in the perfect spot . Check in was fast . The rooms were pretty nice . Not to small and the bed was comfortable too . Nice shower and TV also . Close to everything you can possibly need as well as far as location goes . Also offers a great free breakfast in the mornings near the elevators . Nice touch [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel offered all that I ask for ! Would definitely book it again . Bar and restaurant service was outstanding . Room ##s nicely refurbished . Very close to good shopping and fine restaurants . All staff was welcoming ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great stay at the Talbot ##t ! The front desk was f ##abulous and couldn ’ t do enough for us . When we requested things , the staff was quick to respond . Corner rooms are bigger so request that if you are a family . They offered a roll away bed for my son and he slept great ! Bed was comfortable . I would request facing the front and high floor as delivery vehicles could be loud in the morning . Only down side was the pull out couch and mattress could be cleaner . But the rest of the room was im ##ma ##culate ! Great location and we got an amazing rate ! Would definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel in the Loop . We stayed there to celebrate out anniversary . Room was small but ta ##st ##ily furnished , staff was at ##ten ##tive , location great . Great food nearby , saw a show just down the street . Great trip ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile this week for a business conference and was highly impressed with the friend ##liness of the staff , clean ##liness of the hotel , and the amazing location right on Michigan Avenue . The rooms were a good size with very comfortable beds and great views of the busy city . There were compliment ##ary water bottles supplied and a variety of snack ##s and drinks for purchase in the fridge . The hotel was only about a 20 - minute walk to Millennium Park where the Bean is and there are lots of places to shop and eat nearby . I would definitely stay here again in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent in every aspect ! Room ##s were clean . The staff f ##re ##ind ##ly and helpful and always pro ##mpt when anything was requested . Free breakfast ##s and evening social ##s were wonderful but would like to have had more variety and choices . Again , a superior hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice lobby , very good location in the heart of Chicago . Clean . Staff very pleasant and helpful ##l . Fu ##rn ##iture Room ##s are a little bit " aged " but it is ace ##pta ##ble . Breakfast should be organize as a open b ##uf ##et . Now is a menu chosen . Overall good . Worth to stay . Rat ##io - money to quality of se ##r ##vu ##ce is very good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] - amazing location . We walked a lot . - friendly and efficient staff with lots of helpful recommendations - super clean - great breakfast - loved the afternoon " snack " which was pretty much our dinner most nights . - close to public transport and a trader j ##oes - overall great experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] Well renovated hotel , the bed is not optimal for those was a firm bed . Pi ##llow ##s are a little lump ##y , but deal able . Star ##bu ##cks coffee in the room is a nice feature . The corner room we had was room ##y and comfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff was very friendly and inform ##ative . . . the room was clean and the view was very nice . . . the location was surrounded by excellent stores and great cuisine I would recommend and I will tell my family about this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent hotel . Room beautiful , area beautiful , staff wonderful . Great bed ! Saturday ’ s breakfast was fine . On Sunday , slim picking ##s , no yo ##gu ##rt or banana ##s . 7 ##am opening , no coffee until 7 : 20 ##am . Evening reception just ok , snack ##s were just nuts , Ch ##ex mix fare . In spite of those 2 negative ##s I still recommend staying here . Nice place . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying at this hotel brand and we were very impressed by the quality and value this hotel provides . It is very much like the West ##in , where it ’ s primary focus seems to be guest comfort but with a little more character . A great bed , crisp linen ##s and a very quiet , clean and comfortable room . If you like to use your hotel as a retreat and a place to get a really good nights sleep this is a great hotel to choose . Location is great too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Outstanding and would certainly stay again ! The staff was well trained and customer oriented and the accommodation ##s clean and comfortable . Though we were only there for 2 days and one night , we are already looking forward in scheduling another trip to the city and staying at the Talbot ##t Hotel again soon ! High ##ly recommended , especially if you want to be near Michigan Avenue and Water Tower Place ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Conrad Hilton 101 E . Erie St , Chicago is in a great location , staff were all exceptional . Certainly will stay at this hotel again . Chicago is a really nice city and worth the trip . Abu ##nda ##nt high end restaurants are available . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The elevators are fast , rarely spend time waiting . The rooms are clean , smell nice , linen ##s crisp and the bed is comfortable . This is a great location if you are in Chicago to shop . Be sure to join the rewards program and enjoy free W ##i - Fi and garment pressing . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We had a great time and the staff was very genuine and a tentative to our needs . We had an exceptional greet ##er upon arrival , he made my grand - daughter and friend feel special from the beginning it was so nice . My grand - daughter feels like a queen when she visits the O ##m ##ni in Chicago . As one would not know she doesn ' t have l ##ux ##uries at home and this provides her something of a Cinderella Story . So I thank you for making her feel special as she only feels this once a year when I take her . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I just want to take a minute and shout out Ra ##ul Villa ##rre ##al ! He was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful at the front desk , when I had some specific questions about the area . Because of his hospitality alone , I ’ ll definitely consider re ##book ##ing at the Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Tri ##ed to modify an existing reservation and was constantly transferred , put on hold , or cut off . Long wait times . In ##fle ##xi ##ble policies . And we are Hilton Honors members . Never again ! Hilton needs to put customer service back in their reservation system . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was there for a convention again , but I ' ll write this review as simply a guest . The rooms are very nice . . . . . recently renovated , I ' m told . . . . . and it showed . Everything was up to s ##nu ##ff , working and of quality . The view from the window is spectacular , but it ' s located in an area of the City that everyone has seen at one time or another on TV or the Movies . The staff is very at ##ten ##tive to your needs , very friendly and quick to answer any questions you may have . P ##lent ##y to do nearby ( on foot ) and restaurants are everywhere . Don Shu ##la ' s at the lobby level is always a special place , so don ' t miss that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Pro ##s : 1 . The room was a nice size . 2 . Shu ##la ' s was a nice restaurant and the bartender was friendly and at ##ten ##tive 3 . Club room breakfast was decent but a bit messy . 4 . The gym was good with a nice outside lo ##ung ##ing deck . Con ##s : 1 . Location was not great . Too far from the train station and a long walk to get anywhere . 2 . Focus ##ed on conventions and meetings 3 . Not enough restaurants for its size . 4 . Front desk staff were un ##or ##ganized and often not helpful . 5 . Bart ##ender in the lobby bar was not at ##ten ##tive and not very nice . 6 . Ad ##d 5 minutes for your com ##mu ##te with the elevators . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I have recently stayed here . . . and quite frankly I ' m not sure how to eve ##b write this review . PR ##OS : Amazing pool and fitness center , friendly and welcoming employees , great location near restaurants and shops . CO ##NS : We found 2 huge cock ##roach ##es in our room ( one in the bathroom and one in the room ) . They were killed and removed by the staff . This was extremely disappointing and quite un ##believable . The manager ( Chelsea ) was very a ##pal ##age ##tic and offered us some compensation , which was appreciated . But overall we would never consider staying in this hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here twice for the Chicago marathon and have been very pleased each time . The hotel is very close to the start / finish line and many of the downtown sights . We didn ' t have to rent a car or use the L at any point to get around the city . There are plenty of restaurants in the hotel but also so many more within walking distance . This will definitely be our go - to hotel for many marathon ##s to come . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Unfortunately , it was a big disappointment . Anything which was in the party description was false . There were no high shelf drinks , few app ##eti ##zers and the V ##en ##ue by itself nothing close to the picture provided . A complete waste of $ 150 . Never again I will be back to this hotel New Years party and do not recommend to any of you . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The staff was absolutely amazing and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . I was there for only one night . It was my first time at this hotel but definitely not the last . I look forward to coming back and I hope to get a chance to check out their room service and additional amenities . The room was very comfortable and the bed was wonderful ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sister and I stayed at the Talbot ##t hotel for a few days in no ##ve ##mber . Great hotel . Location is very close to everything but it ' s a very quiet area . The room is big and the beds are so ##oo ##o com ##fy ! We were a bit worried as our room was across the elevator but there was no noise at all from that . The staff is amazing . So friendly and helpful . A big thank you to the door ##men , reception staff and con ##cier ##ge . Next time , I will certainly stay at the Talbot ##t hotel again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location downtown . The hotel and rooms were clean . The staff was extremely friendly . The bed was comfortable . The only down ##side was that my window view was the brick wall of the building next door . Overall , great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was a very nice older style hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago . Walking distance to Millennium Park and theaters . The hotel itself was very cool to walk around and had a lot of history to admire . The room I had was small and the noise levels were pretty loud . You could hear people in the next rooms and outside in the hallway ##s . The winter hotel rates were insane ##ly good . Less than $ 100 a night . I would stay again but try to get an end room with only one neighbor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed in many hotels in Chicago and this is , by far , the best at this price - point . The rooms are H ##U ##GE ( for a city hotel ) . My kids loved the fancy window si ##lls . Our room was extremely clean and we loved the gym . The location is perfect for all things downtown . . . MI Ave , Rush Street , Navy Pier , etc . The staff is spectacular . We will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 6 nights when in Chicago . I arrived quite late after a long journey and the front of house staff were so friendly . The hotel itself is in a great central location , close to everything you want to see and do as well as ideal for the blue line transfer from O ’ Hare . The room was spot ##less and I loved the $ 1 dollar o ##yster ##s every day as well as the free wine tasting ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place , had a lot to do in the surrounding area so I never ran out of places to walk . There ' s also a few shops and restaurants attached if you don ' t want to explore or if you ' re in a pinch . Cam Newton stayed here so look out for other celebrities [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family and I had rooms # 33 ##10 and # 33 ##12 - club level . It was the perfect choice for our family . Lots of outlets in each room to charge electronics . Spa ##cious . Only down ##side I would say is the bathroom ##s needed re - g ##rout ##ing . They looked dirty . Being on the club level gave use access ##es to breakfast and snack ##s throughout the day . Good ass ##ort ##ment of items for all family members . The hotel itself is massive . Lots of eat ##ery choices . All staff members were court ##eous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a lovely hotel in terms on am ##bian ##ce . The rooms are on the small side but certainly service ##able and in good repair . The restaurant attached to the restaurant is also quite nice and the hotel staff are te ##rri ##fic , they managed to check me in at 8 ##am before a 10 ##am business meeting I had ( tip - if you are early at the airport call to the hotel and see if they can hold a room for you , when I called there were only 2 available and they glad ##ly held one for me for early check in ) . Only complaint is the very slow moving elevators - and when one finally gets to your floor it is likely to be full . I made use of stairs but be forward ##ed if you travel with heavy luggage you aren ' t willing to carry . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would give it 5 stars if the rooms were upgraded , it ' s a little dated . The location can not be beat , walk to Michigan Ave shopping , walk to North Shore restaurants . The service is great , and the club lounge is huge with a great breakfast . The bar seen is never happening , been coming here since it opened . I will be back . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Drop ##ped my wife off at the Hilton Chicago to check - in with the booking details , passport and booking credit card while I returned our rental car . They would not let her check in unless I was present as the booking was on my name . Despite calling and talking to me on the phone they still did could not let her check in . After I arrived and we que ##ued for a third time ( 20 min ##s each ) they looked at me and check in without looking or confirming my identity . Didn ' t even looked at my passport , just that I was a male . Sex ##ist . S ##po ##ke to the manager and got brushed off . Good hotel if you wanted to check in and not have your wife know or access the room . Make sure you put your wife ' s name on the Hotel details and won ' t be getting into the room if she has a lost key . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I would recommend this hotel for its location , price , and overall quality . The location is fantastic , just off Michigan Avenue . The breakfast was good , the staff was excellent , and the rooms were spacious . On the down ##side , the elevators were always crowded , the rooms are a little dated , and the hotel was a bit cramped . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great option for a solo travel ##er . The pool on the 19th floor made for a great morning swim with a wonderful view . Breakfast was always good but the wa ##ffles were not offered on Saturday morning . I enjoyed my stay and the kitchen staff were always very welcoming . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Older hotel - rooms a bit tired but the staff is remarkable . Had a nice size room - 2 chairs double sink in bath but NO C ##L ##OS ##ET - asked to switch to room with closet - I got a closet but a smaller room - one sink and one chair [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent ! The staff and managers were wonderful during our groups recent stay . They went out of their way to make our group feel special and very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to our group . I would definitely recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Room ##s are nice . Co ##zy little bar / restaurant . If you don ' t like the feel or a big , convention type hotel , this is for you . D ##wayne at the the front door is very helpful and friendly . Check in was quick , and friendly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Fair ##mont Millennium Park is a beautiful hotel right the in middle of everything . Amazing view ( we were o . n ##T ##he 11th floor ) and could see Lake Michigan . The room itself was pretty expensive , if we hadn ' t booked are trip last minute I would have shop ##ped around more . No free w ##if ##i which I thought was strange at such a nice hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All of the stores had their summer merchandise on either sale or clearance . The Water Tower was the best ! ! The stores were packed but it was well worth the crowds and the wait to get the good deals ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave . Just a short cab / u ##ber ride to several local attractions ! The water taxi and architectural tour was an awesome trip and learned about the city as well . We actually got to catch a Cubs game and they W ##ON ! ! It was fantastic ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##W ##ES ##OM ##E Room and lovely staff ! Close to Chicago Yacht Club ! ! Wasn ' t cheap but the cost was justified by the accommodation ##s ! ! Room wasn ' t ready when we checked in and the offer was an additional $ 30 for a room that was ready on a higher floor - that wasn ' t great B ##UT I decided to pay for it because we had no where else to go . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We decided to do a short stay - cat ##ion last minute , wanted a place downtown , and with a great view . Park ##ing was very friendly and easy . We had a quick and friendly check - in with Ke ##enan who had a smile and told us about our room , and amenities . Our room had a great view of Navy Pier and the Chicago River . It seemed that any room would have a great view of the city . The rooms were beautiful and clean , with what seems to be newer design and Chicago style . We were very convenient ##ly located to walking around downtown hot spots , restaurants , shopping , park . Would be happy to stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and I recently stayed here for 8 nights . The hotel has a wonderful location . You cannot get bored . The room was very spacious and clean . House ##keeping was always on top of things . There is a bar at the entrance . People working there and the breakfast area in the morning are very friendly and welcoming . There is coffee in the room . W ##i ##F ##i was spot ##ty and we had to make a few trip till it was sorted out . I really like the hotel and will definitely stay here the next time we are in Chicago . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel itself was very nice and great location . The food at the restaurant was also good . The staff were beyond friendly . I didn ’ t like that there was a resort fee - as it ’ s a bout ##ique hotel , not a resort . Also the bed was very hard and uncomfortable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I came into town for a bachelor ##ette party . I had a superior queen room that was spacious and well maintained . Staff was amazing - very court ##eous and at ##ten ##tive . The room service breakfast was divine . Many nice restaurants and bars in walking stance . A stones throw from some excellent shopping and close to the red ##line . The lake is just down the street . I cannot emphasize how wonderful this place is . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We spent 2 nights at the hotel and enjoyed everything about the hotel . They take care of people . They have a happy hour starting at 5 ##pm with some light snack ##s to eat . Our room was quiet and spacious for 3 people . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean , modern spacious room . Love ##ly bathroom soap ##s and giant t ##v . In a great area , very close to the beach . Would bring my family back here , although I was on a business trip this time . Air conditioning worked well in rooms , but hallway ##s were hot . Cut ##e restaurants next door but I did not try them . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for three nights . Wonderful service at reception and con ##cier ##ge . Bed ##s were totally heaven soft du ##vet the sleep quality was first class . Floor 10 nice and quiet . Bar area beautiful with a nice co ##sy atmosphere too . Love ##d it and thank you to all the f ##abulous staff for making our visit special . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a great hotel just off the magnificent mile in Chicago . Just off the banks of lake Michigan we couldn ' t have been happier with our choice . We checked in very early but there was a room available at the time , not an issue , we had breakfast in the well appointed restaurant which offered a b ##uff ##et or al a cart ##e . We went the latter were pleased . Once we finished a room was available . The staff assisted with the moving of our luggage and 5 minutes later we were in our well appointed room . the Bed and Bath ##room were great . Each room comes with a PC , ours was fault ##y but we used the W ##i ##F ##i so it wasn ' t an issue . The is a very nice bar but didn ' t drink there . Overall , we happily stay again if we were ever in Chicago . Great location and staff . Very happy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie Hotel has an excellent location just minutes from The Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , numerous restaurants , and beautiful views of the city and its water ##ways . Had a nice Continental breakfast served on our floor every day , room was very clean , and comfortable . Very helpful staff . Would give the hotel a 5 - star rating , but it was a little noisy at times and the walls were not real thin , but thin enough to hear loud conversations in the room next door ( especially at 2 am ) . But overall an excellent hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel isn ' t the most updated hotel , however , the comfort of the rooms is well above average . It was a little price ##y , but I believe what it lacked in aesthetics it made up in customer service . The service of every staff member was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble ! I attended a conference and the facility was also well above average . The location was perfect on Michigan Avenue . I would definitely consider using this hotel again if the rate was within my range for personal use . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean , pleasant room . Co ##zy restaurant . House ##keeping super nice . Could have used more chairs in suite . Very convenient location : close to entertainment , restaurants , and shopping . Windows blocked noise from street . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always come back to this property in Chicago and are generally very pleased with So ##fit ##el run hotels . This one in Chicago is magnificent . Spot ##less and welcoming , comfortable rooms , great bar and breakfast . The staff are knowledge ##able , polished and very friendly . Oz ##lem at the front desk treated us like family . Very helpful , welcoming and so sharp . It ’ s a re ##f ##reshing pleasure to be greeted by a staff member that is so eager to make you feel comfortable . The de ##cor and flowers in the lobby are also beautiful . Excellent central location with so many great places to eat and visit nearby . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I found Hotel All ##egro on ##T ##rip ##A ##d ##visor and decided to give it a try . Boy , did I make a great choice . Hotel staff , room and amenities were top notch . Room was very clean and nicely decorated . Love ##d the extra touches of the in room yoga mat and the raid the bar card . Travel ##ed with my pet and he was was treated like a prince . P ##lent ##y of attention was given to us and to him . Our stay was ma ##rve ##lous . Have already recommended Ho ##el All ##egro to friends and family . Will stay there again and again when in Chicago . Also , great location . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wen ##t to celebrate our wedding anniversary with hub ##by . I reserved a room with a view with Chicago river with a note that we ' re celebrating our special day there , they upgraded me to a suite with compliment ##ary champagne and cup ##cakes - what a nice surprise ! De ##fin ##ite ##ly made our day extra special . Thank you for being so consider ##ate . I had stayed in the Kim ##pton hotels in multiple cities - I was never disappointed . highly recommended . Also the pet friendly policy ##is a super plus . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We visited this hotel during our stay in Chicago to see the play Hamilton . The common areas are very hip and cool , but the rooms were just average . Bo ##ring de ##cor , nice bathroom but very small tub ##s . Would definitely try another hotel next time we visit Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is perfectly located , beautifully appointed and overall a great place to stay in Chicago . The staff could not have been nice ##r . Our room overlooked the city from the 25th floor and everything was comfortable . The hotel ' s bar is a great place to un ##wind at the end of the day with excellent and friendly servers . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , awesome room & outstanding staff ! We were very pleased with con ##cier ##ge service - Cat ##ely ##n guided us well ! We also enjoyed br ##unch & evening drinks / app ##eti ##zers at the attached restaurant - food was very good ! This was our first time at a Kim ##pton Hotel . . . we will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Like staying with family . They treat you like family . But they need to update . The furniture in the lobby was in need of replacement . We could not have been treated better . The location is great . We will be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here in September . Had a suite on 12th floor . Great space , air ##con ##dition ##ed and kitchen with fridge and small freeze ##r . Love ##ly , friendly staff . Breakfast included . Evening meal , Mon to T ##hur ##s compliment ##ary also . Things such as a lovely fresh salad bar , na ##cho ##s , cheese and bi ##s ##cu ##its . Wine and beer also . Would highly recommend it , near Navy Pier ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My only grip ##e is that the room the ##rm ##ost ##at had two settings - too hot or too cold . To their credit , when I asked about it they sent an engineer to my room immediately to check on it . Molly O ' Brien ' s pub is a " Don ' t Miss ! " A selection of Irish W ##his ##key that I have never seen elsewhere , great staff and atmosphere . Location is great and amenities are excellent . So , overall Excellent . I would stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are beautiful , beds are new and heavenly , friendly staff , this is really right in the middle of everything - absolutely perfect location . Access to Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile shopping , River North , South Loop . We will be back often . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ra ##shaw ##n assisted me even with my own cell phone - email problem . I hope that he will receive an accommodation . If there is a raise or another higher level job - this would be your person . He is especially brilliant in his computer skills . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Ra ##quel is a great person who does speak Spanish in the hotel , she helped me and my father to check - out on June 28th and also on July 4th and was there to handle any problems / issues . The view on the 18th floor and room 1820 had a great view , and also the 11th floor and room 111 ##6 had the view as well [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms have the potential to be amazing with a little more care . The staff needs to be trained to be more at ##ten ##tive to guests . The v ##alet was off smoking when we arrived and we had to ask for the bell ##man to take our bags . Room service took over an hour to arrive in the middle of the afternoon and we had to cancel so we wouldn ' t be late to a wedding . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel in a good location . Close to " L " stops , several restaurants nearby , though being in the Loop , many smaller and chain restaurants were closed for the weekend . Room & bathroom were a bit small , but very clean . Only down ##side was thin walls . . . could hear neighbors and hallway noise very clearly . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It would be nice to have a listing of TV channels in the room . Very nice TV but I had to surf all the channels to find a few of my favorite networks . Perhaps I missed it or perhaps the guide was on the remote control ? We liked receiving 2 free drink tickets and the lounge and lobby were very attractive . We had a great experience at your hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location is excellent , rooms provide great views of the lake . The dated carpet in the room was less than desirable . The bed and linen ##s were clean and comfortable . When booking online make sure you account the amenities fee that my not be disclosed during your initial booking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic customer service . Very nice and clean hotel . Great location . Within walking distance of almost everything . Ph ##eno ##men ##al bar downstairs . Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Only down ##side is that the bed and pillows weren ’ t overly comfortable but the rest of the experience more than made up for it ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We flew into Chicago from UK on route to San Francisco . Had 2 nights at this hotel . B ##rill ##iant location , so central and convenient for all the sights . Beautiful hotel inside with very comfortable rooms . Staff were friendly and helpful . Reason ##ably priced as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] What an AM ##A ##Z ##ING hotel ! We loved our spacious , quite , clean & comfortable room ! Thank you to Jim , Gabe , Javier , Jason & La ##T ##on ##ja for making our stay perfect ! The staff was great , re ##sp ##ons ##ive & helpful ! We loved our view & the awesome service ! Great location & we appreciated the grab & go breakfast bags too . Our room was very quiet & there were a lot of people in the hotel . Thank you for also keeping us safe with your CO ##VI ##D pre ##ca ##ution ##s during this challenging time ! We highly recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] While the hotel and staff were nice , there are many newer more modern hotels in the area . There wasn ' t anything that particularly stood out about the O ##m ##ni , as such for the cost of the O ##m ##ni I would probably recommend the Ki ##nz ##ie to people looking for a Hotel in the area . Not ##ably missing from the O ##m ##ni ' s services were a guest Happy Hour / Wine hour with complementary drinks , also missing was a breakfast option as well . As with most O ##m ##ni ' s except the newly built ones , it is a decent ##ly updated nice , but older hotel , that doesn ' t really stand out . Also a few items in the room didn ' t function as expected [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location just a few steps off the Golden Mile . Un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly clean and well - lit rooms with big floor to ceiling windows all across a long wall . Everything was im ##ma ##culate . P ##lent ##y of closet space . First cabin coffee maker . R ##oof top bar . Fast , fast elevators . This is on the short list , as far as i am concerned . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed only for one night but it was in a great location , had v ##alet parking , and was easy to check in . The room was large with a great view and a huge bathroom and lots of nice amenities like black out blind ##s , N ##es ##press ##o machine , and great products in the bathroom . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great rooms , great staff , appreciated that there was a coffee maker in the room . Con ##cier ##ge desk and bell hop desk both extremely helpful and friendly . Clean ##ing staff very polite and friendly . Check in and Check out went smoothly without any issues . I was attending a conference while I was there so the only down ##side was the rooms were on 4 different floors and it was easy to get a little lost . But they put staff at key areas on the first day to point us in the right direction . Overall great experience , and great location for tourists , near Millennium Park . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect location for food , shopping and sight seeing . The rooms were a nice size and very clean , friendly and helpful staff that accommodate ##d me with extra robes and champagne glasses whilst getting ready for my wedding . Would recommend and stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was pleasant ##ly surprised by this property b ##c of all the negative reviews . Our suite was quite nice . . perhaps a little out ##dated , but still nice . They are in the process of re ##nova ##ting all room to be completed by Spring 2018 . The service was imp ##ec ##ca ##ble from the moment we arrived at the front desk , to house ##keeping , the con ##cier ##ge , in - room dining , as well as the restaurants . . The Ta ##p and the Millennium room where we ate breakfast . High ##ly recommend this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Intercontinental needs a re ##furbishment and mainly and urgent ##ly in the bathroom ##s . The clean ##liness of the bathroom ##s is not the one you can expect in an Intercontinental . Good location and good breakfast [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was very excited to start my family holiday in this hotel - but I was very di ##sa ##point ##ed what I got . The room smelled and the hotel a ##c was so loud I did hear the room a ##c at all . The bathroom was nice and clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed her many times . It ' s a good location for the downtown river area in Chicago . The staff is very at ##ten ##tive . Check ##in took awhile but they were slammed and there were only 2 check ##in clerk ##s . The hotels rooms are in dire need of up ##dating . The beds were sa ##ggy and the plea ##ther was p ##eel ##ing off the furniture . Once those things are updated I would return . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I recently stayed at this hotel when in town to visit family and friends . My room was lovely and very comfortable . This has been a long time favorite place of mine . I like the neighborhood and its proximity to the lake ##front for nice walks . Breakfast was delicious and dinner in the restaurant was excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] F ##lew in on a red eye from California and was exhausted when I got to the hotel . The front desk staff ( I wish I got his name ) was able to get me a room as soon as possible and was able to rest and enjoy my day I ’ m Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for a conference and it is really a beautiful hotel . My room was really nice with a separate bedroom . The restaurant and lounge on the 4th floor had good food . Like all higher end hotels , water in room was expensive at $ 7 ! I really had this type of go ##ug ##ing . Other than that , a great hotel in a great location . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel Monaco is certainly a nice , clean hotel , but I wasn ' t over impressed based on expectations . For some reason , I was under the impression this was a luxury , bout ##ique brand . While room sizes were large , which I don ' t care about anyway , the rooms felt dated with s ##tale designs . With the exception of the nice ch ##ais ##e lounge and pillows , there was nothing in the room that stood out . The lobby area was nice , but felt kind of like a H ##ya ##tt Place and the morning spread was kind of forced into a hallway . I have had much better experiences in other Kim ##pton Hotels , such as the Al ##egro , at lower prices . I will say the gym is ok , but there were some nice work out suggestions I was able to take advantage of . Overall thought , this experience just wasn ' t memorable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t was excellent in both service and value . The tea selection in the morning was a nice touch , and the overall property was very clean and well maintained . Look forward to my next Chicago trip ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] From the moment we arrived at the front desk , they made every attempt to make us feel special . We had a corner room . It was a great view ! Super nice , plus ##h room . Very clean , I ' m a bit of a crazy person about this . I highly recommend this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is very impressive , to say the least . The rooms are spacious and they even have window seats that can function as a day - bed . Excellent way to over ##look the river and do some work . F ##ac ##ilities are excellent and , although we never used this , they provide bikes for guests to tour the city . The gym is decent but is clean and open 24 hours . The area is pretty financial , so you ' ll have to cross the river for excellent food , but do it because its amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Price ##s can vary by 300 % depending on demand , trade shows , etc . worth considering due to location and if not over ##p ##rice ##d . Te ##rrible w ##if ##i that has no bandwidth . Breakfast a la cart . Good service . Nice shower . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and at ##ten ##tive desk staff . Made our stay safe and convenient for all day working experience downtown on film location . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting the crew vehicle out front was a time save ##r and mad our load - in and load - out at the location next door simple and pain ##less . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Really enjoyed our stay . We arrived to a very warm welcome from Erin , who was amazing . Our suite was f ##ab and really spacious . The view from our window was f ##ab , t ##rump tower and w ##rig ##gle buildings . Beautiful at ni ##te . The breakfast was very ta ##sty and the social nights Monday to Thursday were at great addition and surprise , ta ##sty snack ##s , wine and beer , free from 17 . 00 to 19 . 00 [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Mill ##eni ##um K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker is the perfect location for a family reunion ; easy access to theater , museums and restaurants . The bed was wonderful ##ly comfortable . Our suite included a Japanese soaking tub and separate shower . I rate the room 4 out of 5 because it lacks a makeup mirror . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at the O ##m ##ni a number of times and have enjoyed my experiences . That is , until today . The room I received was not cleaned properly . There were clothes from the previous guest in the floor in the corner and It does not look like the carpet was even vacuum ##ed . Really disappointing and will think twice before booking here again . At the very least , the room should be spot ##less , especially for a 4 . 5 star hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice renovation . Good breakfast and evening social . Pool area uncle ##an and no clean towels even upon request . 1 of 2 elevators out of order , so long waits with 19 floors . Over ##charged , but resolved quickly . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was exceptional ! ! On entrance it was so welcoming ! The manager Travis was so polite and helpful in our arrived he made me and my friends feel so welcome . The room was so pretty ! I would recommended to any of my friends , it ’ s a must stay hotel as it ’ s only a 5 minute work it the meter which brings u straight to downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed at the O ##m ##ni on 5 / 20 . We enjoyed the location because it was very close to shopping and lots of restaurants . We walked all around the area . . . . all the way back from W ##rig ##ley . It was a long walk but loads of fun . So much to see in Chicago . We had drinks in the bar and they were great . Room was re ##mo ##del ##ed , bed comfortable , love the suite concept ! Will definitely stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker for the first time this Spring and were very happy with our choice . The staff was very persona ##ble , friendly and at ##ten ##tive . The room was very clean and serviced on time , disc ##reet ##ly . The bar , while small , had a good offering of choices at a fairly reasonable price , and the bar staff was also very helpful and nice ( though the bar can be a little chill ##y ) . Excellent location for shopping . We will keep the property on our short list for Chicago trips ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a delight ##ful stay at this " medium sized " River North Hotel . . The location is te ##rri ##fic - - walking distance to almost everything and just slightly offs ##ite from the congestion and noise of Michigan Ave . The room was im ##ma ##culate and spacious . Most importantly , the staff was incredibly ho ##sp ##ita ##ble . De ##met ##rie checked us in and made a f ##abulous first impression on us - - he made us feel welcome and appreciated . He is a total star on the staff . We will return to Swiss ##ote ##l and highly recommend ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly . I loved that we were able to drop our bags off before check - in as well . We came into tow for a baseball game and the game started before check - in . It was extremely busy while we were there , and the elevators were packed nearly every time we rode them and the A / C unit wasn ' t particularly quiet but other than that the stay was really wonderful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] All staff from check in to check out were outstanding in their service and friendly ##ness . I was greeted as if I were returning home by everyone on the lobby level . Room was clean , service was outstanding . Can ' t wait to return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just checked in . The hotel is gorgeous ! Please see the photos that I attached . Also got a upgrade to a lake view room ! That ’ s one of the most view I have had in Chicago . My room has two bathroom ##s which makes my kids so happy . Special thanks to Julius Do ##xy , who did a great job helping us at the check in ! High ##ly recommended ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Friendly check in staff most welcoming after 20 + h ##rs travelling from Brisbane . Love ##ly view from our room . We found con ##cier ##ge always pleasant and helpful . The location is great and we would stay here again without hesitation . Picture attached is the view from room 170 ##3 . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I really enjoyed my stay here ! Co ##m ##fort ##able , updated rooms . Good service . Great location . I appreciated the staff at con ##cier ##ge and they were happy to store my bags for the day . And the best part ? Free breakfast AND dinner , with drinks ! What a great deal . I would love to stay here again with my family . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellent accommodation ##s and service for my wife and i . We cannot think of the better place to stay to be central to all that happens in Chicago . We had a wonderful view of the Chicago River and the City while enjoying the qualities of a five star hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We always stay here ! Fast and easy check in . We are always impress d with the accommodation ##s at the kn ##icker ##bo ##cker ! A ##wes ##ome hotel and the rooms are clean and bed is so comfortable ! Best hotel in Chicago ! We also love the bar . You can relax and have a cocktail ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We greatly enjoyed our weekend stay at the O ##m ##ni Chicago . The rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel restaurant was great . The breakfast . . . . . . . . . . w ##ow . Even our very pick ##y , young children had plenty to eat ! We are looking forward to staying there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you want convenience of shopping , this is a great place to stay . The ma ##je ##stic great hall was filled with extra loud music and I had to change rooms at 113 ##0 ##pm due to buzzing noise that came on every 20 minutes Got moved to another room that was worse - train noise Also the bathroom had mild ##ew and toilet was broken . Sin ##k and console so old and falling apart . The hotel gave me a discount for my trouble but I would never stay there and pay that kind of money . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Home ##wood Suite ##s made for an easy , convenient stay off of Michigan Avenue . The room was clean and spacious , happy hour and compliment ##ary breakfast was great . My only issue was at check in . I arrived after the 4 p . m . check in time , but my room was still not ready . My ##self and many others had to wait in the lobby until our rooms were ready . The staff was very a ##pol ##og ##etic and court ##eous to make sure we were taken care of though . Also , I wished the pool was in working order as it was closed during a week of 95 degree heat , so it would have been nice to be able to use that advertised am ##eni ##ty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room and location was great . Not ##ice ##able change in hospitality with new management . Eliminated a very welcoming compliment ##ary continental breakfast and replaced with a me ##dio ##cre menu to purchase from . Have stayed there many times and felt the change in management . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have used this property multiple times for work and personal trips . I have never been disappointed , the property is clean and spacious . It ' s in a great location , you can walk most places and you feel safe ! The meetings and conventions staff were so helpful and flexible , by far one of the best service hotels I have worked with ! The go above and beyond not only for the event staff , but for my attendees too . The food is outstanding , not your average banquet food , my team was really impressed . The front desk staff were friendly and welcoming . The sleeping rooms were good size , clean and updated . Each room has a good view of either the river , lake or the park . I don ' t have any complaints , I would recommend this property to everyone whether its a personal or work trip ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] New ##ly updated rooms . Very trend ##y and modern but I like the " old " Talbot ##t feel better . Location is outstanding for shopping and dining around the gold Coast . The bar is very nice with a good selection of drinks . T ##H ##e rooms are a bit small but very clean and new . I would highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights . It ' s a cute hotel and clean . It is in a great location for shopping , restaurants , Navy Pier , etc . My reason for a 4 and not a 5 is because there was no room service , the door ##man often didn ' t get the door , and the front desk staff was me ##dio ##cre . However , the cleaning staff was really friendly and kind . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Thanks to Nicole , the process for booking a room late and last minute , went effort ##lessly . Answer ##ed all the questions asked and then some . Present ##ed herself professionally and was friendly at the same time . Couldn ’ t have asked for better service . Thank you Nicole ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Palmer House is a comfortable and convenient hotel in downtown Chicago . I spent two nights here recently . My room was small but comfortable . The room was looking a bit tired , and I found the hallway ##s c ##lut ##tered with rub ##bish from guests and the occasional loose wall panel . The lobby and check - in / out can be very busy at peak times - it is a large hotel . Overall it ' s comfortable . There ' s quite a bit to do around the area as well [SEP]
1	[CLS] I appreciated the court ##eous staff and a class ##y , s ##ty ##lish facility . Unfortunately , the " pet friendly " designation resulted in dogs being present throughout the lobby and in The Library ( one of their two restaurants ) during breakfast , and frequent barking from an adjacent room was annoying . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed right around the Christmas weekend . My husband is a platinum with SP ##G and we were upgraded to the Presidential suite and had an adjoining room for our teen boys . The suite is absolutely beautiful . It has amazing 180 degree views from Navy Pier to the River . The location is perfect , it ' s removed from the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le of Michigan Avenue but still super close to walk to most of the action . I have stayed at a lot of hotels in the city but this one is my absolute favorite . The executive lounge is very nice and the entire hotel is absolutely kid friendly . When you have kids you can ' t beat staying at the She ##rato ##n . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed on the 31st floor with access to lounge on the 33rd . Room was spacious , clean , nicely appointed , beautiful view . Hotel is close to everything , including Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . It ’ s a standard nice , chain , city hotel room and I would stay here again . Su ##gg ##est higher floors just because of the view . Only down ##side was we had to look at the T ##R ##UM ##P logo across the river . . . but that ’ s no fault of the hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] With my first visit to Chicago I didn ' t know what to expect . My friend had recommended this hotel to me and before I travelled I checked out the location and it seemed central for what I wanted to see . This hotel did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint . From the entrance to the hotel room itself I loved every second of my stay . Re ##ception staff were extremely helpful and the con ##cier ##ge too ( as I tried to find my feet every day ! ) . This hotel is about 10 min ##s walk from the famous " Bean " which is a must visit when you come to Chicago . It was also about a 10 - 15 min ##s walk from most tourist attractions like Buckingham Fountain and many others [SEP]
1	[CLS] Here once again after many , many wonderful visits to Chicago . Con ##ven ##ience is the best but not to dim ##ini ##sh the hotel itself or it ’ s amazing staff ! From the front door , to front desk ( Abdul and Frances ) friendly , extremely helpful . We love the window seats in the room . Thank you , Monaco , we will be back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Total ##ly unexpected , Such a beautiful room and hotel for a last minute booking . The pricing was also very affordable . Even came with two compliment ##ary bottles of wine . Amazing ; needed , and booking again soon . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Had a nice stay at the Fair ##mont Hotel in Chicago . The staff was super nice . The bed was comfortable . What was good about the hotel was that I could do everything there . They are connected with another building , so I never had to step foot outside to get a quick bite or go to the post office or fed ##ex . I was there for a conference , so I didn ’ t get to explore all of the amenities . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Even though the weather was chill ##y , the room was co ##zy and warm with a fantastic view of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier ! Would definitely recommend this hotel . Had dinner at Kitty O ’ Shea ##s and the service and the food were both excellent ! A very fun atmosphere ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Cho ##ose a room with a view of the river and you won ' t be disappointed by the enormous , bed like window seat and of course , the view . A compliment ##ary wine hour daily , bike loans , compliment ##ary coffee and tea in the morning , yoga mat ##s , bath robes , and much more are available at this bout ##ique hotel . Great locations - a few blocks from Millennium park , great shopping and steak houses ! All the staff were non - stop friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed one Monday before a meeting at the Fed . , Great location , really enjoyed the 5 ##p prose ##cco . Very pleasant staff , good AC , good toilet ##ries provided , great coffee provided at 6 ##a in the lobby , better than can be br ##ew ##eed in room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel staff was friendly and helpful . Need ##ed to change rooms had other minor issues which were handled very well . Room ##s were what you would expect from a hotel of this caliber . Location is prime and can ' t be beat . [SEP]
0	[CLS] outstanding guest service . I appreciate the staff ##s ability to seek how they can be more a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , especially during the pan ##de ##mic . It seemed with all uncertainty in the day to day , they were very good at asking me questions and checking in . There was always a greeting and good - bye or something that just let me know that they cared . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was literally in the perfect area to suit my needs . Shop ##s and restaurants everywhere . The room was clean and comfortable . I was able to check in early with no hesitation . I ' ve never stayed at a hotel that offered a compliment ##ary drink for a stay and the food was delicious . I have already recommended the hotel to people as well as 20 East . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was very friendly and helpful . The hotel is nice and clean and the views were amazing . Location is awesome . On the mornings I put do not disturb , they still left a message to let them know if I needed anything . 12 / 10 would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In general the hotel is dated . Ce ##iling Show ##er Head not working as it should due to lime ##sca ##le In room safe doesn ’ t work Show ##er floor is disgusting I coffee pod it ’ s what ’ s left in your room no cream just dairy powder The cleaning is also un ##iff ##icient and make sure your room door is properly closed as for twice was left open The reception ##ist on duty on the night of 20 / 8 was really a charm not providing any further information than saying no I ’ m sorry Not good at all [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed here for 4 nights as a family of six . 4 in a double room and two in a king room . Hotel was beautiful and rooms were large enough to accommodate . ( Bath ##room a little small ) . Service was great apart from the little hi ##cc ##up when checking in and over charged fees , but was all sorted . Love ##d Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really enjoyed our time at the She ##rato ##n . We upgraded to a river view room facing the city . The staff was very helpful . Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile was easy to walk to . Park ##ing garage below the hotel was so easy to get to , in , and out of . The only issue we had was the phone would ring once or twice until midnight . I un ##p ##lug ##ged it at that time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I come here anywhere from 2 to 8 times a year . Have never had a bad experience . Hotel is always clean and staff is always very friendly . This has been my go to hotel for years and it will continue to be for a long time . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great price since it was half as much as The Drake which was right across the street . Great Location since we were one block away from one of the best beaches in Chicago and the double deck ##er bus pickup . Great Service . Only thing is they don ' t do a good job of letting you know the internet is not free and cost almost $ 12 a day . But when I brought it up they glad ##ly re ##fu ##nded me . Great hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a nice hotel in a fantastic location with spacious rooms , friendly staff & a lobby bar complete with jazz trio ##s at night and a pianist earlier in the evening . It is a block from Michigan Ave and situated within walking distance of most main attractions . The slow elevator was the only down ##side and that is to be expected in an old hotel I believe . Bath ##rooms are nice size with beautiful walk in shower . Great spot ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] T ##ruly amazing - from the check in process to the check out process , everything was fl ##aw ##less ! Such an expert team that truly is the e ##pit ##ome of hospitality ! I wish it wasn ' t so cold outside , but it was always a great feeling to know I had a warm friendly hotel to come " home " to . The entire Con ##cier ##ge staff is a dream - please visit them for the best insights to what Chicago has to offer you . They are all Les C ##le ##fs d ' Or members , so you know they are THE B ##ES ##T ! Stevie at the bar also deserves a mention , she is a GE ##M ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Odd ##ly - shaped ( triangular looking from the top ) makes for oddly - shaped corner rooms . Otherwise , there is nothing remarkable about this hotel . Service ##able for business conferences , I suppose . But , if you are traveling for pleasure , there are better bet ##s . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was friendly and helpful . Lots of elevators to get back to room . Location is outstanding to visit the Museum Campus , go to the parks or just take in the city . The L stops nearby . Room was always well cleaned . Best part was our room had two bathroom ##s ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My partner and I planned a long weekend pleasure trip to Chicago . We chose the Public on word of mouth recommendation , and we were not disappointed . The hotel is an excellent location , easy to get everywhere by car or subway . The welcome we received was efficient and g ##rac ##ious , and the room was spacious and clean , and super quiet . Everyone throughout the hotel was helpful , and items we asked for ( additional towels , etc ) were delivered promptly . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Absolutely St ##un ##ning Hotel . Service was spectacular from beginning to end . Room was im ##ma ##culate and provided all the amenities possible . Staff was welcoming and helpful . I will definitely return to this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was so beautifully re ##mo ##del ##ed . The staff , especially Ramsey was awesome and the Sky bar gets a 5 from me ! Please take the time to visit if your in the Chicago area . You will be pleased with your stay and the clean ##liness of the rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is lovely . The staff provided pro ##mpt and helpful service . Food is out if this world . The breakfast b ##uff ##et is average and they have a problem getting it open by 6 : 30 . However , the people at the Conrad care for their customers . I will definitely return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed in several of the North Michigan hotels over the years . This is the best overall . The rooms were considerably above the norm , the bar and cafe on the 20th floor were great place to meet . We will be going back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at this hotel several times & have always had the same experience . This hotel is all about customer service . Every employee greet ##s you and interact ##s with you . The hotel rooms are larger in size as compared to other downtown hotels . There are amenities in the rooms that are often taken for granted , such as an umbrella or a l ##int brush . The views of the downtown area are breath ##taking . The hotel is convenient ##ly located to the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile , Millennium Park or Navy Pier . The food at the hotel is definitely worth it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent overall . Room ##s could use some up ##dating perhaps a bit more color . Gold experience was fine , bad was fine , housekeeper was excellent . Excellent job by all . Give our thanks to all involved Ross P Alan ##der [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a f ##abulous hotel in a great location ! They greeted us each time we returned from our day , and I appreciated the extra ##s ( W ##IF ##I , birthday treat , coffee in the morning , and fresh water all day , plus the little wine tasting at 5 . ) We had a spacious double room with views of the river . The window seats were delight ##ful and the room feels large with high ceilings . The hotel lobby is charming and smells amazing . The beds were comfortable with clean , fresh towels . The best feeling is this bout ##ique hotel feels small , warm , and inviting unlike many of the me ##ga hotels in CH ##I . I can ' t wait to stay there again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bus ##y hotel with friendly professional staff as a minimum . Te ##rik B on reception and Bernard at the Con ##cier ##ge stand out . If you ' re staying in Chicago - you need a decent hotel and this one get ' s it right . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel right by the park . The room is really nice and the bed comfortable . The only con is you have to sign up for their rewards program to get free W ##i ##F ##i . Bath ##rooms are large and spacious and the TV is nice too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We have stayed here seven times . The staff is at ##ten ##tive , rooms comfortable and the location great . If you find yourself there on a Friday afternoon at 3 : 00 pm go to the historic tour of the property . You won ' t be disappointed ! Great bar as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently hosted my staff holiday party in The Gallery room located in this hotel . It was such a nice and welcoming space for our small team of 15 , but it definitely has capacity for double that . Staff were super at ##ten ##tive to us from start to finish and made sure our time there was pleasant . Being a nonprofit we had to work with a fairly modest budget , and the events team accommodate ##d us with ease . I ' ll definitely be back in the future for other events . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ' s a nice option to trade in your times ##hare for a hotel room . However , the disadvantage is not being able to receive a similar size room that is like your times ##hare exchange . The location to many venues and the ability to not need a car to get to different venues was a huge benefit . Yet , not having a kitchen or a big enough room and bathroom was a little difficult for a week stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The ambassador hotel is a beautiful historical hotel in an absolutely f ##abulous location . I like what they ' ve done in the downstairs bar area but it is very hot down there in the summer ##time , especially because they ' re doing construction in the restaurant . We stayed in a suite , which was basically just two regular size rooms adjoining . Our bathroom was absolutely tiny so do not expect anything grand if you stay in a suite . My biggest complaint is that the IN ##TE ##R ##NE ##T IS T ##ER ##RI ##BL ##E , I literally could not download anything . I had to go to the Star ##bu ##cks down the street to download something that I tried to download for three full days at the hotel , and at Star ##bu ##cks it downloaded in five minutes . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great and engaging staff , perfect location , awesome bar on site for a night cap . The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable . My wife loves that the bathroom had a separate heat ##er and I thought the shower was amazing . Big shower head and great water pressure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just wanted to share this info to make someone else ' s stay more pleasant . . . Air conditioning in room didn ' t work ( said it was set to 65 but was sweating at night ) . Try to avoid the front desk and check in / out on your phone , not sure if the staff isn ' t trained yet or what the deal is but simple tasks took way too long ( checking in and checking out each took over 10 min which is unacceptable for such an easy operation ) . I was never email ##ed my bill even though I asked for it , and then looked at my credit card to see that I was charged for the incorrect amount . Just such a has ##sle when I was looking for an easy 1 night stay . Will not be going back [SEP]
1	[CLS] My stay at the Swiss ##ote ##l was very comfortable and the food for the conference was excellent . Best of all , the staff was very friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting , and I was especially impressed by the lovely housekeeper , Erica . When I returned to my room while she was working in it , she very politely asked me to use my key to verify it was my room - excellent security check . We then had an enjoyable chat . . . it was so nice to meet a young lady who so cares about her client ##ele ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay the She ##rato ##n Grand Chicago . I was told that would get a guest room on a high floor ( 29th ) that had been renovated because of my Mar ##riot ##t Bon ##voy Gold Elite status . I was under ##w ##hel ##med by the room ; however the river view was exceptional . The property is clean , the bar is very good , and the staff at the L ##B Café is friendly and efficient . This was my first visit to Chicago , and I will certainly come back when it ’ s warmer / . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Chicago Hilton has succeeded beautifully in up ##dating an old hotel effectively while retaining its old charm . This is a hard mix to get right , but they have . Our standard room was huge , had two bathroom ##s , and was thoroughly cleaned by house ##keeping . It ’ s an easy walk to the Art Institute and Millennium Park . But the hotel ’ s deficiency was glaring : food service . Every ##where we went , whether the sit - down restaurant , the bar or the grab and go location , service was a ##by ##sma ##l , multiple mistakes were made and the food was me ##dio ##cre at best . Worst of all , the wait staff were immune to customer complaints about mistaken orders , inter ##mina ##ble delays , missing dishes , overlooked drinks , etc . I suspected the staff fielded so many complaints they barely paid attention anymore . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro staff was top notch from check in to check out . Everyone was so helpful and friendly . The room was nicely decorated and very clean . Great location to restaurants , theater and transportation . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Brian C ##ul ##bers ##on concert at the Fair ##mont Chicago Millennium . Love the Hotel . very clean and modern . The Bar area was very accessible . Bart ##ender ##s were very efficient . Just had a wonderful time . the Hotel Staff was so friendly . I Love to have stayed at the Hotel . everyone I came in contact at the Hotel was court ##eous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nothing really fancy , but a nice central location . Room ##s were small but typical for a big city hotel . Nice ##ly decorated , good bed and linen ##s . Not much of a lobby bar , adjoining breakfast restaurant ( not part of hotel ) . Hotel faces W ##aba ##sh so no view . Staff was very friendly and helpful . Overall , a good experience and good value for the location . Easy walk to central city restaurants and Michigan Ave . shopping . We ' ll use again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I stayed 2 nights in this fine hotel during our first visit to Chicago . . The hotel is located in the city center with walking distance to shopping and recreational areas . . It can be classified as one of the authentic hotels . . Park ##ing is available but relatively expensive . . The lobby is very beautiful . . The room was in 21 floor and it was quite and clean but lacking many amenities . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Rachel is wonderful . I check - in late and Rachel accommodate ##d me in every way possible . She gave me the best room possible , was pleasant , and checked on me once I checked - in . If I could I would hire Rachel away from She ##rato ##n . She really is a jewel . Again Rachel is amazing . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been here several times a year and I don ' t see a lot of renovations going on . Service is good , bed is comfortable , room is clean , etc but nothing special anymore ( other than the view and location ) . It did rain so I found the underground tunnels to be very helpful . Average property , I had an ok rate of $ 450 or so . Any ##more it is not worth the age of the property ( or should say the condition ) . I will stay a ##gin but it is next to my office ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This Hotel really passed many of my expectations , it was clean , it was friendly , it was beautiful . We really enjoyed our room , the bay window to sit in and watch the river below , Trump Towers and the Marina Towers are both across from Hotel Monaco . The window is fitted with a thick comfortable , decorative mattress and huge pillows , I sat for a long while watching below , the pedestrian ##s , the traffic , all . . . it was a great place to rest after hours of walking the city sights ##ee ##ing ! The hotel is in the hub of the city , to many things are nearby to mention . The v ##alet Matt gets special mention for being so awesome to us ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Talbot ##t Hotel was a great place to stay for a few days in the city . Great location ! Coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance . If you are a little ore advent ##urous you can walk down to the lake and do a lot of exploring in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stay at the Fair ##mont Chicago on a regular basis and occasionally upgrade to the gold level . The service and am ##ent ##ies are great . In particular , Man ##dan ##a is always extremely pleasant , helpful and genuinely interested in making my stay as special as possible . She is a huge asset to the hotel property . I sincere ##ly recommend paying the extra charge to upgrade . You won ' t be disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I can ’ t say enough about this hotel . Clean , comfortable rooms , in the heart of downtown Chicago ( close to Michigan Ave , Eat ##aly , great restaurants ) for a very reasonable price . My family also appreciated the free happy hour ( beer , wine and light dinner ) and breakfast . The staff was exceptional and extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My daughter and I stayed at the Conrad for her 16th birthday . The staff went out of their way to accommodate us with a Michigan Avenue room with an awesome view . The location is just steps away from our favorite stores and many great restaurants . Thank you again to the wonderful staff at the Conrad ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my third time staying at Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago . My husband and I really enjoyed the personal hospitality at check in , the spacious room with a great view , and at ##ten ##tive customer service to accommodate my special requests . Swiss ##ote ##l is also well situated for seeing the city - - an easy walk from the Loop , close to the park , across from the River ##walk , and lots of good restaurants in close proximity . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Book ##ed this hotel due to the location . I am a I ##H ##G member and have always wanted to try a Kim ##pton and glad that I did ! Its about a two min walk to the L with access to almost every line . The hotel was very nice , clean , and updated . The rooms were very eccentric and well decorated . Vale ##t parking was $ 58 a night but could be worse I guess . The view was excellent and the staff couldn ' t be better ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff was great . The service was great . The room was great . The location was perfect . Bus ##y taxi area and staff was able to flag one down for me each time in under a minute . W ##if ##i worked everywhere . My room was quiet and nicely decorated . It is a popular place and I was only able to acquire a room for one night during my weekend there . Staff assisted me with my multiple questions about things in the area and were very professional . The check in and out process was quick . The area was nice and I wasn ' t worried walking around at night . There were many locations nearby for food and / or drinks . I loved everything from the comfortable bed to the staff greeting me upon arrival , to the toilet ##ries provided . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything about our stay was perfect ! The room was beautiful , the views were amazing and the Palm restaurant was delicious . . . I live in the Chicago ##land area and sometimes I forget how beautiful our city really is . This was the perfect get ##away from home and we ’ re really able to enjoy the city from our room . I ’ d definitely recommend the Swiss ##ote ##l . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel and staff did an exceptional job at aid ##ing us for our trip . The staff members , especially D ##wayne , made sure we felt at home and worked hard to provide with everything we needed from supplies to information . 10 / 10 would recommend , and my family ’ s definitely coming back for a round 2 at The Talbot ##t Hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Please do try this hotel and enjoy the river view , it ' s an excellent property to stay and enjoy the Chicago Downtown . Everything is good and great about this place . Service is great , rooms are nice and it ' s right in the heart of downtown [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the Palmer House because the photos I ' d seen of the lobby are stunning . And it does not di ##sa ##pp ##oint ! En ##joy a drink at the lobby bar and so ##ak in the decade ##nt furnishings and beautiful high ceilings . The hotel staff were very helpful and professional . Despite the great number of people staying at the hotel , we didn ' t F ##EE ##L them and the hotel was very well managed . Our room was lovely . And the hotel is close to many attractions and events . De ##fin ##ite ##ly a hotel to enjoy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If budget is no concern , and you are looking for a quite and convenient place to rest you head and re ##f ##resh each night , then I definitely recommend that you give the Monaco a look . The staff was very friendly and helpful . The location was super convenient , and the rooms were clean and comfortable . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was so pleased to see someone who enjoyed their job as much as Francisco who worked the morning shift in the breakfast room of the hotel . He was all about service and and even refused a tip ( which he had earned in spa ##des ) because it was his job to make sure we were taken care of . Amazing right ! ? We need more people like him in customer service . Job well done Francisco . # Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile [SEP]
1	[CLS] I love this place ! Beautiful de ##cor ; clean , quiet , and comfortable ( especially the bed and plus ##h robe ) ; great location ; and an extremely friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting staff . The rates are good for this area . I highly recommend Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of downtown , especially if you ' re there to see a show . We saw Phantom of the Opera at the Cadillac Theatre , which is literally just a few steps down the sidewalk . We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary , and the staff went out of their way to make it memorable : free room upgrade , tray of compliment ##ary snack ##s delivered to our room . Grant ##ed , it was a slow night , but still very very thoughtful . Let me say it again : we L ##O ##VE ##D this place ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Though this is not the most modern hotel in the city of Chicago , you simply cannot beat the location . Walking distance to Gibson ' s steak ##house . Walking distance to the magnificent mile . 2 blocks from Lake Michigan . The bathroom in my suite was a ta ##d small . Total ##ly l ##ivable , but some people will find it to be too compact . If you know anything about the history of this hotel , you will understand and appreciate just how cool this place really is . The amount of celebrities who frequented this place back in the day is just un ##ima ##gin ##able . Richard P ##ryo ##r . Frank Sinatra . And the list just keeps on going . It has and will continue to be a hot spot . I can ' t wait to get back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] While the hotel room was fine , I was extremely disappointed about the experience I had after hotel check ##out . I stayed Wednesday to Thursday ( May 8 - 9 ) and on early Saturday morning I realized I had left an expensive evening dress hanging in the closet of the room . I called lost and found , and left a message and no one returned my calls . I called throughout the weekend and was unable to get a hold of anyone . Finally on Monday morning I requested that I be connected to someone in facilities and was able to get through . My dress had not been returned to lost & found by house ##keeping . This lack of integrity at such a highly rated establishment is f ##rust ##rating and I would not stay here again or recommend that anyone else stay here . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel offers an location with big rooms , friendly and helpful staff . They make you feel at home . I would recommend this hotel to my friends . Upon returning to Chicago again this hotel is where I will stay [SEP]
1	[CLS] I went for Labor Day weekend with my twelve year old son . I have been to Chicago many times with friends , but this was the first visit for my son . I wanted to have a great experience for him and after many reviews on Trip ##ad ##visor I went with the Conrad . It was a great choice . We had a corner suite . Excellent view . My son was very impressed and I have to say that it was the best place I have ever stayed in Chicago . The location is perfect and the service / con ##cier ##ge was all that I could ask for . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Ki ##nz ##ie hotel staff were welcoming and friendly from the beginning to the end of our 4 night stay . The hotel is close to lots of restaurants ( and the Ki ##nz ##ie has lots of deals and coup ##ons for many of them ) . The hotel is also pretty close to the river walk , some hop on bus locations , and Michigan Avenue ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location ! P ##ed ##way access makes it easy to get around the Loop especially during the winter months . Room was clean and bed was comfortable . One draw ##back is the bathroom was small . It would be crowded if you have two people in the room . I also had a spectacular view of the Chicago River ! I would definitely recommend staying at this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is right on the river and close to everything . An easy walk up the Miracle Mile and Navy Pier . The rooms were clean and comfortable . The corner rooms offer great views and are worth the extra cost . Would definitely stay again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This motel was on the boat show website for reduced pricing , free shuttle , discount parking and discount ##s on food , which is why we booked with them , aside from all the things we got at reduced rates this was a fantastic motel , [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Hilton Chicago is a beautiful hotel . It was my home away from home and I enjoyed my stay . There were some awesome employees that made my stay exceptional . Front Des ##k : Matt , Cora , Dana , Medina , & Amanda ; Con ##cier ##ge : Brian ##na & Camille ; Bar : Angel & Carlos ; House ##keeping : Sony ##a , Mary , & Mi ##ldred ; Ban ##quet : At ##tia ; Opera ##tor : Marian ; V ##aca ##tions : Do ##y , Sid ##ona , Larry , & Tony ; Security : Edwin Thank you all so much ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed at the Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal several times and it never di ##sa ##pp ##oint ##s ! High ##ly recommend this hotel . Great staff , awesome access to Lake Shore for walking / running , and the River Walk too . Always excellent customer service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] No complaints . First class hotel . Excellent room . Friendly helpful staff . Good location . Easy walking distance to magnificent mile or waterfront . Free W ##i ##F ##i in lobby and link but not in rooms . Spa ##cious room with excellent walk in wardrobe . Very comfortable beds . [SEP]
1	[CLS] 3rd review of Ki ##nz ##ie . Had to stay in city for work dinner and early meeting the next day . Was able to call and make reservation day of they were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . Such a great location . Room ##s are very modern , love the nice touch of the vintage map on the wall . They really pay attention to detail , one thing when I turn on TV in a hotel room , I ' m always wondering what the channels will be , they have the best handy guide right next to the TV . P ##lent ##y of channels . Small thing but nice . Was able to go to the double cross lounge / bar for one before my dinner . Very nice to be able to get a free drink and some snack ##s . Also in the morning they have nice continental b ##k on each floor . Room was nice and quiet , good sleeping . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel was awesome . A ##wes ##ome enough where I want to go back to Chicago just to stay here . The rooms are large and spacious , and the entire hotel feels very se ##rene . The gym is pretty decent ; although the dumb ##ell ##s only go up to 50 ##l ##bs they have a power rack with a bar ##bell and plates as well as a pull up station with cable weights . Room service was an absolute delight . No checks are given , which means no awkward waiting to sign the bill or feeling o ##b ##liga ##ted to leave a tip after already paying a service fee . Show ##er could have had more pressure but still good . Location is amazing right off Michigan a ##ve . Love the Christmas de ##cor keep it up ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful ##ly situated close to best Chicago attractions and amid spectacular architecture of the city . Terrace by the canal was wonderful rest spot to view Chicago . Staff were welcoming . Con ##cier ##ges were excellent and spot on in recommendations . Though I had better looking and sized rooms for less , he bed and bed ##ding was super comfortable . Very clean ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel offered a unique experience with lovely rooms and ho ##sp ##ita ##ble front desk staff . Would recommend to anyone traveling on business or pleasure . The only challenge was Library Bar was closed for a private event . Instead , went to the P ##ump Room in hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Conrad is a beautiful hotel , brand new , but mid - century modern in design and decoration . The finishes and amenities are luxurious ; and the service is friendly and efficient , from the welcome at the street - level door to the good - bye at the same door , where the young woman who opened the door , hailed a taxi , loaded our bags , and helped me retrieve a $ 10 bill that flew out of my wallet , refused a tip , saying it was all a part of her service . The bathroom is the best I have ever had at a hotel - - spacious , well - organized , and well - light ##ed . Two sinks , a big van ##ity , and a separate water closet make sharing a bathroom with your travel companion easy . The location could hardly be more convenient for shopping , dining , and museums too . The rooftop bar has great views . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I went to Chicago to run the Chicago marathon . It was expensive to stay but , for big events it always is . Usually when we have used O ##m ##ni in the past the welcome was very comforting . That happy , welcome feeling wasn ’ t the experience here . When you are a select member usually it ’ s even better . This hotel just didn ’ t give me the same feeling . The staff didn ’ t feel very welcoming . They seemed quite cold actually which isn ’ t what you want when you spend 1300 + dollars for three days . The hotel was me ##dio ##cre at best . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Beautiful hotel , a bit on the price ##y side , especially the v ##alet parking fee . The hotel is difficult to drive to , v ##alet is convenient but $ 71 is steep . If there is a next time I will risk my life and find other parking or park miles away , for free , and U ##ber or taxi to the hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I really liked the hotel , especially since it ' s located in the heart of Downtown Chicago very close to everything . Great room and rain shower , quick service every time I requested something for my room , nice robe ( although I didn ' t wear it ) and extremely personal staff . My only issue was that you had to pay for w ##if ##i which seems pretty ridiculous . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very good it was great very great very friendly , close to all the cool things in Chicago . I would stay here again if I was coming to Chicago . the staff was very good and help [ f ##ul with all the information needed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for 3 nights in a standard room . The room was on the small side but perfectly fine as we were out and about most of the time . Bed was really com ##fy with nice pillows and hotel was quiet so we had some great sleep there ! Hotel is classic old style looking with some nice original features . Hotel staff were helpful and provided a plug adapt ##er without an issue when we realised we forgot one . Hotel is well positioned for the magnificent mile and walk ##able to navy pier in 20 - 25 minutes . Overall a nice hotel and would recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here with my wife and 8 month son . The hotel provided a pack and play for our son . It is nice to have a separate bedroom from the living room , and it had a very large kitchen . The kitchen includes a half size fridge , sink with disposal , two top burn ##er , microwave and dish ##wash ##er . The breakfast is ok , but nice it was available . One of the best things about this hotel is that there are few rooms on each floor , so it is very quiet . I never heard any of the other guests on our floor . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Generally good , but one significant problem , the room , though clean , was extremely dry . The hotel needs to install some sort of humid ##ifying system . My wife suffered a bloody nose as a result , etc . When this issue was pointed out to the desk staff , the individual stated that the hotel had tried to do something about the problem , but , as yet , had been unsuccessful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed three nights at the Intercontinental . Check in was easy and pleasant . The room , 33rd floor , was well appointed , the bed was comfortable and had a good view ( NBC building ) . Room service was pro ##mpt and t ##idy each day . Stay ##ing in a historic hotel had a good v ##ibe , the pool area was a treat to experience and had a bit of a view to the W ##rig ##ley Building from its stained glass windows . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' ve stayed there many times , and it ' s my favorite place to stay in Chicago ##m for business and for vacation . It ' s just off Michigan Avenue , and very convenient ##ly located . For example , the river boat tours are about 2 blocks away . And the rooms are very comfortable . My daughter has all ##er ##gies , so we reserved an all ##er ##gy - free room for her . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We really struggled when getting into downtown . Our air ##b & b fell through and we were lost . Thanks to Te ##rik it turned our trip around . He suggested some incredible pizza ! Thank you Te ##rik for going above and beyond for us ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoy staying at the Swiss ##ote ##l in Chicago . Love the elevator system - type in the floor you are going to and you are assigned an elevator - makes waiting for the elevators short . The rooms are clean and the location is pretty near Michigan Avenue . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We selected the Hotel Monaco for it ' s ideal location , hotel rate , and the fact it was a pet friendly hotel ( we have a black lab ) . The hotel room was a decent size and we elected to say about $ 20 and for ##go a view , which I will not do again ; I would glad ##ly pay $ 20 more / night for the view that I saw other rooms have even if it ' s a quick glance out at night . There were a few ' green areas ' to walk your dog to relatively close by ( although ours freaked out at the sound of the L - Train ) but never felt uncomfortable with our dog there . Staff was incredible friendly , rooms were clean , and pleased with the cost & value ( although expect to pay close to $ 60 / night for parking ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] The total package was great ! Everything was above expectations . We stayed in P . H 50 years ago , many times and it was still wonderful ! We have many memories of the Palmer House from the Fi ##ft ##ies And Six ##ties [SEP]
0	[CLS] This classic Hilton is convenient ##ly located on Michigan Ave . I had a good experience B ##UT the hotel is a little “ tired . “ I mostly noticed it in the bathroom . The shower had some sort of black growth near the ceiling and the wall ##paper was p ##eel ##ing due to the moisture . For the price they demanded , I would have hoped for a little better . [UNK] [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Location was perfect as it was only 10 min ##s away from the beach and only 15 min ##s from the loop . It was perfectly managed , the rooms were spacious and comfortable , The hotel was close to c ##v ##s , wa ##l ##green ##s and target . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I visit this bar every time I ’ m in Chicago . The staff , drinks & food are always on point . Bart ##ender Kate is really the reason this place has become a staple for my group & our rally spot . Her outstanding service & fun , outgoing attitude are sadly rare these days . Keep it up ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon arrival we were shocked at the check in line . We planned to visit the city for the afternoon before our event planned in the evening , but this was not possible . We wasted just under 1 . 5 hours waiting in line to check in for our room . Check out went smoothly except for waiting approximately 50 minutes for our car with the v ##alet service . So , 3 hours of our one night stay was wasted which is unacceptable for a service business . [SEP]
1	[CLS] It is worth staying here at least once , just to take in the classic hotel architecture and history . The public spaces , such as the lobby and staircase ##s , are absolutely gorgeous . You must look up at the ceiling — almost like the Si ##st ##ine Chapel ! Really stunning . That said , my room was quite small and there was an issue with the sink f ##au ##ce ##t , which the hotel staff fixed quickly , to their credit . I also would have liked a coffee maker in the room . Thankfully , Star ##bu ##cks is on the ground level . It is a beautiful place , but could use some up ##dating . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First ##ly , staff in every area of the hotel are above and beyond what anyone would expect . F ##abulous interactions at every turn . The hotel room itself was spot ##less ! Absolutely clean , comfortable and lots of charm . We upgraded to a street view and would definitely do so again . The restaurant served delicious food , delicious drinks , had a great atmosphere and we never waited for a table . The only " con " during our stay was the extremely slow elevator . We will stay at The Talbot ##t next visit . Perfect ##ion ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I booked my stay through Air B ##n ##B and Brian S made my overall check in experience grand ! He even offered places to eat and drink , thank you Brian for your excellent customer service and overall understanding ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful enjoyed my stay from the beginning to the end . We will definitely stay here again and look for other Conrad Hotels . Room was beautiful and clean . Staff was court ##eous and very helpful at all times . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel was nice . There were restaurants in the hotel and close to the hotel . The location was excellent . We were able to walk around the city and catch a water taxi . On the other hand , we were not impressed with the room . The wall ##paper and carpet were din ##gy and seemed dirty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Palmer house for a convention . I booked a single bed room , just me . They very kindly upgraded me to a bigger room , on the 10th floor . The room was quite nice , although no coffee maker . I personally make myself a cup of hot tea each evening . Anyway , my room was directly across from stairs and next to some sort of maintenance room . The doors close loudly all night ! I know that many hotels have the mechanism that makes doors quiet , that would help . I slept with ear ##p ##lug ##s , but the doors were still bother ##some . On the other hand I loved the fitness center . Big and not too busy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Po ##sitive ##s : - Great location - minutes from Millennium park , the art institute and easy access to trains / buses - Beautiful historic building - the lobby is stunning , and the history of the place is fascinating - Staff were friendly and helpful N ##eg ##ative ##s : - Room was fairly small and looked onto quite a din ##gy inner courtyard ( and this was my ' upgraded ' room as a Hilton diamond member ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] An excellent location . My room was OK with spare furnishings . But , in Oct . 2019 , the hotel was being renovated on the outside . This wouldn ' t have been a problem except that the hotel placed me on a 2nd floor room with s ##ca ##ff ##old ##ing right outside my windows , where workers started at 8 am . When I complained , I was moved to another room on the 13th floor that was quiet . But one of the two elevators was not working for half of my 2 day stay . I had to wait almost 15 minutes for an elevator once and almost every time I had to wait for more than 5 minutes to get into the elevator . The hotel did not offer any discount for these in ##con ##ven ##ience ##s . I would not return to this hotel . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The employees were very friendly . We were lucky to be able to check in to our rooms very early . I was impressed by the clean ##liness of the rooms and by how nice they were for the price ! I would definitely recommend staying here while you ' re in Chicago . Great location ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good location , in the heart of the Loop . Pleasant atmosphere , good service but no power adapt ##er at the reception ( we were recommended to buy one in the corner shop , so the service a bit limited for a hotel claiming to luxury ) . No centralized lighting in the rooms . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Did not love this hotel . V ##ER ##Y busy all of the time . Inc ##ons ##ist ##ent rooms , and long waits at front desk , services , room service . many days room not made up until late in day , long after I left in the a . m . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Monaco for 10 ##night ##s whilst visiting Chicago . The rooms are beautifully furnished , comfortable and spacious . The staff , including the cleaning staff , the reception staff and the door ##men , are so friendly and helpful . And the location , it ' s perfect ! Just across the street is a superb restaurant called The Emerald Loop where you will find delicious food and great staff too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] El ##eva ##tor issues were terrible . Only 1 working entire week we stayed which accounted for around 15 minute wait time to ever get to / leave room ( 14th floor stairs not really an option ) . I found the front desk staff not helpful at all , in fact border ##line rude , however all other staff were fantastic . Very clean and incredibly comfortable bed . Restaurant has fantastic food and service . Overall , nice hotel but very expensive for what we got . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I had registered for this hotel for a business convention at the special convention rate . I was offered an opportunity to upgrade for about $ 25 more per night . We were given room 1911 on a corner of this triangle shaped hotel . The view of the lake , river , Navy Pier and downtown Chicago was stunning . The room was very large and I almost felt I was on a hike every time I wanted to use the rest ##room . Windows , windows windows . The best thing about this hotel was the food . We had several opportunities for app ##eti ##zers and meals within the hotel . The food was very good . Much better than many other hotels I have stayed in the Chicago core . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you are looking for good value than Home ##wood is it . The rooms are well - renovated and clean and spacious . It was very comfortable . Also , the location is great ! However , be warned : this is not the hotel if you want f ##rill ##s . Specifically , there is no room service . Also , I was a little annoyed when the cleaning service knocked on my door at 8 ##am both mornings , waking me up as a result . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We often stay here when visiting Chicago - good location , great views and spacious room with excellent service . Did not visit the restaurant on this trip , but the Palm is an excellent choice for dinner as well , and the lobby bar is comfortable and good for relaxing and / or people watching . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Five or ten years ago the Swiss ##ote ##l Chicago was far better than it is today . We ' ve stayed here for decades , sorry to see what ' s happened to it . Everything digit ##ized , robotic ; rare to see any staff , and then they are imp ##erson ##al and cold . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Such a beat ##it ##ful hotel . . . . the pool was un ##real . Wonderful staff . Thanks to Will on the front door helping us with our luggage ( lots of luggage ) and finding us a ride to the airport . . . . much appreciated . Great location ! ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I took my two daughters for a very last minute weekend trip and found a great deal . The location was perfect and everyone we dealt with was very friendly and helpful . I would definitely recommend this hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The rooms are nothing special but this is a great conference venue with pleasant and efficient staff ##ing . Good on ##site food options and easy logistics . Reason ##able airport ride share prices as long as it isn ’ t during rush hour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you have a chance to visit the 33rd floor lounge , it is worth it . The views are absolutely amazing ! They offer a continental breakfast and happy good and wine . We ’ ve been visiting the lounge for 12 years and they have always had the same server . The server ’ s name is Connie and she is always so persona ##ble . It feels like family and we are home in Los Angeles but in Chicago . Love the lounge ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Bath ##room sink had w ##his ##kers in and around it . Otherwise the room was OK . The v ##ibe is kinda s ##wan ##ky . The central location is good for walking to tourist sites , such as Navy Pier , Ohio Street Beach , the Bean , and Buckingham Fountain . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Talbot ##t was perfect for our granddaughter ’ s Bat Mi ##tz ##va ##h weekend . We had a great deal of out of town family and it was such fun to be together in an intimate space . It was comfortable for our family and priced well . The restaurant is very good and a great place to get together . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great small hotel with great history . The staff was so nice . Room ##s were so comfortable and clean . Not to mention the small bar was outstanding . Had the best ma ##rt ##ini ##s ever there ! And great great location ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] I just love the Conrad Chicago ! The rooms are beautiful , the service is ex ##em ##p ##lary , and the location can ' t be beaten . I come to Chicago off and on business , and the Conrad Chicago will definitely be my hotel ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We held our annual meeting at the H ##ya ##tt Regency Chicago and every meal we had there was excellent . We also found the hotel staff very at ##ten ##tive . Our members and staff were very pleased . The larger meeting / session rooms were sometimes over air - conditioned , but that happens everywhere these days . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My sisters and I spent two nights at the Talbot ##t this past weekend and we couldn ' t have been happier . From the moment we arrived , we were treated like royalty . The room was enormous , the beds were really comfortable , and every single staff member was amazing . R ##oan ##a , the con ##cier ##ge , made our stay extra special . The hotel restaurant / bar , 20 ##e , provided the perfect spot to meet with other family members to raise a toast to our sister . Our server Julia took great care of us and the food was great . Thank you for a 5 - star weekend . We will definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location , clean hotel . There are two towers with lots of rooms . The rooms are quiet , Very little noise coming from outside . There is an excellent gym and you can return your rental car ( Her ##tz ) at the hotel ( although with limited hours ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Three guys all just turned 60 wanted to enjoy Buddy Guys , Good food and drink , some art , seeing a friend , and some fresh air . We got to be tourists and get away from the office . The spa and the roof top deck put the trip to the top of the list . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff was great to us ( wife and two boys ) Nicole and Mel went above and beyond to make things special since my wife ’ s birthday fell on one of the days we were here . We had a an excellent view of the river and the location is great . Away from the h ##ust ##le and bust ##le but we used U ##ber most of the time and prices were low . If weather wasn ’ t hot we would have walked . The rooms were spacious and our party of four was comfortable in the two bed setup . Also a small mini fridge in the room so we bought some waters at a C ##VS that was only a block away . This hotel is close to Navy Pier so plenty views on it and the lake too . Great experience and k ##udo ##s to the staff and management ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We make a yearly pre - Christmas trip every year . We love the holiday decorations and love that so many great restaurants , shopping and destinations are within walking distance ! ! Close to the South Shore train station . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Super ##b hotel . Great price for location . F ##law ##less . Have stayed here numerous times over the years on business and pleasure , and it is always excellent . High ##ly recommended . The suites are great , and the food is extremely good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed for 1 night . Central location near all the shops . Chicago is lovely and clean city . Co ##m ##fy bed . Staff friendly . W ##i if worked fine . Room service arrived quickly . Would recommend going on the boat trip lets you see good views of all the tall buildings and good value took the 75 minute trip . Thanks [SEP]
1	[CLS] Perfect position near Michigan avenue , the hotel is comfortable and pleasant . We had a very nice junior suite , large and well equipped . Good restaurant and professional service . Not cheap , but the price is well relative with the quality of the service . High ##ly recommended . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The two day training conference was excellent but it pale ##d in comparison to the two Cubs games that we were able to attend . W ##rig ##ley Field is by far the most no ##stal ##gic baseball stadium I have ever attended . [SEP]
1	[CLS] A ##wes ##ome location . Very polite and professional staff . Very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting - we brought back left ##overs from dinner and did not realize there was not a refrigerator . I called the front desk and a refrigerator was delivered in ten minutes . I would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff in the Gold lounge are so at ##ten ##tive and helpful . I usually travel for short periods to the US so having people that understand your needs really quickly helps . Good location for both business and leisure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Upon arrival was greeted very nicely . The front desk staff was really friendly and customer service focused . I opted for an " upgraded " room . Much to my surprised my upgrade got me a view right into the guest rooms across the way from my room . The AC wasn ' t up to par either . Set ##ting it at 65 , the room was lucky to get to 72 . I did not realize this until getting back to the room late so didn ' t feel like staying up for someone to come fix it , I would just expect that for the price paid everything would be in working order . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was our first time to Chicago ##n and I couldn ' t have had a better time . The staff at Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile were great . The room was very clean and it was located perfectly on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I only stayed one night at this hotel on business but really enjoyed the stay . The room was comfortable and clean , shower and bathroom fine , good internet service and a breakfast served on every floor in the central hallway near the elevators . And the breakfast wasn ' t an elegant b ##uff ##et but was much better than the usual found in this type of am ##eric ##an hotel . The hotel is much smaller than a Hilton or H ##ya ##tt . it felt good ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Inter ##C ##ont ##inen ##tal Chicago is one of the most comfortable , room ##y , service - oriented hotels anywhere . Built as a clubhouse for the Shrine ##rs in the 1920s , it features a 75 - foot pool in a magnificent setting on its 10th floor . The amenities , from the spa , to the meeting rooms , to the bar are all first - rate . They don ' t build hotels like this anymore . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location allowed us to walk everywhere , including a night ##time s ##tro ##ll on the River Walk . Good breakfast in the restaurant next door . Room was in good condition but very under ##state ##d . Staff was exceptionally friendly and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . They allowed us to check out a little beyond noon , which was helpful . I feared noise as sire ##ns are frequent on W ##aba ##sh for some reason ( and it was Lo ##lla weekend ) , but our room ( 10th floor ) was pretty quiet . I slept very well on very comfortable beds . Would have liked free w ##if ##i . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Staff very helpful and pleasant . Lo ##bby area co ##zy and well done . Room de ##cor big let ##down from expectations after experiencing lobby . 60 ’ s feeling de ##cor that seemed tired , couldn ’ t stop looking at the u ##gli ##est floor lamp and bizarre framed art im ##agi ##na ##ble . Bath and beds good but bath lacked grab bar which seemed dangerous especially for older guests . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Restaurant staff very un ##friend ##ly . They leave before you have time to complete your order . Once you are served , they never come by again . They seem to be pissed all the time . You are obviously a n ##ui ##sance to them . Smile is not even an option . I ’ ve never seen such a bad service in the US . Rafael is specially nasty . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at this class ##y hotel . The hallway ##s and room were quiet and the room itself was lovely . Large bathroom with all amenities including large shower and separate tub . We did ask for a room on a higher floor but unfortunately they were unable to accommodate the request . The only negative we found was that the a / c in our room didn ' t appear to be functioning but we didn ' t notice it until late in the evening so didn ' t let the Front Des ##k know until the following morning , and we stayed only one night . The location is perfect for walking around and the area felt very safe . I would highly recommend this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful hotel , easy friendly check - in , beautiful room , great location ! Star ##bu ##cks near - by , Stan ’ s Don ##uts not - to - far away , parking garage next door that leads into a small grocery store which is very convenient . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Swiss ##ote ##l for a business trip last week ( April 2019 ) . I lost an important note ##boo ##ok , but knew it was somewhere on the hotel property . The head of security immediately started a search for the notebook and found it within half an hour . I was very app ##re ##cia ##tive ! He did a great job ( forgot his name otherwise I ' d mention it here ) . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel was nice , front desk staff very pleasant . room was comfortable if a bit dated . the “ old tower ” architecture is wonderful on the second and third floors ! Love ##d having a Star ##bu ##cks on the lower level [UNK] drinks and snack ##s at M ##J ’ s would skip that , very over ##p ##rice ##d Would stay again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We recently visited Chicago and stayed at the Conrad Hilton Hotel . It is a fresh and handsome facility with extraordinary service . The location of the hotel between Rush and Michigan was perfect . We will stay at the Conrad again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a classic old hotel located in the heart of downtown Chicago near the Art Institute and State Street . We were given an old , tiny room in an old wing that was basically filled by the king bed . The room offered no coffee maker , no breakfast b ##uff ##et , no bottle ##d water , no refrigerator , and one of those over ##p ##rice ##d mini bars with a sensor that charges you if you even ji ##ggle it . And the pool was being serviced . I assume there are better rooms than this . The lobby of the hotel is a lively place , and lots of groups and conventions come here . But I see better amenities at a Holiday Inn . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Everything appeared and turned , the evening events , the staff was helpful , business area allows you to do some work , parking is expensive and terrible , Yu ' r right on Michigan Ave , not far from anything , overlooking Grant Park [SEP]
1	[CLS] First — watch your credit card statement because it appears this hotel is owned by a company in the UK . Our credit card was charged an exchange fee . Hotel staff told me to call my credit card company . Credit card company told me to talk to the hotel . Nobody seems to be able to help in either place . Must be my error somewhere — I guess . Room was rather expensive for its size , but it is downtown Chicago . A block or two of a walk will get you to the 360 Chicago experience AK ##A John Hancock building . Lots of shopping nearby for higher end products . Fun to look at anyway . [SEP]
0	[CLS] It was one of the best hotel we have ever been . So clean , good view , nice and polite staff . It has the most quite and comfortable bed . Very very quiet room . Nice breakfast that you would love it . We really enjoyed our time there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our stay was excellent ! The staff was very friendly and the location was in the middle of everywhere we were going . Would highly recommend this hotel ! Had to park on the next block though if you don ' t use the v ##alet service . Still not that far though . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed for only one night but I could have stayed longer . Hotel rooms were spacious , clean , quiet , comfortable and updated . Bath ##room was very modern . The front desk staff was very helpful . Restaurant was great and lobby very comfortable . The location was great for us . We walked everywhere . We will definitely stay here again next time in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay at the Palmer House . It ' s a very busy hotel due to its historic beauty and convenient location . Our room was comfortable and clean . The shower offered great water pressure and basic toilet ##ries that are standard . The room was not elaborate by any means . The mini - bar and snack ##s were fully stock ##ed . We didn ' t see a price sheet for anything so that went untouched ! Even though I could hear people in the hall , our room was quiet at night . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here during a busy conference week . Excellent , clean rooms . Very quiet on the 30th floor . Very comfortable bed . Staff were very helpful in attain ##ing transport . Quick check in and check out . Located close to all the action in Chicago ' s Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Located on the ma ##g mile , an older , but quality hotel . When you enter you need to go to the third floor to check in , but then you feel you are inside a nice hotel . The suite , which we used has a separate couch area and very comfortable beds in the bedroom area . The lighting could definitely be brighter . The pool is a very wonderful temperature ( which some hotels are not always that way , so good job O ##m ##ni ! ) and there is a hot tub too ! We had breakfast in restaurant and bar 67 ##6 located on the fourth floor of the hotel , overlooking the Michigan Avenue ! It ’ s a great space for a meal or a drink ! Other than the room being small and a bit dark , everything was good and location is great ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The view was nice . The room was clean . The service was good . The staff was nice and helpful . Lots of great restaurants close by and within walking distance . Lots of great stores to go shopping too . En ##joy ##ed my stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The Palmer House is a great old hotel with nice smaller rooms , heavy classic furniture . Clean rooms , small bathroom ##s . Very comfortable beds with nice linen ##s . A spectacular lobby and bar area with ceiling murals and b ##al ##con ##ies . Great at ##ten ##tive service . Perfect location , one block off Michigan Avenue by Millennium Park . Worth a stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I am a Platinum member and visited the Con ##cier ##ge Lounge at the She ##rato ##n Grand every evening during my stay . Connie Alex in the club lounge , who was there for my 1st 3 evenings was wonderful . Her hospitality is un ##mat ##ched not only to me but to all of those in the lounge . She pro ##active ##ly asked what she could get me and continued to check with me throughout my time in the lounge . Thank you Connie ! Keep it up ! You are rare ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel was AM ##A ##Z ##ING . The rooftop pool was fantastic and the staff could not have been more F ##RI ##EN ##D ##L ##Y ! I would recommend this to anyone . I found it on a blog . The size of the suite was fantastic , especially for being right in the heart of Chicago . The internet s ##tan ##k , as usual with hotels . That is really the only bad thing I have to say . The room had a microwave and a dish ##wash ##er ! Maybe I missed the me ##mo on extended stay suites , but that is THE way to go when traveling with a family . Great experience ! The staff had it TO ##GE ##TH ##ER ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve been coming to this hotel for 30 years to a yearly convention and I just love it . Con ##ven ##ient to the south shore line at millennium station , shopping and rest ##ura ##nts at the foot of Michigan Avenue . The building itself is absolutely beautiful . Built as a Masonic temple in 1929 the detail is amazing . It ’ s worth just wondering th ##ru the building taking your time to appreciate the details of the ceilings and architecture . The staff is friendly and helpful . Star ##bu ##cks and Michael Jordan ’ s on site . Food is excellent . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Good stuff : location ; splendid d ##é ##cor / architecture ; friendly / helpful staff Bad stuff : very expensive parking ; charge for w ##if ##i in room ; restaurant ( staff advised to breakfast elsewhere ! ) ; some rooms / corridors very must ##y & sick ##ly sweet smelling - we had to change rooms ( & floors ) on arrival ; room very warm - could not get it cooler ; room average / ordinary for price paid T ##ip ##s : eat breakfast at Te ##mpo - 2 blocks W , 2 blocks S from hotel ; parking across the road from hotel about half hotel ' s price [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed 8 nights in this hotel . Room ##s were clean and spacious , the bed was very comfortable . The evening Manager ##s reception , food and drinks menu was good . Different hot food every evening . Breakfast ##s wears good too . The location of this hotel is exceptional . Direct ##ly in line with Navy Pier , 20 ##min walk away . Also a short walk away is Millennium Park and the Bean , the Loop , shops on the Millennium Mile , North Shore 20 ##min walk . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very pleasant staff . Great deal out of season ! Free c ##rois ##san ##ts & coffee to go in the lobby . Excellent . Reno ##vated rooms are very comfortable and well done . Excellent location , but not subject to excessive noise or traffic . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I enjoyed my stay at this property ! The hotel was located downtown a ##bs was close to shopping and restaurants . The H ##ya ##tt was very beautiful and the service and friend ##liness of the hotel staff was excellent ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is among the p ##ric ##y ones , but you do get a lot in return - so we can highly recommend the place ! On the positive side : - location could not be better , two blocks away from the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile and a 5 min s ##tro ##ll from the metro station Chicago - very friendly staff - good breakfast - com ##fy and clean rooms with a very „ new “ feel to it ( not even scratch ##es on the walls ) Po ##ten ##tial for improvement : - the gym could use a re ##furbishment and does not have any daylight - during our stay , only two out of four elevators were operating , leaving guests with quite some waiting times when trying to go up or down We would definitely come back ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The hotel is over ##rated , the service was terrible but the w ##ost part was the clean ##liness of the room , the last day at 6 in the afternoon the room was not cleaned , so we went to the front desk and asked them to send someone to make the room . We came back at 10 : 00 ##pm , and the room was not cleaned . The excuse of the front desk was that because of a s ##ti ##ke the employees were having , they had no person ##ell to make rooms . We found dirty sheets , dirty rug , and a very bad temper in the front desk . The hit ##el is well located , but that is about it ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have been here a few times for business but on my last visit found out they no longer allow pre order of coffee the night before . They offer to bring up a coffee maker to the room but after 1 h ##r of waiting I chose to go to sleep . I like the hotel but not very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting for a quick business trip [SEP]
1	[CLS] The old Ambassador Hotel has been renovated and re ##born as the Public . I appreciated the spacious room - - we needed two beds , but in our price range ( under $ 200 / night ) most of the downtown hotels offered only rooms with one double or queen during this period . The Gold Coast neighborhood is lovely for walking around and the Rush Street restaurants are nearby . My only negative reactions were a ) no coffee ##maker in the room , and b ) it took much longer than the promised 10 minutes to retrieve our car from v ##alet parking . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a very nice hotel , located in the heart of some amazing shopping ( ups ##cale ) also located near great sights i . e . Navy Pier , Water Tower , museums , movie theaters etc . . . Hotel has decent am ##ent ##ies too , this hotel is worth the price [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed here for business . Great hotel - - loved the staff who handled requests and a delivery really well for me . Like ##d the gym and the rooms were very comfortable . I had a fair bit of work to do and the in - room office was excellent . I ' d stay there again . It ' s got a lot of character . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel went from 4 to 5 star based on Kathy , the Con ##cier ##ge . Kathy added value to our visit with insights not online and her knowledge / connections with restaurants and hot ##sp ##ots . S ##O efficient , AL ##WA ##Y ##S pleasant - saved us time we didn ' t have to search . Can ' t get this value in apartment stay or other hotels . I ' ll be back because of Kathy . Our 3rd visit in a year , as a couple and with kids . Room ##s gorgeous , lobby beautiful . All so clean . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel is beautiful with stunning views of the city located by all the shopping . The staff was beyond amazing ! We had a couple of things broken in the room ( toilet seat and light ) that were fixed right away . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I reviewed this hotel a year ago after a work conference . The stay last year and recently were great as far as the hotel itself . However , last year the v ##alet parking process was horrible . This year the process was great . Last year we waited 90 minutes for our car - this year 5 minutes . How did the process change ? Some of the customers were given green v ##alet parking slips and others were given yellow . The green slips were for pick up at the main entrance and the yellow for downstairs at the v ##alet parking counter . What a difference it made . Thank you to the She ##rato ##n for being re ##sp ##ons ##ive to the complaints from last year . As always , the hotel staff was great . Check in was a breeze . The room was spectacular . We had a great view of the Chicago River . [SEP]

1	[CLS] The two ladies in the Sales Department - Sara and Jacqueline - were O ##UT ##ST ##AN ##DI ##NG ! They are both re ##sp ##ons ##ive , helpful and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting to the many changes to our group reservation . I cannot say enough nice things about working with the two of them . Also , the entire Vale ##t Department - especially Am ##er - is top notch . I needed a box delivered to my room - then later , picked up . The guy who picked up was friendly and very pro ##mpt . It was also a delight to have " Michael " ( ? ) at the front desk to greet me every morning - as well as help with distribution of bags to my other team members to pick up when they checked in . We will DE ##FI ##NI ##TE ##L ##Y stay here again - and I would also personally stay there again for a leisure trip . The location and hotel are better than any in that area ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Hotel Monaco Chicago location is extremely convenient as it is in the center of downtown with incredible views . Walking distance from wonderful restaurants and shops . The decoration of the hotel is modern and yet has a old world charm to it . Extreme high ceilings , beautiful curtains and carpet ##s combine old charm with current trends . The restaurant in the lobby is wonderful with great choices . The hotel also had a happy hour with free wine that gathered guests and friends . The staff was extremely a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and warm . I will definitely be coming back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We recently stayed with our 6 month old daughter and would highly recommend this hotel ! We had a spacious room , enjoyed the full kitchen and compliment ##ary breakfast ! Love ##d that we could get our own snack ##s , and alcohol and keep it in our room . The breakfast had plenty of options and the warm dishes varied day to day . The pool was nice and warm and never really busy . All of the staff we encountered were so helpful and friendly ! The only down ##side was that the elevators could be slow at busy times . Also we request a pack ' n ' play for our daughter to sleep in , but was told on the phone that it wouldn ' t be guaranteed . We brought our own and used it as there wasn ' t any available ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a corner room which was nice although a little small and dated . The shower was huge but unfortunately it leaked . The hotel has 3 elevators but only 2 were working and on our last day it was down to just 1 . The staff was friendly and helpful and we really liked the location but the $ 10 . 95 per day for W ##i ##F ##i was too much . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I hadn ##t been to Chicago for a few years and I decided to stay here . I loved the hotel which was very spacious . Very old school g ##aw ##dy or like Beverly Hills type rich . In the heart of downtown Chicago and somewhat spend ##y . . But great staff and deposit was fine . . no problems with money or anything else . Very easy [SEP]
1	[CLS] It ’ s such a convenient location with a fairly reasonable price for this grand historic hotel . We always stay here . Two minute walk to the train , ten or fifteen minute walk to many major sites . We were here to see Hamilton and you could see the theater from the hotel . I wish someone would have mentioned that it was part of that architecture tour that was going on when we were there . It was very very busy this weekend and it showed . [SEP]

I will visit every year just for his song : ) [SEP]
1	[CLS] Since your arrival , everybody makes you feel welcome / special ! Man ##dan ##a , V ##í ##ctor , H ##yon , and Je ##s ##ús were all extra helpful . . . they made a difference in our stay . The hotel room and location were excellent too . Having a N ##es ##press ##o machine in the room . . . w ##ow ! We also liked the view toward Mill ##eni ##um Park . [SEP]
0	[CLS] My husband and I took our to ##ddler and our teenage brother to stay here for one night . Internet service and all other free amenities were great . We will be d ##ta ##ying here each time we visit Chicago . The hot breakfast items could be a bit more selective but overall it was good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Wonderful Hotel ! Great location , right on Michigan avenue ! The staff was very friendly and made sure all your needs were met . The in house restaurant was very good , wonderful food and great service . I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is pretty luxurious . It ’ s located right off Michigan Avenue so location is a plus . We had a king room and had a city view . The high ceilings in the room set the tone . The bathroom was supreme as it has a separate toilet and large walk in shower with double sinks . The linen ##s were great and the room was very clean . They also provided free bottle ##d water . We will definitely stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We ’ ve just returned from a brilliant stay at Home ##wood Suite ##s in Chicago . The staff couldn ’ t have been more helpful and the atmosphere is one of the best I ’ ve experienced . The hotel itself is perfect for a city break , with a pool on the 19th floor with great views of the city . The rooms are so spacious and clean . The breakfast was better than we expected and made for a great start to the day . It ’ s just off Michigan Avenue so it ’ s ideal ##ly located for a c ##irt visit . We will definitely be back . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Was happy to get such great , personal attention from Sharon , Mu ##gi and Man ##dan ##a . Chicago Gold team is absolute top drawer in remembering your name , preferences and offering help . Perfect , quiet location to recover between sessions at the IT ##W conference next door . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean - at ##ten ##tive & friendly staff - central ##ly located within walking distance of great restaurants . . . subway . . . albeit a bit on the price ##y side . A personal experience to relate - I returned to my car ( self parked in the garage their v ##alet parking uses ) and got out on the wrong floor . I must have looked like a deer in the headlights since one of the hotel v ##alet ##s saw me and said , " I know where your car is parked . . . I saw you park earlier . C ##lim ##b in and I ' ll take you to your car . " Wow ! ! ! His name is Anna ##sta ##fe ##e ( s ##p ) , originally from E ##rit ##rea and despite his service and at ##ten ##tive ##ness was outstanding . . . other staff employees embraced the same attitude and customer at ##ten ##tive ##ness . We will return ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at the Talbot ##t Hotel for a work function the week of June 10th for 3 nights . On the first night I was entering the hotel with a very full glass of milk ( yes , you have milk when you visit S ##p ##rin ##kles cup ##cake ) . I hit the side of the elevator with my arm and dumped a complete glass of milk onto the elevator floor . I felt terrible for the accident and immediately tried to clean it up . Taylor appeared out of no where and took over , not allowing me to help . He was so friendly and helpful and never once made me feel bad for accident . He then proceeded to get another glass of milk and find me so that I didn ' t have to eat my cup ##cake without milk . What customer service ! The hotel was super clean , nice , etc . Custom ##er Service was outstanding ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Where do I begin ? We stayed in the Chicago hotel this week , checking in on Sunday and leaving late Thursday ( July 2 ) . This was by far THE B ##ES ##T stay in a hotel that we have in a long time . The room was wonderful , but the staff - - the staff ! They were the best ! Two of our favorites were Jonathan , working in the lobby and Antonio , who should be the door ##man of the year ! The caring attitude and the attention to detail were un ##believable . Antonio called us by name every time he saw us and , when I made a request of him , knew our room number without asking . But the kicker was that , on my husband ' s birthday Thursday , he brought us cup ##cakes ! We had never stayed with Monaco or Kim ##pton , but we certainly will seek you out in the future . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying at this hotel and it will also be the last . My issue isn ’ t so much with the property itself , more with a lack of understanding of what I signed up for . I paid $ 200 for their Ambassador Program and truth ##fully , that ’ s $ 200 wasted ! The check in staff did not seem to care whether I had this or not , and some of the details of the program they weren ’ t too sure if either . Room was NO ##T ready when it said it would be either . The hotel is situated right on the Ma ##g Mile and the room was nice and quiet . Good to try this I guess , but will never go back , we have stayed at hotels that cost less , we ’ re just as nice , but more importantly , made us feel welcome . This hotel missed the mark on that . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a fantastic stay at this hotel . Book ##ed Fair ##mont Gold with access to the lounge . Love ##ly selection of snack ##s and drinks . Staff all very friendly and helpful . The room itself was spacious and clean . Yes some of the furniture is a little tired and could do with an update but overall very nice hotel . Great location too . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was my second stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie ( stayed before when it was called the Am ##al ##fi ) . Love ##ly rooms with : good w ##if ##i , refrigerator , robes , umbrella ##s , nice bath products , lots of towels , and super comfortable beds . Lots of choices at breakfast and the evening cocktail reception , which are fantastic amenities . The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful , and the location is ideal for visiting all of Chicago ' s attractions . I am already looking forward to my next stay . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Great times with my family , we enjoyed our stay at the So ##fit ##el , ideal ##ly located on the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! The staff is very helpful and always anti ##ci ##pating our needs . I will definitely come back very soon ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Fantastic location . The room was comfortable . The staff were fantastic , I was un ##well on my trip but Amir on the front desk was very quick , kind and helpful . I received great service . Thank you for your service [SEP]
1	[CLS] We requested a mini fridge and it was ready to go when we arrived Room was pre ##p quickly and always done when we came back from morning or afternoon events The hotel is situated in an ideal location close to everything [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location , close to the magnificent mile Great staff and super friendly , they go the extra mile to make feel at home and special . Great room ; very spacious . I can not recommend this beautiful hotel more . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great location . Spa ##cious , modern room . We got upgraded to a river view , which also included a lake view . It is a bit price ##y but you get what you pay for . We would stay here again . We did have drinks in the lobby bar and they are very price ##y . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Not in the " miracle mile " but close . Was perfect for walking to McCormick Place for tournament . 2 miles is a nice walk during the day . Not to be missed is the pizza and the don ##uts ( even g ##lut ##en free ) The bell hop recommendation were spot on ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel , with a good service for a good price . Well located - close to the Loop and to the lake . Clean , nice room with nice view and comfortable bed . Great breakfast ##s . O ##b ##li ##ging staff . I choose this hotel every time I come to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel staff is nice & know what they do . The location is perfect . Room ##s are clean and really really big . The red line is a few steps away so you can go anywhere you want quickly . Only problem we had : There is no taxi line , hotel staff goes out and tries to pick up a taxi from the street . I have waited 25 minutes and was too late to a business meeting . Other than that , everything was fine . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel for the location . Custom ##er service while checking in and out was not welcoming or warm . Bell ##men were excellent and always smiling . My room was nice but not what I expected . The windows dripped with con ##den ##sation , the base ##boards , walls , and window screen were not in the best condition . I never received the per ##ks being a rewards member . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Just 2 blocks from the water tower , the Hancock Tower and the Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile . The hotel is beautifully appointed . The bed was very com ##fy , with nice linen ##s . bathroom has separate tub from shower enclosure . Nice view of part of the city . I really like the color scheme and design sense . Modern , yet warm and intimate . [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel has an old style charm to it . Large , ornate and a touch of so ##phi ##stic ##ation . The price is nice , and the location is excellent . My only downfall is that in typical Hilton style , not everyone you deal with has the same level of expertise and training that is what used to be Hilton . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Photo ##s of this place are misleading . It isn ' t as big or impressive . However , included breakfast was a plus and the location is PR ##IM ##E . Clean bathroom ##s and kitchen ##s . The beds are very comfortable , but we found lots of hairs on our pillows and blankets . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved this hotel the beds were super com ##fy . There were beautiful linen ##s ( lots of feather pillows , a down comfort ##er , super soft sheets ) , great service , clean , lots of nice restaurants , good location . Staff were also wonderful , very friendly and helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We were greeted upon arrival from our U ##ber , escorted to the front door and directed to the front desk . As soon as we reached the front desk we were assisted by a very a ##cco ##mi ##dating employee when asked to put me in a quite room , took my request serious and actually upgraded me with a view of the water at no extra charge . He made sure there was not an attached room with door or ice machine on this level . I ' m a very light sleep ##er and appreciate when someone goes out of their way to make my stay away from home comfortable . Thank you Ke ##enan ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] Every im ##agi ##na ##ble detail for comfort has been anticipated and taken care of . From the remote controlled lights , blind ##s , temperature . . . every creature comfort is completely thought out . You cannot find a cleaner , comfortable and luxurious hotel this side of Vegas . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My family stayed here 4 nights . We stayed on the 15th floor , which gave us access to special services . Every staff person seemed to be genuinely interested in us having a wonderful stay . We were able to check into our rooms mid - morning . Any house ##keeping request was addressed immediately . The food and service in the floor ’ s lounge was excellent . Our rooms were clean , comfortable , and s ##ty ##lish . The hotel sent us champagne and chocolate covered straw ##berries as an Anniversary surprise ! The location is f ##abulous - we saw the Sunday night fireworks from our room . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved the comfort of the beds , but would have preferred a top sheet . We could have used a handle on the inside of the shower . It was the clean ##est hotel I ' ve ever been in . We did find several of the plug ##s did not work and the iron needed to have a longer cord to reach the end of the iron board . The employees were very friendly and the guys outside were fun to tease . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We arrived the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker after a larger event had wrapped up causing some issues in the street in front . Let ' s be honest - this is Chicago - if you think you ' re going to park easily I have some beach ##front property in Arizona that might interest you . Kay ##lin at the front desk was a true professional . Had us checked in with great recommendations and the room was top shelf . Would recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago for location - service - and history . Kay ##lin was a great ambassador for the brand and was the turning point for our arrival . Thanks a ton ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ’ ve stayed at Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro couple of times during my business trip to Chicago , I strongly recommend . The hotel kept the old architectural style , very clean and located close to theaters and restaurants , with a Star ##bu ##cks next to the hotel . They don ’ t provide free internet [SEP]
0	[CLS] This was a very elegant hotel . They don ' t provide A microwave or refrigerator in the room I ' m sure to force you eat in their expensive restaurants . I just ordered ji ##mmy Johns when I was there because they deliver . Other than that it was a wonderful hotel and a comfortable stay ! ! I recommend it to anyone staying downtown . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The check in with Carlos was fast , efficient and Inc ##red ##ibly friendly . He also upgraded our room without asking and all his recommendations for restaurants were spot on . The room was well - appointed and very clean . The whole experience was topped off by free champagne and app ##eti ##zers in the lobby . We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] one of the best hotel experience we have tried during our trip in USA . we stay in 5 hotels , this is simply the best ##s without doubts . large room and spot ##lessly clean . the hotel staff allows us an early check - in . this is quite rare for the quality chain hotel we have experience in the past . although we don ' t use the lobby and the meeting facilities . but this is truly a world class venue . highly recommend . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our here this 4 ##rth of July . The Location was perfect and there was no fireworks going crazy all night long . . We walked to restaurants , and the lake was very near by . The staff was awesome . Luis and Sc ##att were very helpful ! ! Looking forward staying here again . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] They did an amazing job ! Wedding receptions in downtown Chicago are not cheap . . . the tax & tip ( an additional 33 % ) don ' t help but the hotel couldn ' t have done more to make our daughter ' s day special and the art de ##co de ##cor was a big hit with all our guests . The reception was for 134 people and I would recommend paying the add ##ito ##nal $ 300 for the Sa ##v ##voy room for the cocktail hour . . . guests couldn ' t stop talking about it ! The hotel was red ##one a few years ago and is bursting with character and personality . The rooms will probably seem small to most people but it is because the hotel is historic and you can only move so many walls . They do have suites that are bigger . Don ' t miss happy hour in the lobby ( I think this might be a Friday only thing ) . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We used Kim ##pton Hotel All ##egro for our wedding weekend and it was the best decision we made ! The hotel staff was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and was there every step of the way . We had last minute changes and Shannon O ' Neill was always there to make sure everything went smooth and answered very promptly . All of our family and friends compliment ##ed the beautiful hotel de ##cor and were very satisfied with their rooms . Vale ##t parking was very easy and check out and check in was very smooth . Overall we had a great experience and will definitely be staying again and recommend ##ing it to anyone getting married in Chicago ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very nice hotel . Walking distance for all principal tourist ##ic attractions . All the personal are very kind and helpful . The bedroom is clean and with good size . The bedroom is full equipped . Nice experience in this hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came way before check in and they were very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting ! Stella ##r customer service from the moment we walked in the door . Room was very nice and clean . We had dinner in the Restaurant it was excellent . Really can not express the customer service at this Hotel ! I will definitely come and stay there again ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is a g ##em ! We were so lucky to find it on our first trip to Chicago , 6 months ago . We recently got married and I surprised my new husband with a trip to Chicago for a mini - honeymoon . We stayed at the K ##nick ##er ##bo ##cker once again , and were once again impressed ! Upon check in , Karen , asked what we were in town for . Once we told her we got married the week prior , she im ##mi ##date ##ly upgraded out room to a suite for the entire stay . Henry , the con ##cier ##ge , gave us a couple of free drinks for the hotel bar . Our en ##it ##re stay was nothing but delight ##ful . I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to Chicago . It ' s a great location , great staff , and reasonable price . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Would not stay here again . Staff was very me ##dio ##cre and no early or even mid day check ##ins . Noise was awful as there was a ch ##ica ##go hotel strike going on and right below my window , starting at 5 am . very little attention to needs . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at The Talbot ##t for 3 nights from 05 May 2019 to 08 May 2019 . Very well located . Close to all attractions . Nice , clean and peaceful up ##market locality . We stayed in a del ##uxe king room . . . We had two rooms . One was very big , the other a bit smaller . But both well appointed . Good house ##keeping . The best part was the service . Excellent con ##cier ##ge . . . Tim . . thanks a lot . Only issue was they do not provide tea or coffee maker in the rooms . Though they have a good compliment ##ary tea coffee service in the lobby in the mornings . All in all a very good experience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The main selling point of this hotel is its location near Grant park and close to down town Chicago . From a comfort perspective the room was below average which was disappointing for a 4 star hotel . Our room was dark and cold ( in spite of adjusting air con ) and there were no spare blankets provided . No k ##ett ##le , no milk for a limited tea choice and for a country in which everything is big the double beds were small . The breakfast was also pretty limited . While the location is good I would recommend checking out alternative locations . [SEP]
0	[CLS] We were stopping over in Chicago before heading off on the next leg of our trip on our anniversary . Ali ##na did everything to make our stay here absolutely perfect , even sending up some very nice treats to make the evening even more special . I will absolutely be staying here for my next trip to Chicago - - the best place I have stayed in the city ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We came in to see a show at the Ruth Page theatre . I picked the Talbot because of the online pictures , location , and price . We had a fantastic weekend stay there . Besides the staff being so nice and friendly , it is a beautiful building , the room was very comfortable with a great bed . We both woke up and almost at the same time said how great we slept . Go there , you ' ll be happy ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location was perfect for our wedding reception at the Mid America Club in the A ##on Center . The views in some of the rooms is incredible . The service at the Fair ##mont went above and beyond what was expected . They set up our br ##idal suite with extra mirrors and stool ##s for us to get ready the morning of the wedding , and quickly came to straight ##en up the room before our photographer arrived . Tracy in sales was great at setting up our block of rooms and answering my questions along the way . Our guests did have some difficulty na ##vi ##gating between the hotel and our reception venue via the p ##ed ##way . Looking back I would have requested more sign ##age to direct our guests between the 2 venues . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We booked this room 2 days before our stay and at a discount ; to be honest , we did not expect it to be great . The property is old but very well maintained and has lots of old school class ; meets the ' clean / quiet / safe ' expectation . We were given an upper floor room with a lake view ( between neighboring buildings ) . The room was small but very comfortable ; the mini ##bar was well stock ##ed and not outrage ##ous . The shower was gorgeous . The lobby bar looked nice but we did not have time to try it out . the staff was very pleasant . Park ##ing was price ##y but it is Chicago - our car was delivered quickly when asked . We will stay here again ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] This hotel used to be our go - to in Chicago . We were worried about the age of the hotel , but everything looked updated and p ##rist ##ine . I love their staff , and their rooms offer a gorgeous view all while being close to everything . It ' s easy to walk or grab an u ##ber and head out to the best restaurants . However , aside from their excellent customer service , our shining point of our vacation was Le Bar and their incredible bartender ##s . I will always return to this hotel in Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The location of this hotel was spot on , the area its in is fantastic , easy walk into town , close to subway , perfect for getting to the lake which we enjoyed running down in the morning , & great bars and restaurants all a couple of blocks away . Room ##s were a decent size and very reasonable for the price . Bed was com ##fy as well and maid ##s came in every day and were always friendly and chat ##ty Happy hour in the bar is nice as well [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have stayed at the Monaco for years and the staff and rooms are great . The restaurant is new and tries a little to hard to be a go ##ur ##met establishment without taking care of the basic ##s . For example , the only salad on the menu is a ka ##le salad . I think most people would consider ka ##le and acquired taste at best . Simple things like a Ce ##asa ##r salad or a steak would be a reasonable option for a hotel restaurant . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I highly recommend the Talbot ##t Hotel for anyone visiting Chicago ! The location , staff and amenities are fantastic ! It is an easy walk to see many sites around Chicago . The access to shopping and restaurants is very convenient ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] The H ##ya ##tt Regency staff are so court ##eous and helpful . They went out of their way to assist me with my needs , from toilet ##ries to lost computer peripheral ##s . I look forward to a future stay at this property . [SEP]
1	[CLS] In addition to the beautifully appointed lobby , public areas and room , the service of staff in re ##tri ##ev ##ing - and es ##p . preserving for later re ##tri ##eval - left behind Valentine flowers was above and beyond ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was our first stay at the Conrad since they relocated . It was great ! We were created on the street as we arrived and the entire staff was friendly and helpful during our stay . Our room was amazing . We can ’ t wait to return ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We loved this hotel ! It was a first class experience in the beautiful Gold Coast area . Walking distance from the lake , Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mike , and Restoration Hard ##ware where br ##unch is a must . The beds are comfortable , the carpet ##ing is notably soft on your feet , and the lobby is huge yet co ##zy . Friendly , helpful staff ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed in the T ##ran ##qui ##lity Suite - 111 ##1 . The room was absolutely stunning . From the moment that we stepped foot on the property the staff were amazing the con ##cier ##ge , bell hop , v ##alet and front desk . They knew our names , remembered that it was our son ' s 2nd birthday and really helped make the birthday celebration special . I would recommend this hotel for families ( especially the suite with the extra space ) , couples or traveling solo . The location is prime , the window seats in the rooms are f ##abulous and the food at the restaurant was superb . We normally stay at another downtown Chicago property , but will book here when we visit again in February for a weekend get away just the two of us . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and really enjoyed it . It wasn ' t our first trip to Chicago and wanted to do all of the tourist ##y things . We stayed there Mo ##d Jan and found it very easy to walk to everything we wanted to do . Very close to the bean , close to the navy pier , etc . We really enjoyed the location as well as the view . We asked for a room facing the river and were really impressed ! Our room had a great view and a nice little sitting area ! Window seat if you will . Beautiful both day and night . The hotel itself is great . The room and lobby both were welcoming and had tons of character . Best bonus - F ##RE ##E wine from 5 - 6 ! Or maybe 6 - 7 ? ? Lo ##l but I know it ' s free ! The hot ##e was priced great compared to other options we checked out . [SEP]
1	[CLS] First time staying at the new location . Previously stayed at the old location and other con ##rad ' s . usually Conrad ' s are well known for their con ##cier ##ge . . . . but not here ( the con ##cier ##ge at the old location was awesome ! ) ! There is no con ##cier ##ge desk and the con ##cier ##ge was not helpful . We were looking for cu ##bs tickets , and basically where told to use T ##ick ##et ##master or s ##tub ##hu ##b . . . . never saw this at a Conrad before ! Also , being Hilton diamond , we were not given any room upgrade , even though asked and the app showed upgraded rooms available at time of check ##in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here while my husband and I went to see a show . It was truly amazing . Large spacious room , great house keeping and room service . Everyone was great . Will be staying here again in August for a conference . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I ' m so happy I came across this hotel . Not only is it in a great location , but the service is excellent and friendly . The check in and check out processes were easy and fast , cab ##s easily obtained for onward ( or city ) journeys , and w ##if ##i was free and fast ( though you do have to sign up for their rewards program ) . The hotel is clean and well - maintained with good amenities - rooms are co ##zy and ours was quite spacious . Co ##st for value is excellent . And I loved the little details : the funk ##y pictures and mirror frames , the color schemes , the animal print bath ##robe ##s . Great touches that made for a unique and enjoyable experience . I would definitely stay here again . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great value , location , bar , restaurant . Room de ##cor a little under ##w ##hel ##ming and tired . My third stay in last 7 years , twice in last two . We love it for the price . Very friendly staff . Only one elevator worked entire time which was a minor in ##con ##ven ##ience . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place , close to one of Chicago ' s largest business center , walking distance from parks , attractions , shops and restaurants . A ##cco ##mm ##oda ##tions are excellent as well , building connects with food courts , posts office and restaurants as well . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very delight ##ful service , walk ##able to most venues in downtown Chicago . The rooms clean , value of money proposition in the heart of Down town . Perfect place for the theatre action . Food is good in the Italian restaurant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Yeah , the hotel is older , but it is definitely a classic . It has a great parking garage that is attached to the hotel . The rooms were a little smaller than newer hotels , but we had a room with two bathroom ##s which was awesome for a family . The location is awesome . It is a little south of the River and W ##ack ##er Drive , but still close enough to walk . By being across the street from Grant Park made you really feel a different type of Chicago . The only negative was the cost of the b ##uff ##et . For a family of four , spending $ 150 on breakfast was not very cool . I would definitely , vote for other lower cost options than eating at the breakfast b ##uff ##et . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This is a small , but great hotel . The service is excellent ! My room was very quiet and comfortable . This is a bout ##ique hotel and the de ##cor of the rooms , restaurant , and lobby make it feel unique and interesting . The location is hard to beat ; it ' s downtown and near restaurants , coffee shops , and shopping . Love ##d it ! [SEP]
0	[CLS] We couldn ’ t have been more pleased with our stay at the So ##fit ##el Chicago Ma ##gni ##fic ##ent Mile ! The location was great ! Close to the train and shopping . The staff was very nice and a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting . The room was beautiful and extremely comfortable . We definitely would stay here again on a return trip to Chicago . [SEP]
1	[CLS] There was only one elevator working which made the wait time very long and crowded elevators were very uncomfortable and un ##safe . Our room was not cleaned . I found several long hairs in the bathroom and on the sink . St ##ain ##s on the sofa , din ##gy comfort ##er on the bed . Dec ##or looked very old . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If I can say one thing about this hotel is the staff is amazing . If you want a night on the town go see Melissa ( Con ##cier ##ge ) she knows all the best places . If you are more in the mood for not leaving the hotel , Bell ##y up to the bar for amazing drinks and most importantly the company from Eric to De ##met ##rie to ( the morning bartender I can ' t remember his name . D ##AR ##N ! ) He was great ! We would have stayed at the bar all day . The room was great , the check in check out a breeze . IF you are looking for somewhere great to stay this is it ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] In town for a conference not at this hotel . Book ##ed b ##c of its location to the host hotel . This hotel was much better than the other . Location is awesome ! Service too ! Beautiful ! Be sure to get your shoes shine ##d , even he ' s amazing ! ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the o ##m ##ni in no ##ve ##mber . The hotel is lovely amazing location and huge rooms we had a suit with a large king bed a sit ##ton ##g room and large bathroom . Its located just off the ma ##g mile with so much to do near buy and the staff are so helpful and friendly will def ##o stay again [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hotel All ##egro is uniquely decorated and is a re ##f ##reshing change from standard hotel chain de ##cor . The check - in and v ##alet staff were incredibly friendly and helpful . We only stayed one night for a wedding . Our standard room was very small but was all we needed for a one night stay . If you are wanting more space I would highly suggest a bigger room . Also be prepared to pay for W ##if ##i unless you have Kim ##pton rewards ; it is unfortunately not free for guests . My main complaint is that the bathroom was not very clean . There was tooth paste s ##p ##latter on the mirror and hair in the shower . It is an " i ##cky " feeling when you go to shower and see a hair ball on the wall and long hairs on the bath mat . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent location to stay in Chicago , every thing is on a walking distance from hotel , Very friendly staff , specially Vale ##t parking staff is very good . That was my second stay in Chicago in winter time main thing is location specially if your are in a different country and do not know too much then we definitely need helping staff that is what we find in H ##ya ##t [SEP]
1	[CLS] Have been coming to H ##ya ##tt for conferences in December for 6 years now . The location is excellent and I like the fact you can go to several fast food options without leaving the building , especially in December . They also have an a ##gi ##le restaurant that can accommodate large groups without long waits . The rooms for the conference serve the purpose well , different sizes with good sound . Also the large ex ##po area is fun and very large , I always get lost since it accommodate ##s so many exhibits . Great overall experience [SEP]
1	[CLS] L ##O ##VE ##D everything about our stay at the Ki ##nz ##ie . Dec ##ided to make a last minute trip to Chicago and found the Ki ##nz ##ie . It is in a super location for walking to our favorite spots . Check in was super quick and easy . We were given token ##s for drinks - - which we enjoyed on the 6th floor lounge before heading out for the evening . Room was spacious . Bed was S ##UP ##ER comfortable and clean . TV was huge ! Bath ##room was really nice . In the morning , took a tray out to the hall on our floor and brought eggs , coffee and baked goods back to the room to enjoy on the com ##fy couch . What a great treat ! Would certainly return to the Ki ##nz ##ie ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We picked this location based on its location and the size of the room which was actually a suite . The suite was larger than our first apartment ! The kitchen area had a big refrigerator , microwave , dish ##wash ##er and cook ##top . There is plenty of room to store luggage and shopping bags . We used v ##alet parking which was fast and at ##ten ##tive . We found it strange that when we walked in the only thing in the lobby was the v ##alet attendant , you have to go up to the 6th floor to check in . This hotel is within easy walking distance of shopping and dining . The pool area has a great view . [SEP]
1	[CLS] High ##ly recommend this hotel ! Staff were amazing and helpful . The rooms are super fancy with black ##out options for the room and different lighting options . TV was huge and fun to watch . Internet access was perfect . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This hotel is located within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants . The rooms are so spacious we were able to hold committee meetings in them . The staff is very friendly and the breakfast and evening food offerings are good . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I spent two nights celebrating a special birthday . We started by meeting Maria Claudio , who checked us in . She was helpful , friendly , court ##eous and dedicated to making sure our stay would be full of good memories . . . she succeeded ! The hotel is perfectly located on the Chicago River with scenic views of the city , lake and river . It ' s an easy walk to the River ##walk , Navy Pier and Millennium Park . A perfect get ##away without breaking the bank . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Excellence Is the best word I can use to describe Conrad ! I ’ ve stayed at several hotels in Chicago and this one stands out ! ! I look forward to my next visit ! Now the new giant Star ##bu ##cks Reserve is right next door ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at this hotel for five nights for a conference and enjoyed it immensely . The sports bar is a great place to eat at night and has a good craft beer selection . The health club is good enough and if spa ##s are your thing it looks like it has a very nice spa . My room was great with a very comfortable bed and excellent , free w ##if ##i . One of the best parts is this hotel is connected underground to the A ##ON Center , so you can go to Star ##bu ##cks , Au Bon Pain , and other quick service restaurants . There ' s a G ##ior ##dan ##o ' s Pizza one block away and Michigan Avenue and W ##ack ##er Drive are also just a block or two away . I walked everywhere . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We couldn ' t have chosen a better location as this is right on the river ##walk , and convenient ##ly walking distance to everything ! Being able to walk downstairs and have the Chicago Burger Company available as well as a 5 minute walk from boat tours & public bikes . Also the walk to Millennium Park is a breeze as you get to sight see , go through cool cafe ##s like N ##ute ##lla or Wild ##berry . Also the Navy Pier was an easy walk or bike ride away . The staff were super welcoming . The v ##alet / bell ##men have a great smile as you pull up and always so kind and fun to chat with . Victoria at the Front Des ##k was extremely helpful and patient during our check in . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our law firm recently held a fund ##raiser for 25 people in The Gallery Room at the Talbot ##t Hotel . L ##yn ##sey R ##uck , the Cat ##ering Sales Manager , was the reason why our night was such a success . She , along with the rest of the staff , cater ##ed to our every need . When it rain ##ed , she quickly drew guests inside . She wasn ' t the server , but made sure that every guest had a drink and a plate of food . We put in 2 orders of the Hu ##mm ##us Plate but since we ended up only needing one , we were not charged for the second . L ##yn ##sey and the Talbot ##t Hotel went above and beyond to make sure our experience was perfect . And it absolutely was . [SEP]
1	[CLS] One of only several hotels in 50 years of travel come up to the level of my e ##4 ##x ##per ##ience at the O ##m ##ni . The staff were overwhelming ##ly a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and helpful . I was so pleased with everything . And I am normally a f ##uss ##y c ##rank . Thanks . John Len ##key III [SEP]
1	[CLS] Charge ##d $ 2000 for two nights at $ 155 / night - even when I was not supposed to be charged at all since my company was paying the bill . They had my card on file and the minute I gave them my name my card was automatically charged [SEP]
1	[CLS] Room ##s are out ##dated , no exhaust fans in the bathroom ##s , so when shower ##ing , even with bathroom door closed , the entire room feels like a sa ##una . due to the humidity in the room , the ceiling paint is fl ##aking and falling to the floor . The walls are paper thin , so you hear everything and definitely request a room away from the elevators . Bar and lobby are nice , but the guest rooms are below average . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Absolutely amazing staff and service ! ! ! My stay with them was amazing ! Rita and Tony and Dwight made the stay feel like I was at home . I highly recommend staying here and will definitely be back at that hotel ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We had a suite facing the Chicago Tribune building and it was beat ##ui ##ful at night . Quiet hotel with space to walk around in the room . Breakfast was great and is in ##cu ##lded with your stay . S ##hout out to Jeremy who worked the floor during the morning . He was kind and helpful . I took off a star because the couch needed attention . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I spent 3 nights here while visiting the city . We loved everything about it . Nice , modern , clean room , with an evening reception and daily breakfast . The staff are very helpful and nice too . The hotel is also in a great location . If you do stay there make sure and grab at least one meal at Public House . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The Ambassador Chicago is an un ##fo ##rge ##tta ##ble place to stay . The staff were very warm and friendly . B ##re Smith was one of the key staff that I ’ ve interact ##ed with . She provided excellent feedback about the hotel and its history . Upon arrival to my room , the soft touch of color and clean am ##bie ##nce truly placed me at ease . I love the little touches of art de ##cor across the room . One my favorite spot is looking over the city . There is just something about it . At night , I ’ ve experienced the co ##zy and chill Library . Thank you B ##re and the rest of staff for your hospitality . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I have to sat this was one of the best experiences I have had with a hotel . The hotel is very trend ##y and ch ##ic , and is in a location . The rooms have great views and are very spacious and comfortable . I was especially impressed with the yoga mat ##t and 24 / 7 yoga provided since I am a yo ##gi . We also enjoyed the wine happy hour greatly ! But what made this stay so special with the staff , particularly Sheila G ##ar ##g the Chief Con ##cier ##ge . I cannot put into words how helpful she was before and during our stay . She help arrange activities , dinner , etc . I am not easily impressed but she did so and more . Please do not hesitate to book this hotel , you will not be disappointed ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] For the past few years whenever we go to Chicago we stay here . The big picture windows with window seats are perfect for my son ( he likes sleeping in them ! ) , and for the dogs that travel with us ! The staff are friendly and always helpful ( offering dog bowls , dog beds , have dog treats , etc ) . The door ##man Antonio is amazing ! He is super helpful with any questions you have , very nice and always made a point to give my son high five ##s . The only down ##side is the new rest ##ura ##nt they have on ##site . It is a little too " fancy " for our taste ( o ##yster ##s , etc ) . But luck ##ily there is a great rest ##ura ##nt right across the street ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great hotel , staff , and bars . Everything was amazing from check in to check out ! We plan to come back very soon based on our stay ! We decided last minute to stay downtown and it was simply amazing ! Very happy with this hotel [SEP]
1	[CLS] always a nice place to stay ; bar and lounge area takes you back in time . rooms clean and close to shopping . Just wish hotel parking was not so expensive . Some parts of the lobby could use some updates . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Very clean , close to wonderful attractions , friendly staff , lots of light in the rooms . Room ##s are private and quiet . Con ##cier ##ge was very helpful with recommendations of food , directions and Chicago history . [SEP]
0	[CLS] Service was fantastic but the beds were the worst my family and I have ever slept on . The hotel is beautiful and the staff was wonderful . The room itself wasn ’ t very plea ##sing to the eye . The view was terrible as all we had to look at was other buildings . As I said before the beds were the worst I have ever slept on . [SEP]
1	[CLS] stayed a few days with friends . Hotel was nice . Room was nice size and quiet . Didn ' t eat breakfast but did the evening snack thing and that was good . I wanted to do a shout out to front desk clerk Adrian ##a who was helpful and so nice and also to tell her brother Eduardo that I said H ##II ##II ##II ##II ! ! ! ha ##ha ##ha : ) great stay [SEP]
0	[CLS] I would like to thank J ##ac ##inda and Annie for the very inform ##ative tour . I was the only one on this tour but they spent the time and energy for the entire time . Thanks ! Next time I stay will bring my wife on the tour . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend it . We had a great view and it was in a nice area of the city . The room was nice and clean and the bathroom was large . Some parts of our room needed a little cleaning / up ##dating but overall I would definitely recommend it . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Got in a little earlier than expected on Saturday and front desk was very a ##cco ##mm ##oda ##ting and had a room ready for us . Room was beautiful and had a great view . Had a snack at Potter ##s located in hotel and also had great friendly service . [SEP]
1	[CLS] During my stay at the All ##egro , I have asked the front desk 3 times , to remove a dead bird outside my window . The bird is still there . This is just not acceptable . The dead bird is on the fire escape and should be easy to get to so I am not sure this situation has not been addressed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d this hotel . Clean good sized room with modern bathroom and great hotel facilities . Plus , absolutely everything is on your doors ##tep , including some fantastic restaurants . And close to a stop on the L which will take you direct to W ##rig ##ley Field . See the Cubs , a great way to spend an evening . [SEP]
1	[CLS] The staff are knowledge ##able , professional and cu ##rt ##ious . The hotel is very clean , other than old carpet in our room , everything else was perfect . The location is also wonderful , as it is a walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the Navy Pier . The experience was very enjoyable . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Excellent package for parking and breakfast . Facility , Location , and staff are great . The location is in the heart of Michigan Ave and this was a Christmas ex ##cursion that met all expectations . Our only disappointment was learning that the Michigan Ave . C ##rate and Barr ##el is closing . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Too ##k a weekend trip with the kids . . . almost caught a contact high from all the weed smoking right in front of the building . . . Room was dirty . . . T ##WI ##CE . Didn ’ t even bother 2nd time to complain , was too tired . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Our last night here and as a Diamond member I asked for a late check ##out and was flat out told NO ! I wouldn ' t mind but it came with an attitude . There are plenty of other Hilton properties in the neighborhood that I suggest you stay . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Great place to have a conference . I was very satisfied by the location and food at the restaurant . We received a good rate for the meeting as well . I would come back for personal trip and also again for the meeting . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel . Excellent location . Close to the Ma ##g Mile . Matt ##resses could use an update . Bar area was very nice . Food choices in there were excellent . Lots of good restaurants within walking distance . Con ##cier ##ge was very helpful . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Nice hotel but the website is de ##ceiving . It gives you an option to pay for v ##alet parking with your reservation for $ 30 , it does not tell you that if you don ' t pay for it at the time of your reservation it is $ 64 at the hotel . The manager was unwilling to fix this . It also lists w ##if ##i under amenities . It is actually $ 10 . 95 at the hotel . I don ' t mind paying but I feel like the website is misleading and that makes me feel s ##cam ##med . I will not return . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The So ##fit ##el Chicago is a nice hotel , no doubt . We found a tremendous deal online for our one night in the Wind ##y City . I liked that they let us check in early . That way we were able to get everything out of the car and have the room situated . The rooms are on the small side . Great views ! Excellent bathroom , and excellent linen ##s ! I didn ' t care for the fact that there is no in room refrigerator . I would stay again if we had a deal like this , otherwise I ' d roll the dice on another luxury property in the city . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We ' ve stayed at a bunch of hotels in the downtown area of Chicago , and the Monaco was one of those I had to look for things to complain about . All I could come up with was " no coffee machine in the room " , then my wife pointed out that it was on the list of things I could request to have sent up . Wow . Great location , excellent service . They serve free coffee in the morning and have wine in the evening . Room ##s are very nice , the hotel is a good size for the amount of elevators ( you never wait minutes for an elevator ) . Overall , this is a great hotel . [SEP]
1	[CLS] This was in an excellent location in downtown Chicago . It was within walking distance of excellent dining and shopping . We would stay here on our next trip ! The breakfast was always fresh and slightly different . The staff was really helpful and pleasant . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Hilton Chicago has a great property and rooms . Con ##ven ##ient location in downtown to what we needed . Market ##place in the lobby was very convenient . Room service was good . May return again in the future if the value is good . [SEP]
0	[CLS] R ##uben was great : friendly , professional , and his advice spot - on . The choices he suggested were absolutely delicious and perfectly paired . I couldn ’ t decide between two excellent app ##eti ##zers , and he gave such Look forward to coming back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] We won a v ##ou ##cher for a free stay from our daughters school fund ##raiser and decided to use it for our Anniversary . The service was phenomena ##l ! We were given a few extra drink token ##s for the evening reception because of our celebration and then upgraded to a suite . S ##pect ##ac ##ular views , contemporary rooms , lovely visit . Continental breakfast on every floor was a nice per ##k . Love this hotel & will definitely go back ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] Such an awesome place to stay . Walking distance to practically everything at the loop and pretty much has a great view of the Chicago Loop area . The room is com ##fy , spacious and just down ##right amazing . From the bed to the small touches of amenities all over created a stay worth ##while . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Clean rooms , most amenities excluding the compliment ##ary bottle water - really . . . the lobby bar closed at 10 : 30 - odd for a downtown hotel . . . the hotel has an attached Palm Restaurant , decent steak ##house plus . Overall , not a top pick - the little things are missing [SEP]
1	[CLS] Each time that I stay at the Swiss I receive the depend ##able service and super clean accommodation ##s that I have come to expect and enjoy . You can ' t go wrong with the Swiss . The location is great and the views can be spectacular . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Gene the con ##cier ##ge was the best ! Door man was awesome too ! Park ##ing could have been cheaper - only reason I am not giving 5 stars . Room was clean except for a small stain on the sheets but they changed the sheets as I requested . Would stay here again . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I was thrilled to have the opportunity to stay here on the last night of my recent visit to Chicago . Everyone went out of their way to make my stay very pleasant . K ##wa ##me at the front desk was super in his handling of my reservation and offered me an upgrade . The room was beautiful and I was sorry when it was time to leave . I ' ll definitely want to stay here on my next visit . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed here for 2 nights , maybe we were spoiled by the W ##ynn in Las Vegas , but the hotel in severely let down by the rooms . Location is great , bar was great but the rooms are 1970 ' s like ( a key for the safe ? - come on ) . The room we had the carpet was stained and marked , the curtains were full of dust , the air ##con blows directly onto you in bed - and the beds ##hee ##ts had stain ##s on them . Also , a lot of outside noise was heard ( even though we were 17 floors up ) . This should be a fantastic 5 start hotel , the location is brilliant , the staff were great - but it needs a severe make ##over . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at this hotel for one night in November of this year . I was attending a workshop at the G ##lous ##ter Center at the University of Chicago which is only 2 blocks away . The hotel is well situated and walking distance from Michigan Avenue . The room was very clean but showing age - especially in the hallway ##s , doors , and carpet ##ing . I booked through Hot ##wire . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Love ##d our room and the proximity to great shopping and dining . The beds were soft and co ##zy . Our room was spot ##less and inviting on a corner with two windows facing different directions . If you like to stay in and watch TV , the screens are large enough you can enjoy them from bed . [SEP]
1	[CLS] If you book other than direct with them , they don ##t care about your complaints and blame it on 3rd party booking instead of taking care of their g ##ues . The rooms are too small , not getting same rooms on same reservation . Bed was uncomfortable , slept right next to the door , hear everything . Type ##s , they didn ' t care . . . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I spent 3 nights at the Talbot ##t and enjoyed it immensely . While it has been u ##d ##pate ##d , it retains the character of an older hotel . The staff was superb . i must meet 200 characters minimum . silly requirement . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I was at the Intercontinental to attend a three - day business seminar . The hotel property , the staff , the attention to detail could not be better . I would definitely recommend this property for business or pleasure . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Stay ##ed at the She ##rato ##n for 9 days attending a conference with 600 colleagues . Super comfortable beds and reasonable sized rooms . Excellent location , close to Michigan Ave and Navy Pier . The food served at the conference dinner was excellent - particularly given the size of the crowd . A good She ##rato ##n experience . [SEP]
0	[CLS] I stay here when I visit Chicago for work . It is well located , near the metro station and eat access to the airport . I usually have at least one meal in the restaurant , and it is always with exceptional service . It feels like an older hotel , but with modern convenience ##s . Always a great stay ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] My wife and I loaded up our 2 dogs for Chicago . S ##pent 2 nights there , front desk staff loved playing with our dogs . On the morning we were leaving our brand new vehicle had a mechanical issue and the v ##alet ##s were very helpful in any way they could be . Room was smaller but with the friend ##liness of the staff I would return . [SEP]
1	[CLS] We stayed at the So ##fit ##el this summer . Check was easy as was check out . Our room was perfect . I ’ ve stayed at the So ##fit ##el hotel in Paris so I am familiar with the brand , it did not di ##sa ##pp ##oint here in the states . We also ate at one of the restaurants on site , everything was delicious . The location is prime as well . You will not be disappointed Would I stay here again ? Yes I would and would absolutely recommend it ! ! [SEP]
1	[CLS] The hotel looks great and staff are friendly and helpful . Room was clean . Room service was shut down the entire duration of my stay ( 3 - 4 days ) though , which was disappointing . Also the ventilation system in the room was a bit noisy . [SEP]
1	[CLS] I stayed at Fair ##mont for work but just to get the in ##vo ##ice for my stay I had to go through hell . When I called the person answering the phone and even the hotel manager was extremely rude , put me on hold for more than 10 minutes . I had to get the in ##vo ##ice for the expenses to be approved . Ho ##rrible staff would never stay there . [SEP]
1	[CLS] Had a nice stay here . Thank you so much to D ##wayne ! He was so helpful and brought my bag out to the car so quickly - before I could even do it myself ! I really appreciate it - it made my day that much easier : ) [SEP]
0	[CLS] So ##fit ##el Water ##tower has a te ##rri ##fic location steps from Michigan Ave , right in the heart of the Gold Coast . You will find all staff at this hotel from the door man to the front desk , to those se ##r ##vic ##ing your room , to restaurant waits ##ta ##ff un ##fa ##iling ##ly pleasant and eager to help . Unfortunately , the rooms are getting run down and s ##hab ##by ; which given the price point is not acceptable . A hotel of this caliber should not have torn carpet , stained up ##hol ##ster ##y and furniture showing a lot of wear and tear . Time for a re ##f ##resh of the rooms ; the bones are there , but they are showing their age . [SEP]
1	[CLS] My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary over July 4th , 2018 and could not have been more pleased . From the staff greeting us at the door , calling an elevator for us . We arrived early , they checked our luggage as we went out for the afternoon . Upon our return our luggage was in our beautiful corner suite with a view . Thank you for the upgrade ! Every staff member we meet was exceptional , especially our housekeeper . Conrad must have an outstanding training program and seem to value their staff . Well done ! We will definitely be back . Thank you again for making our weekend so special . [SEP]
0	[CLS] The costumes service is excellent , people is nice , efficient , they really care about their costume ##r ' s experience ! ! ! Besides that , food is delicious and they can s ##po ##il you at your room with a " at your room spa " E ##X ##CE ##LL ##EN ##T [SEP]
1	[CLS] The price is high . They didn ’ t say anything about parking they charge $ 71 a night . I found a parking garage 1 block away for less than $ 30 a night The in room refrigerator is stock ##ed with different drinks which are ridiculous ##ly priced $ 12 for a bottle of water . snack ##s were $ 7 for a candy bar . There was no room for any of your personal drinks or food Room size was large The chair in room not very comfortable The shower lever pulled off in my hand They seem to cater to the rich . [SEP]
